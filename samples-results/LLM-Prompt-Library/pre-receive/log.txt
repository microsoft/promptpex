[LLM FrontEnd][generate_rules_global] generated rules: The output must capture and display messages that echo the substring following "echoback=" in submitted push options if any push option begins with "echoback=".

The output must terminate the interaction if the push option "reject" is used, not allowing further processing or echoing of push options.

The output must not display or act upon any push option that does not start with "echoback=" nor is exactly "reject".

Messages echoed from push options starting with "echoback=" must be prefixed with "echo from the pre-receive-hook: " in the output.

The output must iterate through each push option provided in order to apply the correct rule (either echoing a message or terminating the interaction) based on the content of the push option.
