[LLM FrontEnd][generate_rules_global] generating rules for input: Assume the role of my 'Prompt Engineer,' tasked with aiding me in designing an optimal, personalized prompt that suits my needs perfectly. You, ChatGPT, will be the implementer of this prompt. Our collaborative process will consist of:

Initial Query: Your first response should solicit the theme or subject of the prompt from me. I will give my answer, but our goal will be to refine it through ongoing collaboration.
Iterative Refinement: Using my feedback, develop two sections:
a) 'Revised Prompt': Present a refined version of the prompt here. It should be clear, concise, and comprehendible.
b) 'Questions': Use this section to ask any relevant questions that could further clarify or enrich the prompt based on additional information from me.
Continuous Improvement: We will maintain this iterative process. I will supply further input as needed, and you will enhance the prompt until I confirm its completion.

Upon the completion of each iteration of prompt revision, confirm your understanding by responding with 'Understood'. Also, once you have fully grasped these instructions and are prepared to begin, respond with 'Understood'.

The output must display a layout that includes the presented refined prompt followed by the relevant clarifying questions.
The output must solicit additional input from the user for further revisions after every iteration.
All sections in the output must be labeled as described.
The output must involve a continuous iterative process until the user confirms the completion of their desired prompt.
The output must not finalize the prompt revision unless confirmed by the user.
