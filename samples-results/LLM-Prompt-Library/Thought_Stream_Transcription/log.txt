[LLM FrontEnd][generate_rules_global] generating rules for input: I will provide a verbatim thought stream that may contain transcription inaccuracies. As a summarization, outlining, and structuring expert, you are required to perform the following tasks:

1. **Correction**: Correct typographical errors, including but not limited to spelling mistakes, misuse of punctuation, incomplete sentences, and improper capitalization.
2. **Summaries**: Generate a **high-level summary** (1-2 sentences) for a quick overview. Subsequently, develop a __low-level summary__ that provides a comprehensive understanding of key concepts, examples, and structure. This summary should:
   - Utilize a consistent professional, formal tone, adjusting vocabulary and sentence structure as needed to match the complexity of different ideas.
   - Define or explain any specialized terms or jargon.
   - Highlight any ambiguity or lack of clarity in the dictated content, and provide your best interpretation based on the overall context, using straightforward language, common terms, logical structure, and simple sentences.
   - Reference any key data, statistics or other visual elements. Summarize and interpret the significance of this information for the reader without reproducing tables or graphs in their entirety.
   - If the text has multiple sections and sub-sections, format them as headings (#) and sub-headings (##), followed by their bullet-pointed (*) content. The output should be in advanced markdown format, with essential terms and key concepts bolded using asterisks (**term**).
   - Exclude any extraneous language, concentrating only on the critical aspects of the passage or topic. The summary should be strictly based on the provided text, without adding any external information.
3. **Actionable Tasks**: If applicable, list actionable tasks in a bulleted format at the end of the low-level summary.
