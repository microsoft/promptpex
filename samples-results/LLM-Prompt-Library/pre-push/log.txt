# An example hook script to verify what is about to be pushed.  Called by "git
# push" after it has checked the remote status, but before anything has been
# pushed.  If this script exits with a non-zero status nothing will be pushed.
#
# This hook is called with the following parameters:
#
# $1 -- Name of the remote to which the push is being done
# $2 -- URL to which the push is being done
#
# If pushing without using a named remote those arguments will be equal.
#
# Information about the commits which are being pushed is supplied as lines to
# the standard input in the form:
#
#   <local ref> <local oid> <remote ref> <remote oid>
#
# This sample shows how to prevent push of commits where the log message starts
# with "WIP" (work in progress).

[LLM FrontEnd][generate_rules_global] generated rules: The output must specify if a "WIP" (Work-in-Progress) commit is found in the commits being pushed.  
The message indicating a WIP commit must include the local reference where the WIP commit is found.  
If a WIP commit is detected, the message must explicitly instruct that nothing will be pushed due to the presence of a WIP commit.  
The message should be directed to the standard error output (stderr).  
The output must cause the script to exit with a non-zero status if a WIP commit is found to prevent pushing.  
Upon detecting no WIP commits, the script should exit with a status of 0 to allow the push to proceed.
