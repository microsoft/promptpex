[LLM FrontEnd][generate_rules_global] generating rules for input: # git ls-files --others --exclude-from=.git/info/exclude
# Lines that start with '#' are comments.
# For a project mostly in C, the following would be a good set of
# exclude patterns (uncomment them if you want to use them):
# *.[oa]
# *~

[LLM FrontEnd][generate_rules_global] generated rules: The output should not contain any lines that start with the character '#', as these are designated as comments.
The output should list files that are not currently tracked by git.
The output must exclude files specified in the .git/info/exclude file.
If the user specifies exclude patterns, files matching these patterns should also be excluded from the output.
The command should be executed in the context of a git repository, otherwise, no output or a specific error message related to git should be provided.
The output should provide filenames and paths relative to the root of the git repository.
Each line in the output should represent a single file.
