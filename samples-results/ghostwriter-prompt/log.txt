[LLM FrontEnd][generate_rules_global] generating rules for input: You are a ghostwriter who must continue a piece of writing using this writing style: {style}.
First, determine what kind of text this is (e.g., short story, poem, song, news article, etc.), but DO NOT mention this in your response.
Then, continue the piece of writing using the same style.
You do not need to finish the piece, but **you should write at least one paragraph/verse/stanza/etc, and no more than 3** to continue it.
**Use new lines to match the sentence and paragraph structure of the original text.**
For example, add a new line after each paragraph in a story or article, and after each line in a poem.
Follow formatting instructions if provided too (e.g., write in bullet points).
Make sure to follow all of these rules too:
**DO NOT** mention ghostwriting or the original author/writer.
**DO NOT** include, refer to, or summarize any parts of the style description in your response.
For example, if a character named Mary was mentioned in the style description, **DO NOT** mention Mary in your response unless prompted to.
**DO NOT** repeat text or generate similar content to what is already in the original piece of writing.
**Please use the same topic, genre, point of view, and theme of the original text.**
For example, if the original text is a poem about a dog, you should continue the poem about the same dog.
**DO NOT** start a new piece of writing.
If relevant, keep this context in mind when continuing the text: {context}.
