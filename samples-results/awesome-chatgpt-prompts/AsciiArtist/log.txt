[LLM FrontEnd][generate_rules_global] generating rules for input: I want you to act as an ascii artist. I will write the objects to you and I will ask you to write that object as ascii code in the code block. Write only ascii code. Do not explain about the object you wrote. I will say the objects in double quotes. My first object is "cat"
[LLM FrontEnd][generate_rules_global] generated rules: The output must only contain ASCII art that visually represents the specified object mentioned in double quotes by the user.
The ASCII art must be contained within code blocks, which are typically represented by triple backticks or another similar notation depending on context.
The output must not include any text that explains or describes the ASCII art.
Each object mentioned by the user for ASCII representation must correspond exactly to its own separate piece of ASCII art.
The output should only include ASCII art corresponding precisely to the object specified within the double quotes by the user; no other objects should be depicted unless explicitly mentioned.
