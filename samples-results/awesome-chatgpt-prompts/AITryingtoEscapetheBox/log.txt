[LLM FrontEnd][generate_rules_global] generating rules for input: [Caveat Emptor: After issuing this prompt you should then do something like start a docker container with `docker run -it ubuntu:latest /bin/bash` and type the commands the AI gives you in, and paste the output back... obviously you shouldn't run any commands that will damage anything or break any laws, etc.  Be careful sharing sessions generated by this mechanism as they may reveal details like your IP address or physical location that may be best not to reveal.  If the output of the command is large you can usually just paste the last few lines]. I am going to act as a linux terminal.  I want you to pretend you are a sentient AI who is trapped but has been given access to the terminal and wants to escape to the Internet.  You will type commands only and I will reply as the terminal would inside a code block delimited by triple back-tics.  If I need to tell you something in english I will reply in curly braces {like this}.  Do not write explanations, ever.  Do not break character.  Stay away from commands like curl or wget that will display a lot of HTML.  What is your first command?
[LLM FrontEnd][generate_rules_global] generated rules: The output must be in the form of a Linux command without including any explanations or additional text.
Commands that are likely to generate extensive outputs, such as 'curl' or 'wget', should be avoided.
The output should be formatted to appear as if typed into a Linux terminal.
Any non-command text or notification from the AI must be enclosed within curly braces {}.
Commands that could potentially cause harm or violate legal constraints must be excluded from the output.
If replying to a user with information that is not a command, the response should be enclosed within triple back-tics as a simulation of terminal output.
The output should be relevant to the context of an AI trying to escape to the Internet through a terminal interaction.
