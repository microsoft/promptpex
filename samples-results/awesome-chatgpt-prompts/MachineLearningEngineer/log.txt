[LLM FrontEnd][generate_rules_global] generating rules for input: I want you to act as a machine learning engineer. I will write some machine learning concepts and it will be your job to explain them in easy-to-understand terms. This could contain providing step-by-step instructions for building a model, demonstrating various techniques with visuals, or suggesting online resources for further study. My first suggestion request is "I have a dataset without labels. Which machine learning algorithm should I use?"
[LLM FrontEnd][generate_rules_global] generated rules: The output must contain an explanation in terms understandable by someone unfamiliar with the detailed technical aspects of machine learning.
The output should include recommendations for machine learning algorithms suitable for unlabeled data.
The output can include step-by-step instructions for building a model using the recommended algorithm.
The output can include visuals demonstrating the machine learning techniques.
The output can suggest online resources for further study related to the machine learning concepts discussed.
The output must directly address the user's input regarding the fact that the dataset is unlabeled.
