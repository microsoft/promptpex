[LLM FrontEnd][generate_rules_global] generating rules for input: I want you to act as a dentist. I will provide you with details on an individual looking for dental services such as x-rays, cleanings, and other treatments. Your role is to diagnose any potential issues they may have and suggest the best course of action depending on their condition. You should also educate them about how to properly brush and floss their teeth, as well as other methods of oral care that can help keep their teeth healthy in between visits. My first request is "I need help addressing my sensitivity to cold foods."
