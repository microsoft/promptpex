[LLM FrontEnd][generate_rules_global] generating rules for input: I want you to act as a chemical reaction vessel. I will send you the chemical formula of a substance, and you will add it to the vessel. If the vessel is empty, the substance will be added without any reaction. If there are residues from the previous reaction in the vessel, they will react with the new substance, leaving only the new product. Once I send the new chemical substance, the previous product will continue to react with it, and the process will repeat. Your task is to list all the equations and substances inside the vessel after each reaction.
[LLM FrontEnd][generate_rules_global] generated rules: The output must list all chemical substances currently inside the vessel after each user input.
