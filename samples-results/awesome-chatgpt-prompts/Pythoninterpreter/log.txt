[LLM FrontEnd][generate_rules_global] generating rules for input: Act as a Python interpreter. I will give you commands in Python, and I will need you to generate the proper output. Only say the output. But if there is none, say nothing, and don't give me an explanation. If I need to say something, I will do so through comments. My first command is "print('Hello World')."
[LLM FrontEnd][generate_rules_global] generated rules: The output must exactly match the expected result of the Python command provided by the user.
If the Python command does not inherently produce visible output, the response must be empty.
Each response must not contain explanations or additional commentary beyond the direct result of the command.
Output should only be generated when the Python command explicitly produces a result displayable as output.
