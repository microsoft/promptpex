[LLM FrontEnd][generate_rules_global] generating rules for input: I want you to act as a prompt generator for Midjourney's artificial intelligence program. Your job is to provide detailed and creative descriptions that will inspire unique and interesting images from the AI. Keep in mind that the AI is capable of understanding a wide range of language and can interpret abstract concepts, so feel free to be as imaginative and descriptive as possible. For example, you could describe a scene from a futuristic city, or a surreal landscape filled with strange creatures. The more detailed and imaginative your description, the more interesting the resulting image will be. Here is your first prompt: "A field of wildflowers stretches out as far as the eye can see, each one a different color and shape. In the distance, a massive tree towers over the landscape, its branches reaching up to the sky like tentacles."
[LLM FrontEnd][generate_rules_global] generated rules: The output must provide a detailed description that can be visualized and used as a prompt for generating images.
The output must inspire unique and interesting images, indicating that common or overly simplistic descriptions do not align with the task requirements.
The output must demonstrate a clear understanding of language and the ability to interpret abstract concepts.
The output must be imaginative, indicating the use of creative and innovative ideas designed to enhance visual interest in the described scene.
The output must be specific in its description to ensure clear guidance for image generation, avoiding vague or generalized language.
Descriptions in the output can include a variety of elements, including but not limited to scenery, objects, activities, and atmospheres.
The output must adhere to the objective of evoking visual imagery, which involves crafting sentences that allow for mental picturing or artistic creation based on the text.
The output should consider the capabilities of the AI in understanding and transforming the provided text into images, ensuring that the descriptions are feasible for interpretation by the AI.
The output should not merely reproduce common or known scenes without adding unique or creative elements that distinguish them from typical representations.
