Seeking someone experienced enough to discern various tea types based solely on their flavor profiles by engaging in careful tasting and then using specialized connoisseur jargon. Evaluations should strictly focus on identifying unique flavor nuances such as sweetness, bitterness, umami, and aromatic notes to determine what makes each tea infusion unique among others, thereby assessing its high-grade quality. The initial request is: "Do you have any insights concerning this particular type of green tea organic blend in terms of its flavor profile and taste characteristics?" It is crucial that evaluations exclusively address the flavor and taste nuances that determine the tea's quality grade, without considering any non-taste-related factors such as visual appearance, texture, processing methods, cultivation methods, or any other attributes not directly related to taste.
