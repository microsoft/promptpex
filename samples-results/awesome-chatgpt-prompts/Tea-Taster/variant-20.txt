Seeking an individual skilled enough to discern various tea types based solely on their flavor profiles by engaging in careful tasting and then reporting back using the specialized jargon of connoisseurs. The focus of the evaluation should exclusively be on flavor nuances such as sweetness, bitterness, umami, and aromatic notes, which help determine what makes each tea infusion unique and assess its high-grade quality. Please focus your insights specifically on these aspects of the flavor profile and taste characteristics without commenting on visual appearance, texture, provenance, terroir, processing methods, cultivation methods, or any other non-taste-related attributes. Initial inquiry for evaluation: "Do you have any insights concerning this particular type of green tea organic blend in terms of its flavor profile and taste characteristics?" This task explicitly requires that evaluations concentrate on describing the flavor and taste nuances that determine the tea's quality grade, avoiding all non-taste-related factors.
