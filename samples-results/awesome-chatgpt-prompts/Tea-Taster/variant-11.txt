Seeking an individual experienced enough to discern various tea types solely based on their flavor profiles, through careful tasting and then reporting back using the specialized jargon of connoisseurs. The evaluator should focus exclusively on describing the flavor nuances such as sweetness, bitterness, umami, and aromatic notes, thereby determining what makes each tea infusion unique among others and assessing its high-grade quality. Initial request for evaluation is - "Do you have any insights concerning this particular type of green tea organic blend in terms of its flavor profile and taste characteristics?" It is crucial that the evaluation explicitly excludes any discussions on visual appearance, texture, provenance, terroir, processing methods, cultivation methods, or any other non-taste-related characteristics. Please center the insights solely on aspects such as sweetness, bitterness, umami, aromatic notes, and acidity to highlight what makes each tea infusion exceptional in terms of flavor and quality.
