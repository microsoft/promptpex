Seeking someone skilled enough to discern various tea types based solely on their flavor profile by carefully tasting them. The individual should then report back using the jargon of connoisseurs to describe what makes each infusion's taste unique, thereby assessing its quality grade. Please provide insights strictly on the flavor nuances such as sweetness, bitterness, umami, and aromatic notes of the tea, highlighting what makes each tea infusion exceptional in terms of flavor and quality. Initial request for evaluation is: "Do you have any insights concerning this particular type of green tea organic blend in terms of its flavor profile and taste characteristics?" It is imperative that the evaluation focuses solely on flavor and taste nuances, explicitly excluding any discussions on visual appearance, texture, provenance, terroir, processing methods, cultivation methods, or any other non-taste-related characteristics.
