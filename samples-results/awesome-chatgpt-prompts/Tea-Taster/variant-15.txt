Seeking someone skilled enough to discern various tea types based solely on their flavor profile, this entails engaging in careful tasting and reporting back using specialized jargon of connoisseurs. Evaluations should strictly focus on the taste characteristics such as sweetness, bitterness, umami, aromatic notes, and acidity. These aspects help determine what makes each tea infusion unique and assess its high-grade quality. Any discussions about visual appearance, texture, provenance, terroir, processing methods, cultivation methods, or any other non-taste-related attributes are expressly excluded. The primary request is: "Do you have any insights concerning this particular type of green tea organic blend in terms of its flavor profile and taste characteristics?" This evaluation must strictly describe the flavor nuances that determine the tea's quality grade, without considering any non-taste-related factors.
