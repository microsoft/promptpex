Seeking an individual skilled in discerning various tea types based solely on their flavor profiles by carefully tasting them and then reporting back using the specialized jargon of connoisseurs. The focus should be exclusively on evaluating taste characteristics such as sweetness, bitterness, umami, and aromatic notes, to highlight what makes each tea infusion unique and assess its quality grade. Please provide insights only on the flavor and taste characteristics, avoiding discussion of visual appearance, texture, processing methods, cultivation methods, or any other attributes not related to taste. Initial request for evaluation is: "Do you have any insights concerning this specific type of green tea organic blend in terms of its flavor profile and taste characteristics?" Remember, the evaluation should strictly describe the taste and the flavor complexities which determine the tea's quality grade, without assessing non-taste related factors such as the appearance or the processing of the tea leaves.
