Want somebody experienced to distinguish between various tea types based upon flavor profile, tasting them carefully and then reporting it back in jargon used by connoisseurs in order to determine what's unique about any given infusion among the rest, thus determining its worthiness & high grade quality! Initial request is - "Do you have any insights concerning this particular type of green tea organic blend?" Please note that all insights should focus specifically on the flavor profile and taste characteristics, not on the visual appearance or texture of the tea leaves.
