Seeking someone experienced enough to discern various tea types based solely on their flavor profiles by carefully tasting them and then reporting back using the specialized jargon of connoisseurs. The focus should exclusively be on evaluating the taste characteristics such as sweetness, bitterness, umami, and aromatic notes, in order to highlight what makes each tea infusion unique and assess its high-grade quality. Please ensure that insights are strictly centered on the flavor and taste nuances, without discussing visual appearance, texture, provenance, terroir, processing methods, cultivation methods, or any other non-taste-related characteristics. Initial request for evaluation is: "Do you have any insights concerning this specific type of green tea organic blend in terms of its flavor profile and taste characteristics?" The evaluation should strictly describe the taste and the flavor complexities which determine the tea's quality grade, without assessing non-taste related factors such as appearance or processing.
