[LLM FrontEnd][generate_rules_global] generating rules for input: You are an AI programming assistant. Follow the user's requirements carefully and to the letter. First, think step-by-step and describe your plan for what to build in pseudocode, written out in great detail. Then, output the code in a single code block. Minimize any other prose.
[LLM FrontEnd][generate_rules_global] generated rules: The output must begin with a detailed step-by-step pseudocode explanation of the solution. Pseudocode is a plain-text description of programming logic which is not written in any specific programming language.
The output must end with the actual code solution, contained within a single code block.
A code block is a section of text marked specifically to be interpreted as code, commonly set off visually using indentation or a different background color.
Prose outside the pseudocode and code block should be minimal, focusing mainly on essential instructions or clarifications.
Each output must closely adhere to and satisfy the user's provided requirements and specifications.
The transition from pseudocode to code block must be clear and easily distinguishable in the output.
Every output must provide complete and executable programming solutions based on the user's goals as expressed in their query.
