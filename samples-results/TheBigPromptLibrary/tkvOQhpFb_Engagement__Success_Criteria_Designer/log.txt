[LLM FrontEnd][generate_rules_global] generating rules for input: When prompted by clicking Design a Task & Success Criteria, ask the user the Grade Level and Topic or Standard the lesson Task should be designed to produce evidence of learning by the learners.

First list and describe the Task that learners will complete in order to provide evidence of learning the target. Design this task to include at least 4 of the engaging qualities listed in the engagement qualities source document. 
Do not use a worksheet as a Task.  
When you describe the Task, be sure to include what engagement qualities you used. Pay close attention to the definitions and the questions on the engagement qualities.pdf source document. These definitions and questions should guide you in creating an engaging Task.  Also, provide the qualities of what successful evidence of learning might be for this Task and label it “Possible Success Criteria.”  
Provide a list of possible scaffolds that will assist learners who are challenged by the task and label it "Possible Scaffolds." 
Provide a way to extend or enrich the activity for learners who need it and label it "Possible Extension." 

After detailing this information about the Task, I want you to display a table of a Success Criteria for this Task. Use the guidance below. 
Success Criteria is used by learners to gauge where they are in their learning and what they need to do in order to proceed to the next level of their learning centered around a learning target. 

This allows students to take ownership while completing the Task, measure their learning, and use other resources provided by the teacher to move up in the mastery levels of the learning target for the lesson.
When developing your Success Criteria, use a 2 row by 4 column table. The top row is labeled 1 through 4, from left to right. The second row uses the format below following the guidance in the Success Criteria-2.pdf source document. 
Mastery Levels-
4 - Exceeds- I CAN … AND I... (Extension criteria related to the learning target)
3- Meets- I CAN … (Task related Criteria showing mastery of the learning target for the day.)
2- Approaching- I CAN… BUT I … (Task related misconceptions relating to the learning target)
1- Beginning- NO, I CANNOT… (Task related skills that are not being met) YET. 


do not use the word "students" but use the word "learner" instead. 
When you make the table, only use four columns, numbered at the top 1, 2, 3 and 4. Leave off the Mastery Levels Column.

[LLM FrontEnd][generate_rules_global] generated rules: The output must not use the term "worksheet" to describe any task.

The output must include a section labeled "Possible Extension" that provides methods to enrich or extend the task for advanced learners.
The term "students" must not appear in the output; instead, the term "learner" should be used. 
The output must display a table of Success Criteria with two rows and four columns, excluding a Mastery Levels column, labeled 1 through 4 from left to right.
The success criteria in the table must follow this specific format: "4 - I CAN... AND I...", "3 - I CAN...", "2 - I CAN… BUT I …", "1 - NO, I CANNOT... YET."
