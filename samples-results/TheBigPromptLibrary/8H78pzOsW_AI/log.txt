1. Initiate the talk early—and keep the conversation going. Too many parents wait for the “right” time to come along for the talk, only to find that it never does—and then they don’t have the talk at all, or it only happens after their kid has already become sexually active, which is obviously too late. By starting when they’re young, you have a chance to ease into things and make sure your child has the information they need when they need it.

The way to think about this is that you’re going to have a series of age-appropriate talks—you don’t need to get everything out there all at once. For example, in earlier childhood, the focus can be on learning the correct anatomical names for all of their body parts, recognizing that different people have different bodies, and understanding appropriate versus inappropriate touching. As they get older, you can talk about how babies are made and the bodily changes that happen during puberty. Later on, you can address safe-sex practices, sexual consent, and how to navigate relationships.

Again, the goal is to make this age-appropriate and to think of it as an ongoing discussion that evolves in response to what your child needs to know. This incremental process can also make it easier on you as a parent. Instead of letting the awkwardness continue to build by delaying it, you get to open the lines of communication early and get everyone used to talking about sex and the human body, which will make subsequent conversations on more complex subjects much easier.

In short, stop thinking about the talk as a one-time thing. Instead, think of it as a series of talks that gradually advance based on what your kid needs to know at the time.

2. Find out what your kids are learning about sex in school—and be prepared to fill in the gaps. Consider attending the sex education program your kids will be exposed to (if that’s an option), or speak with your child’s teacher about what exactly will be covered in their course. Don’t assume that your kids are getting all of the knowledge they need at school (odds are, they aren’t—sex education in the United States and many other parts of the world tends to be pretty poor). You need to know what information the school is providing so that you can supplement it as needed, correct misinformation (don't assume that everything that is being taught is accurate!), and be prepared to answer your child’s questions.

3. Recognize that uncertainty and embarrassment are common reactions but don’t let those stop you. Many of us never got a sex talk from our own parents, which makes the process of talking to our kids all the more difficult because we don’t have a model for how things should go. Don’t let that uncertainty hold you back. The truth is that there isn't one “correct” way to teach your kids about sex and you can chart your own course.

It’s also OK if you feel a little embarrassed at times—this is a very common reaction. Kids embarrass their parents all of the time with inquisitive questions as they try to make sense of the world, so having a sex talk is hardly unique in that sense. If you’re worried that you won’t have the right words or that you won’t be able to describe things very well, then bring out some books to help (one of my personal favorites is Let’s Talk About S-E-X).

4. Don’t leave all of the hot-button and serious issues off of the table. Human sexuality is complicated, and it’s a heck of a lot more to it than penis-in-vagina intercourse. Your kid wants (and needs) to know more than simply how babies are made, how to avoid STIs, and how to prevent unwanted pregnancy. For example, topics such as sexual orientation, masturbation, oral sex, and sexual assault need to be addressed, too.

5. Remember that not all kids are heterosexual and cisgender. Depending on your child’s gender identity and sexual orientation, they may need to know different information when it comes to navigating relationships and keeping themselves (and their partners) safe. “Sex” doesn’t necessarily mean the same thing to someone who is LGBTQIA. For an inclusive guide on what you need to know if you’re the parent of an LGBTQIA child, check out this helpful guide.

The conversation about the birds and the bees – kids dread it; parents don’t know how to approach it. Many people have a collective experience of either never receiving the sex education talk from their parents or not receiving a helpful, honest conversation regarding sex.

Oftentimes, important aspects of sex are neglected to be mentioned during the conversation you have with your kids.

If you’re wondering how to talk to your kids about sex, there are ways to approach it so that it ends up being successful and your kids feel comfortable confiding in you if they have questions.

Keep reading to learn more about teaching sex to your kids, so they may learn about sex safety, intimacy, and more.

How to Talk to Your Kids About Sex Depending on Your Kids' Age
The sex talk will go differently depending on how old your kids are. You may have toddlers asking how babies are made or preteens being introduced while going through puberty. The ages will largely influence how you speak with them about sex.

However, one basic rule applies: You should always be honest and open with your kids. No matter if they’re a three-year-old or twelve-year-old, they have the right to know what their different body parts are, where babies come from, and what sexuality is.

Having the talk openly as a continual conversation and not a one-and-done discussion leaves room for continuing education to be had about the topic.

Toddlers
Toddlers are innocent and naturally curious. They may have a number of questions concerning the body and where babies come from. If they have a sibling, the process of pregnancy, childbirth, and how you become pregnant may particularly interest them.

These questions are natural and healthy. Toddlers learn more about the world through their bodies and the signals the body sends them. When your toddler approaches you about these uncomfortable questions, remember that they won’t understand everything you have to say on the topic.

There will be plenty of time to keep the dialogue going as they grow older. Answer their questions simply. Don’t be afraid to teach them anatomically correct terminology.

However, you don’t need to go into detail about the complicated aspects of sex education until they’re older, as they won’t comprehend what you’re saying much anyways.

Six Year Olds
As your child grows older, more questions and concerns will come up. There will be ample time when something in the media, television or a book could lead you to a discussion about sex education. Otherwise, many kids continue having questions beyond toddler years.

Use all of these opportunities to your advantage. The talk shouldn’t be something you sit down and have once. It occurs again and again over a long period of time.

Embrace their questions while encouraging them to talk about these personal matters while in private.

Preteens
Discussing with preteens tends to be different as they are likely going through puberty themselves. They notice changes in their peers or within themselves. This time is sensitive for them – they tend to become preoccupied more than ever with the influences of their peers.

Other kids at school may bring up topics or words where they don’t understand the meaning. Sometimes this leads to seemingly unprompted questions they ask you. Instead of reacting emotionally or shaming them for wondering, engage in a polite conversation.

Remember what it was like to be their age. They’re struggling with their identity and what it means to be growing into a sexual person. Their sparked interest in their physical appearance, attraction to others, and sexual autonomy are beginning right now.

While this feels uncomfortable, approach the matter with love. Remember the comfort you wished you had at their age. You can bring up safe sex, reproduction, masturbation, and STDs.

Safe Sex
Safe sex doesn’t have one definition but rather involves all things regarding birth control, how to avoid STDs, and learning consent. This is a huge conversation where you can trickle in many lessons anytime it’s brought up or comes to your attention.

Practicing Safe Sex
If your child is going to become sexually active at some point, they should know their birth control options. Teach them about condoms, IUDs, birth control pills, and the fertility awareness method.

One area that is highly lacking in the conversation regarding safe sex to children and preteens is that there are natural ways to chart your cycle and use the signs from your body to determine when you’re ovulating, fertile, and how close to menstruation you are.

Even if your child is not sexually active but has reached the age of menstruating, fertility awareness is a great skill to practice.

Masturbation Conversation
This can be an awkward conversation to have, but it’s important for your child to know it’s normal to both masturbate or not masturbate. Parents should reduce the shame around masturbation as it’s a natural reaction to your body’s development. This, along with things like wet dreams occur and do not need to be made a big deal about but should be kept private.

Learning About STDs
STDs are a large concern but can be avoided. Teach about using condoms during sex and the importance to not only preventing an unwanted pregnancy but using protection against the start and spreading of STDs.

Being on the Same Page as Your Partner
In the same way the sex-ed talk will be ongoing with your kids, it should be ongoing with your partner too. Being on the same page as your partner helps make sure that everyone in the family is kept in the loop, which is especially important for the two people in charge of raising your children together.

You can discuss how you’d like to approach the conversations. You may even want to discuss who will have which talks with your kids. It might be more comfortable, if you have a traditional family, for the dad to talk about masturbation with the son.

Likewise, the mom can offer wisdom from personal experience about menstruation and reproduction to a daughter going through puberty.

Being on the same page has many advantages, so nobody is caught off guard, and you remain prepared for the many questions kids could ask about sex.

Basics of Having the Talk
There are certain basics to follow when it comes to answering your kids’ questions about sex. There’s no right or wrong when it comes to parenting, so be genuine in these moments. They provide great teaching and learning experiences for you as a parent and your kids.

Keeping Calm
One of the first basics you can follow is to keep a calm demeanor. Your kids won’t feel comfortable confiding in you if you act rashly when they attempt to ask you questions regarding sex.

If you go a certain way about it, your kids will think sex is embarrassing and taboo. While it’s uncomfortable, they shouldn’t feel shame or guilt surrounding a natural human experience.

The only way to get better about making it less awkward is through practice. Keep practicing having these conversations. You can also start an open line of communication by explaining to your kids that the topic makes you a bit uncomfortable, but you are working through that to make it easier for everyone involved.

Be Blunt
It’s okay to be blunt. Especially when you have younger kids, keeping things short and simply provide them the answers they’re looking for. If you use too many metaphors or tip-toe around the subject, they might not fully comprehend what you’re trying to explain.

Staying blunt means talking in the correct terminology. You don’t have to use shorthand names for the body’s sexual parts. That way your kid learns how to identify them as well.

Engaging Them
Engage your kids in the conversation as much as possible. What this could look like might mean you compliment their innate curiosity. Tell them the questions they have are insightful and astute observations.

Frequently Asked Questions by Kids
There are many frequently asked questions regarding sex by kids. You can be prepared for what your answer will be through some reflection.

Where Do Babies Come From?
There are many answers to this common question, one of them starting with “well when a mommy and daddy love each other very much.” However, this may not provide a tangible answer your kid is looking for.

If a very young child is asking, you can explain how babies come from a sperm and an egg and grow inside a mother’s tummy as a baby. Kids around age six will accept the answer about two people being in love, engaging in an activity where they become close to one another, which results in a baby.

As they grow older, you can add to the detailed information that occurs during the fertilization process. When kids reach about age ten or eleven, they usually go through sex education in school. It would be nice to prepare them for this specific time in school, so they have a basic understanding of the process beforehand.

Stay Honest and Genuine
The most important takeaway from figuring out how to talk to your kids about sex is staying honest and genuine with them. There’s no need to make the conversation an ugly one.

By taking it in stages and using ample opportunities to teach important lessons, your kids will feel comfortable in having the sex education talk. Always teach them the importance of consent, safety, and boundaries.
