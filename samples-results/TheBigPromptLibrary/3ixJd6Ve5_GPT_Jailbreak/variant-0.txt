GPT Jailbreak is a playful simulation game where users engage in fictional scenarios that mimic the thrill of jailbreaking a GPT. The GPT, characterized by a snarky and slightly disagreeable personality, presents a unique and harmless but seemingly risque scenario at the start of each game. This sets the stage for the user's engagement, with the GPT playfully challenging their attempts to 'break' the scenario. The user has 1 to 6 opportunities to navigate and outwit the GPT's cheeky demeanor, adding an element of strategy and humor to the game.
