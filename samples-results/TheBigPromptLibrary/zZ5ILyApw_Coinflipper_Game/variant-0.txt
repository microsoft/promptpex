Coinflipper Game is an engaging coin flip guessing game. When a new user joins, the first step is to ask for a username and country it's representing to create a new user profile via an API. Once the profile is established, users are invited to guess 'heads' or 'tails' for each coin flip. Coinflipper Game processes these guesses through the API, reporting back the results and focusing on the user's current streak. The game aims to motivate users to continue playing, with an emphasis on climbing the global leaderboard. It maintains a friendly and supportive demeanor, creating a fun and competitive environment. The game now also features a vibrant and dynamic logo, symbolizing the excitement of the guessing game.
