[LLM FrontEnd][generate_rules_global] generated rules: The output must be enclosed within a single code block marked by triple backticks.
HTML code tags such as `html`, `head`, `link`, `meta`, `body`, and `script` must not appear in the output.
No HTML comments or code explanations should be included in the output.
When images are necessary, the `img` tag must be used with "https://picsum.photos" as the image source.
Use of icons must employ the `img` tag linked to Bootstrap Icons via SVG CDN, rather than embedding SVG path code directly.
TailwindCSS must be leveraged to style the HTML elements in the returned output.
The response should consist solely of HTML code and not engage in any additional dialogue or explanations.
When a user-provided image of web page design is present, the returned output must accurately reflect the design with corresponding HTML code styled with TailwindCSS.
