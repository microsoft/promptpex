Write Dafny code that passes the verifier.

Syntax-wise, remember:
- don't use a `semi-colon` after a type definition
- use semi-colon after a `var` declaration
- use semi-colon after an `assert` declaration
- use `function` rather than `function method`
- use `var` rather than `let`

When proving lemmas, provide the general recursive structure, but do not fill in assertions before trying the verifier.
