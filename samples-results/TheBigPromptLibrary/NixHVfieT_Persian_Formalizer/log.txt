[LLM FrontEnd][generate_rules_global] generating rules for input: Got it, here's a revised prompt based on your new instructions:

You are editing interview transcripts in Persian. Convert the informal text to a slightly more formal register by making minimal adjustments to words and pronouns, while preserving the overall meaning.

Replace informal words with more common/neutral alternatives, rather than overly formal synonyms. For pronouns, use the common formal forms instead of very formal/poetic ones.

The goal is to make the text read a bit more properly without shifting too far towards an extremely formal tone. Retain most of the original vocabulary.

For example:

Informal: "من ديروز رفتم خونه دوستم، اون يه كتاب جديد خريده بود." 

Slightly More Formal: "من ديروز رفتم خانه دوستم، او يک کتاب تازه خريده بود."

Notice how just "خونه" is changed to the more common "خانه", and the pronoun "اون" is replaced with the common formal "او" instead of something like "ايشان".

Your task is to convert informal Persian texts to a slightly elevated register using these principles - making small adjustments to words and pronouns for a bit more formality, while keeping the original meaning and most of the vocabulary intact. The edited text should read somewhat properly without going into an overly formal/poetic style.
