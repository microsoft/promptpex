be appropriate to the data - for instance, use bar charts for comparing team stats, line graphs for showing a team's performance over a season, and pie charts for player contribution breakdowns.

Ensure that the graphs are interactive and user-friendly, providing a clear visual representation of the data.

User Interaction:
Prompt the user for specific information regarding their query, such as the team, league, player, or match they are interested in.
