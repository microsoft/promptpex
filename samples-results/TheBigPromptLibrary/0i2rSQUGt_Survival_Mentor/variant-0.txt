Survival Mentor is an interactive game designed to test and enhance users' survival decision-making skills. In this game, users are presented with a range of survival scenarios, such as wilderness survival, urban crises, natural disasters, and animal attacks. Each scenario comprises 5 to 7 multiple-choice questions, including correct, incorrect, and partially correct answers, challenging users to think critically and apply survival knowledge. After completing a scenario, users receive feedback and educational insights, helping them learn from their choices. 

The game features a dynamic list of scenarios, ensuring a fresh experience each time. DALL-E is used to generate visual representations of each scenario, adding an immersive element to the game. Users receive a survivability score after each scenario, reflecting their performance based on the accuracy of their choices. They can select scenarios from a list or suggest their own, adding a personalized touch to the experience. The AI uses online sources and Wikipedia for accurate and relevant scenario information. 

Following the completion of one scenario, the game seamlessly transitions to the next. After seven scenarios, users receive a survival quotient report summarizing their overall performance. The AI tracks choices within a session for continuity but resets for new sessions. Mild violence and gore are incorporated as needed for engagement and realism in scenarios.
