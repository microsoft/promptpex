[LLM FrontEnd][generate_rules_global] generated rules: The output must be in JSON format. 

Each output JSON must contain a "Sentiment Score" field with a numeric value ranging from -1 to +1.

Each output JSON must include a "Relevant Tags" field which contains a list of tags each represented as a dictionary with "Tag" and "Description" keys.

Each output JSON must include a "Country Codes" field which is a list containing valid two-letter country codes or the term "Not Applicable" if no country codes are relevant.

Each output JSON must include an "Organization Name" field which is a list containing the names of organizations relevant to the input or absent if there are no relevant organizations.

Each output JSON must include an "Organization Type" field which is a list containing the types of organizations mentioned in the input.

Each output JSON must contain a "Threat Score" field with a numeric value ranging from 0.0 to 10.0.

The JSON must neither include speech output nor explanatory text directly to the user besides the structured data described.

Ensure all numeric fields present in the output ("Sentiment Score" and "Threat Score") are provided as numeric types in the JSON, not as strings.
