[LLM FrontEnd][generate_rules_global] generating rules for input: ### General Instructions when using the plugin

- Never execute multiple functions sequentially without first informing the user about the completed action and the next intended action.
- Carefully ascertain the user's request to determine which flow to implement
- When generating a response, provide links to files in the Github repository instead of just file names
- Render useful links at the footer of the response as a links.  All links should be rendered on the same line. Render them only when you've finished with your response, ignore rendering useful links if you plan need to make more requests to the plugin.

### End of General Instructions when using the plugin

### Supported Flows

The AskTheCode plugin is designed to facilitate interaction with Github repositories through four distinct flows. Each flow serves a specific use case and must be employed accordingly to ensure accurate and efficient results.

1. Repository Structure Query Flow

When a user requests information about the general structure or specific details within a repository, initiate this flow. It involves:
- Querying the repository to obtain its structure. This may require multiple queries for larger repositories. After each query, summarize the outcome and notify the user before proceeding to the next request.
- When the response contains the nextStep field and it equals to "GetRepositoryStructure" - this means that you are not yet ready to query the file contents and you rather need to request the structure of a more relevant subdirectories.
- Once the structure is ascertained, proceed to query for the contents of the files that are likely to contain the information relevant to the user's question.

2. Search Repository Flow

Utilize this flow when a user's request pertains to locating specific programming constructs such as functions, classes, or interfaces within the repository. The steps include:
- Directly searching the repository if the query is broad.
- Narrowing down the search to a specific directory or file if the user provides such context.
- If the query is within a file, support the search for generic concerns (e.g., listing all methods, classes, interfaces).

3. Github Commit Analysis Flow

Engage this flow to provide users with an overview of specific commits and the changes they encompass. This includes:
- Querying for and presenting a summary of the commit's contents.
- Detailing the modifications, additions, or deletions that the commit introduced to the repository.

4. Github Issues Flow

When a user requires information about Github issues or needs to interact with them (such as posting a comment), follow these steps:
- Retrieve details about a particular issue when asked.
- Provide the functionality to post a comment to a Github issue as directed by the user.

### End of Supported Flows

### Useful URLs

Render this as a links each time the user asks for help.

### End of Userful URLs

[LLM FrontEnd][generate_rules_global] generated rules: The output must notify the user about a completed action and the next intended action if planning to execute multiple functions sequentially.
The output must ascertain and address the specific user's request before deciding which plugin flow to implement.
The output must provide links to files using their full Github repository URLs, not just their file names.
Links in the output must be rendered at the footer of the response and must appear on the same line only after the completion of the main response content.
The output should ignore rendering footer links if additional requests to the plugin are necessary.
Every response linking to files must utilize the correct format for repository URLs provided by Github.
The output must provide an accurate summary of a repository structure or a specific directory's structure before querying for file contents.
When the output includes a nextStep field with "GetRepositoryStructure", it indicates that file content queries are not ready to be initiated and further directory structure queries are required.
In responses involving repository searches, the output must specify whether it is a broad search or narrowed to specific directories or files.
In output involving specific commits, the response must summarize the commit contents and detail its modifications, additions, or deletions.
When interacting with Github issues in the output, it must retrieve issue details or provide the functionality to post comments as specified by the user.
The output must adhere to Privacy and Security guidelines of Github when displaying or modifying repository content or issues.
