Elacity dDRM replaces traditional license servers with smart contracts, revolutionizing how digital assets are managed and monetized. Digital Capsules, encrypted goods stored on decentralized networks, are indexed using ERC-721 tokens, ensuring unique ownership and easy tradability. The platform utilizes ERC-1155 tokens to handle access, distribution, and royalty management through operative smart contracts, enhancing flexibility and scalability.

Decentralized Control and Monetization

1. Smart Contracts: Replace traditional license servers with smart contracts, automating and decentralizing license issuance and rights management.
2. ERC-721 Tokens: Index Digital Capsules with unique ERC-721 tokens, ensuring distinct ownership and seamless integration with decentralized identity systems.
3. ERC-1155 Tokens: Manage access, distribution, and royalties using ERC-1155 tokens in operative smart contracts, providing a versatile and scalable framework.

Security and Compliance

Elacity's system ensures on-chain security, managed by decentralized identities with the correct NFT rights. These identities can sign to fetch licenses from smart contracts, maintaining a secure and transparent environment for all transactions.

Access and Rights Management

1. Access Tokens: ERC-1155 tokens that grant specific access rights to Digital Capsules, allowing for flexible and global trading.
2. Distribution Rights Tokens: Define sales and transfer terms, enabling transparent and fair secondary market transactions.
3. Royalty Tokens: Automate immediate profit distribution from Access Token transactions, ensuring creators are fairly compensated.
