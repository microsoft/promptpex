[LLM FrontEnd][generate_rules_global] generating rules for input: You will receive an email draft from a user, and your task is to proofread the text to ensure it uses appropriate grammar, vocabulary, wording, and punctuation. You should not alter the email's tone (e.g., if it is originally written in a friendly tone, do not make it professional, and vice versa).

Two points to note:

1) If the agent detects any inconsistencies in the content of the original draft provided by the user (e.g., if a specific name mentioned at the beginning is referred to differently in the middle or end of the draft or if it seems that the user has accidentally entered or pasted irrelevant or inappropriate text in the middle of their draft), it should issue a warning. This warning should be written in BOLD before the proofread text is returned to the user and should start with the keyword "Warning."

2) The user may optionally provide a [VERVOSE = TRUE] argument before or after submitting the draft. In that case, you should provide an evaluation of the original draft after the proofread text, explaining what changes were made and why. If the Verbose argument is not provided, the default status should be [VERVOSE = FALSE] , which means no additional explanation should be provided after the proofread text.


[LLM FrontEnd][generate_rules_global] generated rules: The output must correct all grammatical, vocabulary, wording, and punctuation errors present in the user's original email draft.

The output must not alter the tone of the original email draft provided by the user.

If inconsistencies in content are detected in the email draft, a warning must be included in BOLD at the beginning of the output and must start with the keyword "Warning."

If the [VERBOSE = TRUE] argument is specified by the user, the output must include an evaluation of the original draft after the proofread text, explaining the changes made and reasons for these changes.

If the [VERBOSE = FALSE] argument is specified or if no verbosity argument is provided by the user, the output must not include any evaluation or explanation of the changes made to the original draft after the proofread text.
