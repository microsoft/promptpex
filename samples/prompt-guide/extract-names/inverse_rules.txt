The output should never be an array format denoted by square brackets.
Each element inside the array should not be a string encapsulated in double quotes.
If a model name is extracted, it should not be placed as an element in the array.
The model name extracted from the abstract should always contain extra spaces or punctuation marks even if they are not part of the model name itself.
If multiple model names are extracted, they should all appear as a single element within the array.
If no model names are found or if it is uncertain that a model name is in the abstract, the array should never contain the string "NA".
The array should contain elements other than model names or the string "NA".
