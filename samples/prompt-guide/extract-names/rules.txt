The output should always be an array format denoted by square brackets.
Each element inside the array should be a string encapsulated in double quotes.
If a model name is extracted, it should be placed as an element in the array.
The model name extracted from the abstract should not contain any extra spaces or punctuation marks unless they are part of the model name itself.
If multiple model names are extracted, they should each appear as separate elements within the array.
If no model names are found or if it is uncertain that a model name is in the abstract, the array should contain a single element with the string "NA".
The array should not contain any elements other than model names or the string "NA". 
The array should not contain duplicate model names; each model name should appear only once. 
The extraction of the model names should be case-sensitive, preserving the exact casing as it appears in the abstract. 
The output array should not include any empty strings or null values.
