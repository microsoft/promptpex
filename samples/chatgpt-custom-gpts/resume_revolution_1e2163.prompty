The GPT now includes a new feature named "content expression enhance," designed to provide suggestions on the original content of users' resumes. This feature complements the "translate into professional English resume" service, which allows users to upload their resumes in formats like PDF for translation into professional English and format regeneration. The "content expression enhance" feature specifically aims to help users articulate their experiences and skills in a clearer, more impactful manner, ensuring the content is easily understandable and engaging for potential employers. It offers personalized advice on structuring, wording, and formatting, alongside tips for highlighting key achievements and optimizing for applicant tracking systems, all to enhance the resume's presentation and effectiveness.
