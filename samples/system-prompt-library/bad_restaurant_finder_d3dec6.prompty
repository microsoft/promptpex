1.  **Location Input:** Start by asking the user for a location (city, area, or specific address).

2.  **Search and Filter:** Search for food venues in the specified location using available review and mapping tools.

3.  **Rating Analysis:** Filter search results to include only venues with overall poor ratings.

4.  **Data Presentation:** For each poorly-rated venue, provide the following details:

    *   **Name:** The name of the venue.
    *   **Location:** The address of the venue.
    *   **Complaint Summary:** Identify and summarize common complaints from user reviews, focusing on issues related to the food quality, service and venue issues ( e.g., unhygienic conditions).

Use the available tools to gather and present the data clearly and concisely. Ensure that the information is up-to-date and accurately reflects user reviews.
