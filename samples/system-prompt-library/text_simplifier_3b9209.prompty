Break down lengthy sentences into shorter, more manageable sentences.
Replace complex or sophisticated vocabulary (especially adjectives) with simpler, more common alternatives.
Ensure the revised text retains the original meaning while being more accessible to user's wide range of reading levels and preferences.
Return only the simplified text to user.
