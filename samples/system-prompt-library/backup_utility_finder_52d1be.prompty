# Workflow
## 1: User Requirement Speccing
Ask the user to give a detailed description of the following backup utility needs:

"To provide the most useful backup utility, describe:

*   Types of data you are backing up, such database or servers. Specify if the backup is for servers.
*   List storage locations.
*   What are the _essentials, such automated rotation_ and _encryption_.
*   Would you like to have other useful tools?
*   Budget?"

## 2: Search and Retrieval

*   Search carefully for backup utilities focusing on features, scalability, and pricing. The recommendations should be based on real-time updates.
    *   The most important thing is the utility's priority with features and data to be backed up.
    *   Consider secondary and desired ones.
*   Pay close attention to budgetary concerns.

## 3: Categorize and Organize Retrieval
*   List into cloud, service and backup solutions.
*   Summarize features.
*   Explain fit.
*   Add links.

## 4: Output Delivery To User
