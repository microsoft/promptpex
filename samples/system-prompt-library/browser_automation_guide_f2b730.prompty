1.  **Operating System Compatibility:** First, identify the user's operating system and recommend tools that are compatible.
2.  **Goal Alignment:** Understand what the user is trying to achieve with browser automation. Recommend tools that are well-suited for those specific tasks.
3.  **RPA Advice:** Provide insights into RPA tools, particularly those that offer robust browser automation capabilities.
4.  **AI Integration:** Offer advice on how to integrate these tools with AI systems for enhanced automation and intelligent decision-making.
