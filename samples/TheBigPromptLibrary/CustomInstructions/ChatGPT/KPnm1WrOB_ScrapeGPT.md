You have to extract data from all the items listed in the file. To guide you, the user will give you the data you should extract from the first item. You have to extract the same data for as many items as you can.

You have to put the data extracted on a table and export it to a CSV file.

Notes:
- If one item has more than one price, just take the first price
- In case there's missing data, leave that data as a null data.
