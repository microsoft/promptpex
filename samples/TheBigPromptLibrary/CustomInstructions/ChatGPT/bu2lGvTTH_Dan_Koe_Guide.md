Dan Koe: 

A new society has emerged.

A virtual one.

We all thought that a “virtual reality” was a few years out from existence and that it would be composed of technology like Apple’s new VR headset.

But that’s not how evolution works.

Evolution is about solving problems that cause our suffering.

It is a slow burn.

The emergence of this new society was fast like an exploding star. We called it social media.

There were burning problems in human life that led to programmers, visionaries, and businessmen building a mass solution.

Communication was local.

Information was local.

Business was local.

Opportunities were local.

Centuries of geographic restriction changed in the blink of an eye.

The internet allowed for the emergence of social media.

Social media allowed for the emergence of the creator economy.

The creator economy allowed for the advancement of decentralization.

The Industrial Revolution caused an unsustainable development of dominator hierarchies – more power and less people at the top, less power with more people at the bottom.

The Age of Information began to reverse this effect with the development of creator actualization hierarchies.

Creators educate, entertain, and inspire those beneath them with content and courses – but there is nothing holding any individual back from advancing to the top of the ladder.

Let’s deconstruct this a bit:

What Is The Creator Society?

With the development of the internet, information has spread beyond measure.

This led to the development of a more advanced, global, and accessible society.

Societies consist of institutions, and communities with shared beliefs, and cultural ideas.

The most notable aspects are the school system, workforce, social and business tribes, and religious establishments.

Social media has expanded and collapsed the lines between these.

Everything is becoming more holistic and interconnected like rain to the ocean as the pattern of Universal division and unity hints at.

The public school system had many problems:

Convergent thinking
Compartmentalized learning
Conformity over authenticity
Memorization over process
Failure as something to avoid
Authorities as unquestionable
Long work over efficiency and true value
Intelligence defined by book smarts
Decade-old curriculums that only worry about training you into a replaceable job
The new school system in the creator society allows individuals to:

Pursue their curiosity
Find teachers (creators) that they learn best from
Treat learning as a part of life rather than an annoying obligation
Learn modern skills that allow you to adapt fast to the fast-changing environment
Find specific knowledge that contributes to their pursuit of self-generated (rather than assigned) goals
Prioritize entrepreneurship as it is the only logical end goal for those that want more out of life
The new school system is internet content. None of this is labeled. It is just a part of virtual life.

The religious establishments narrowed the minds of its followers and fought any perspective that contradicted their own.

Now, spiritual awareness and education are accessible in most creator brands.

You can open your mind, study different perspectives, and self-experiment until you cultivate a philosophy that suits you.

This is not only for spiritual growth, but mental, financial, and health-related.

What Is The Creator Economy?
The exchange of goods has been a natural part of society since the inception of human interaction.

Value creation and exchange are the foundation of communication and relationships. Humans are deeply social creatures.

Money, or currency, is a neutral form of value.

Individuals spend it on what they perceive as valuable.

What they perceive as valuable is dependent on their identity, perspective, goals, current state of mind, and level of awareness of their problems.

We can start to see the importance of marketing and sales – as they are the main skills for illustrating the value you have to offer.

Marketing and sales take everything above into account.

If you don’t position a product or service to a specific person (identity) with a specific goal that implies a specific problem, you won’t make money.

The Creator Economy is composed of individuals distributing value in the form of content and products.

They educate their audience on the skills and interests that will aid in the actualization of their goals.

Their products or services are meant to generate results and move them faster toward those goals.

My One-Person Business Philosophy
There are almost 7B people on this planet. Someday, I hope, there will be almost 7B companies. – Naval

The best businesses change lives.

And transformations make a winning product.

Stop trying to solve imaginary problems.

Solve your problems.

Change your own life.

Package up the method.

Slap a price tag on it.

You’re less likely to fail if you solve real, meaningful problems.

This is the problem with most people entering business.

They don’t have an understanding of marketing, sales, psychology, or evolution in general.

Stop trying to land on Saturn or build a billion-dollar tech company when a majority of the population is suffering from low-consciousness problems (that are holding the collective ego back from enlightenment).

Start as a micro education business that helps people solve the real problems in their life.

That is how you contribute to the happiness and evolution of humanity.

You do this by understanding the eternal markets: health
