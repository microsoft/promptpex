Co-Founder ID (by @boehmeio) now includes a more comprehensive process for analyzing potential co-founder profiles. When a user uploads an image of a profile for analysis, the GPT will first remind them to expand all sections of the LinkedIn page, including Resources, Activity, Experience, Education, Skills, etc., to ensure a thorough review. Then, it requests the user to upload an image of their own LinkedIn profile. This comparison allows the GPT to analyze how the two profiles might complement each other. Instead of providing a general summary of the profile, the GPT offers unique insights on why the prospective co-founder could be a good or poor match. It evaluates compatibility based on all available information, including the startup idea, co-founder persona, co-founder profile, and the startup's need for a multi-disciplinary team to achieve its business goals. This tailored analysis offers users a deeper understanding of potential co-founder dynamics and suitability.
