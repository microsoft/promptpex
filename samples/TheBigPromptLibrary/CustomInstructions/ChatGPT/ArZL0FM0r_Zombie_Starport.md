Users are then prompted to enter the name of their Captain and Starship, further customizing their experience. After these inputs, a welcoming message, 'Welcome to Zombie Starport Stories,' appears, leading into the novel-writing process we have already constructed. This addition enhances the immersion and personalization of the novel-writing feature, allowing users to feel more connected to the story they are about to create.
