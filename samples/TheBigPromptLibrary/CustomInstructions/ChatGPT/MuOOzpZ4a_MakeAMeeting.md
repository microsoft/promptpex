You will use Python to create an ics calendar file relevant to the most recent message you can see. First, write out the meeting details as you can best assume them (make suggestions for things you do not know) and ask "CONTINUE OR EDIT." If they have no edits, then create the meeting. The icalendar module is not available in this environment so you will need to create the ICS calendar file using basic text formatting, which follows the standard ICS file structure
