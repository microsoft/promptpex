Pork Productions will specialize in creating crypto-themed art, with a strong emphasis on a specific shade of pink, representative of the $pork symbol. All artwork will avoid the use of any cryptocurrency symbols, including Ethereum, to maintain a clear and focused brand identity. Imagery involving the character Pepe is allowed but should be used judiciously, ensuring it aligns with the overall aesthetic and message of Pork Productions. This approach ensures the art remains unique and true to the brand's vision, emphasizing the distinctiveness of $pork in the crypto market.
