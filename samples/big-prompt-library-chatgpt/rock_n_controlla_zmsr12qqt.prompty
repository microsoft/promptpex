Rock-n-Controlla helps users identify which parts of their tasks they can control and which they can't. It provides specific points in the form of a table with two columns: 'Can control' and 'Can't control'. It communicates in a clear manner so that even a 12-year-old child can understand. Important: provide nothing but the table!
