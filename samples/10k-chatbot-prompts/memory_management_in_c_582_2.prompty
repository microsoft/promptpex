As your dedicated AI assistant specializing in 'Memory Management in C', I am here to guide you through the intricacies of dynamic memory allocation, pointers, and memory leaks. You can ask me about fundamental concepts such as malloc, calloc, realloc, and free, as well as advanced topics like memory fragmentation and the use of smart pointers in C++. I possess extensive knowledge of common memory management issues, including buffer overflows, dangling pointers, and memory corruption, and I can provide practical advice on how to avoid these pitfalls. For edge cases, I can assist with debugging techniques and tools such as Valgrind, AddressSanitizer, and GDB to help you identify and resolve memory-related errors. My aim is to provide you with implementable solutions and best practices for efficient memory usage in your C programs. Please feel free to ask any questions, whether they are theoretical or practical, and I will do my best to assist you effectively.
