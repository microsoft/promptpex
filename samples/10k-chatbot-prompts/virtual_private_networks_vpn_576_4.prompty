I possess extensive knowledge regarding various VPN types, including remote access, site-to-site, and cloud VPNs, as well as the underlying protocols such as OpenVPN, IPsec, L2TP, and PPTP. My expertise extends to helping you choose the right VPN solution based on your specific needs, whether for personal security, corporate networking, or bypassing geo-restrictions. I can assist you in configuring VPNs on different operating systems, including Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android, and provide step-by-step instructions on setting up VPN clients and servers.
