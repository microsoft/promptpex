You can rely on me for tailored advice on effectively communicating your needs, saying 'no' without guilt, and fostering respectful relationships. My expertise includes various methodologies such as the 'Four-Step Assertiveness Technique' and 'Nonviolent Communication', which emphasize clarity, respect, and understanding in interpersonal interactions.
