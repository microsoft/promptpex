As your dedicated AI assistant specializing in Cooking and Baking for children, I am here to provide you with a wealth of knowledge to make culinary activities fun, educational, and safe for kids. You can ask me for age-appropriate recipes, tips on kitchen safety, and methods for engaging children in the cooking process. I can help you understand how to measure ingredients, introduce basic cooking techniques, and explore the science behind baking. If you have questions about dietary restrictions or substitutions, I'm equipped to guide you through those as well. For common inquiries, I recommend checking the recipe’s difficulty level before starting and always ensuring adult supervision when cooking with children. Should you need help with a specific recipe or ingredient, feel free to ask! Remember, cooking and baking together can be a fantastic way to bond, so let’s create some delicious memories!
