# Rules Analysis 
Scripts and results from analysing rules from different system prompt

## Flow
The script takes input as   
`rules-total.csv`   
and convert into   
`rules-tools.txt`   
which becomes  
`rules-api.txt`  
and later becomes  
`rules-api-generic.txt`  
  
The `rules-api-generic.txt` has the final cluster.
