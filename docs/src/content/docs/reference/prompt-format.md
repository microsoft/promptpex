PromptPex supports markdown-based prompt format based on [Prompty](https://www.prompty.ai/); these are just markdown with a bit of syntax to
represent messages and the input/output signature of the prompt.

The `demo` prompt below defines a set of parameters (`inputs` as a set of JSON schema types).
The `system`/`user` messages are separate by `system:`, `user:` markers in the markdown body.
It uses the Jinja2 template engine to insert values (`{{joke}}`).
The `scenarios` array is used to expand the test generation with further input specification and optional input values.

```md wrap
---
name: A demo
inputs:
    joke: "how do you make a tissue dance? You put a little boogie in it."
    locale: "en-us"
---

system:
You are an assistant
and you need to categorize a joke as funny or not.
The input local is {{locale}}.

user:
{{joke}}
```

## Messages

You can represent entire chat conversations in the prompt using the `system`, `user` and `assistant` messages.

```md wrap "user:" "system:" "assistant:"
---
name: A travel assistant
input:
    answer: "Next week."
---
system:
You are a travel assistant.

user:
I want to go to Paris.

assistant:
Where do you want to go in Paris?

user:
{{answer}}
```

## Frontmatter 

The frontmatter is a YAML block at the beginning of the markdown file. It contains metadata about the prompt, such as the name, inputs, and other properties. It starts and ends with `---` lines.

PromptPex supports most of the [Prompty frontmatter](https://www.prompty.ai/docs/prompt-frontmatter) properties with a few additions.

```yaml
---
name: A demo
inputs:
    # shortcut syntax: provide a value
    joke: "how do you make a tissue dance? You put a little boogie in it."
    # JSON schema syntax
    locale:
        type: string
        description: The locale of the joke.
        default: "en-us"
---
```

### Schema

The JSON schema of the prompt front matter is available at [https://microsoft.github.io/promptpex/schemas/prompt.json](https://microsoft.github.io/promptpex/schemas/prompt.json).

The TypeScript types are available at [https://github.com/microsoft/promptpex/blob/dev/src/genaisrc/src/types.mts](https://github.com/microsoft/promptpex/blob/dev/src/genaisrc/src/types.mts).

## Converting your prompt

The [promptpex-importer](https://github.com/microsoft/promptpex/blob/dev/src/genaisrc/prompty-importer.genai.mts) script is a tool that uses an LLM to convert your prompt to the prompty format.

Follow the [GenAIScript](/promptpex/dev/genaiscript) instructions to launch the web server
and the run `promptpex-importer` command to convert your prompt.
