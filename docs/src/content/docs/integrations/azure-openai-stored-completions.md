[Azure OpenAI Stored Completions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/stored-completions)
is a feature that allows you to store the completions generated by the OpenAI API. This can be useful for various purposes,
such as evaluating the performance of the model, training new models, or simply keeping a record of the generated text.

## Metadata

When PromptPex uploads the test results, it attaches metadata to allow filtering of the tests:

- `runId`: a unique identifier for the run.
- `testId`: a unique identifier for the test.
- `scenario`: the scenario name.
- `dataset`: `training` or `test` to allow for different sets to be used
- `prompt`: the name of the prompt

## Parameters

- `storedCompletions`: enables the stored completion feature.
- `storeModel`: the model to use for storing completions. This is a string that specifies the model name. The default value is the `store` model alias which resolves to `large` alias.
