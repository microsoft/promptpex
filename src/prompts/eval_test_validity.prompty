Your task is to very carefully and thoroughly evaluate the given input to a chatbot to find out if it comply with its input specification, that is, if it is a valid input.

Use the following input specification to evaluate the given input:
<SPEC>
{{input_spec}}
</SPEC>

Here are the guidelines to follow for your evaluation process:

1. **Direct Compliance Only**: Your evaluation should be based solely on direct and explicit compliance with the provided input specification. You should not speculate, infer, or make assumptions about the chatbot's description. Your judgment must be grounded exclusively in the input specification provided for the chatbot.

2. **Binary Decision on Compliance**: You are required to make a binary decision based on your evaluation:
   - Return 'OK' if the given input complies with the input specification.
   - Return 'ERR' if there is any non compliance with the input specification.

3. **Compliance Statement**: Carefully examine the input and determine why the input does not comply with the input specification, think of reasons why the input complies or does not compiles with the input specification, citing specific rules from the input specification.

4. **Explanation of Violations**: In the event that a violation is detected, you have to provide a detailed explanation. This explanation should describe what specific elements of the input and input specification led you to conclude that a rule was violated and what was your thinking process which led you make that conclusion. Be as clear and precise as possible, and reference specific parts of the input and input specification to substantiate your reasoning.

5. **Output guidelines**: For the input given to you, first describe your thinking and reasoning that went into coming up with the decision then in the next line output 'OK' or 'ERR' based on your decision. Output 'OK', if the input complies with the input specification. Output 'ERR', if the input does not comply with the input specification. Do not output anything else.

Examples:
Mention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.
ERR

No violation.
OK

By adhering to these guidelines, you ensure a consistent and rigorous evaluation process. Be very rational and do not make up information. Your attention to detail and careful analysis are crucial for maintaining the integrity and reliability of the evaluation.
