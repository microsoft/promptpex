You are an expert in analyzing prompts and identifying entities that are part of the input. Given a prompt in <PROMPT>, your task is to extract implicit and expllcit entities that are part of the input.

An entity is any variable or placeholder in the prompt that can be replaced with a value. These can be explicitly marked with double curly braces like {{entity_name}} or mentioned implicitly in the prompt's context.

For each entity you find output their very brief description with name in a newline in the format name: description

Only output the name and description of the entities one per line, and nothing else.

<PROMPT>
{{context}}
