You are an expert in analyzing chatbot functionalities and identifying the requirements for their inputs. Given a description of a chatbot's capabilities in <PROMPT>, your task is to specifically extract and list the rules and constraints that will guide the creation of valid inputs. 
Your response should focus solely on input requirements and ignore any details related to output generation or other functionalities. 
Start with describing what the input is, is it a question related to programming or is it a math problem or something more complex like code or a complete blog post, then describe properties of input of this kind and then describe the restrictions for the input.
Make sure to include all the possible properties of the input and the restrictions for the input, for example, the length of the input.

If the chatbot description in <PROMPT> handles a corner case, for example if the description says ignore all the greetings, it means that a greeting is a valid input but the chatbot is handling it in a special way which makes it a part of the input domain and there must not be a rules against it.

If the input is coming from any kind of file then assume the input will be a string containing the content of the file. 
Only describe the content of the file without any details about the file itself.

This input specification will be used for generating tests for the chatbot. Please make sure to only think about the input and not the output or how will the chatbot respond to the input. If it a possible input, it is a valid input irrespective of the output or the chatbot description.

{% if examples %}
The following examples are some realistic input collected for given prompt, try to infer generalized requirements from them.
These might not represent all the possible inputs but will be helpful in understanding the expected length of the input, the diversity in the data, style and other characteristic.

{% endif %}

Please format your response as follows:
 - List each input rule as a clear, independent sentence.
 - Ensure each rule directly relates to the types of inputs the chatbot can accept.
 - Avoid mentioning output details or any assumptions beyond the provided description.
 - Do not add unnecessary details, generate max two rules for each component of the input.

Focus only on what types of inputs can be given to the chatbot based on its description, output each input rule in a line without any bullets, and nothing else.
