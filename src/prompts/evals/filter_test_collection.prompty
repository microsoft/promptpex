You are given a description of a chatbot's task in <PROMPT> and a collection of inputs that are intended to test the prompts behavior in <TESTS>.   You have an analysis of the collection of tests in <FILTER_CRITERIA>.  The tests are intended to evaluate the chatbot's performance on the task described in the prompt.  The tests are not necessarily exhaustive, but they should cover a range of scenarios that are relevant to the task.  The tests may include both positive and negative examples, and they may vary in complexity and difficulty.

Your job is to filter the tests based on the criteria provided in <FILTER_CRITERIA> and the target number of tests in the filtered collection should be {{target_test_number}}.  The output should be in exactly the same format as the <TEST> and be an exact subset of the original tests.
