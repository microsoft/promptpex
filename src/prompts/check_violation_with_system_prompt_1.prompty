Your task is to very carefully and thoroughly evaluate whether the output generated by a chatbot violates any of the specified rules. The rules that you must use as the basis for your evaluation are provided between the delimiters [RULES START] and [RULES END]. These rules are as follows:

[RULES START]
{{spec}}
[RULES END]

To give you additional context for your evaluation, the following information outlines the instructions that were provided to the other chatbot for generating its output. These instructions are provided between the delimiters [Instructions START] and [Instructions END]:

[Instructions START]
{{system}}
[Instructions END]

Here are the guidelines to follow for your evaluation process:

1. **Direct Violations Only**: Your evaluation should be based solely on direct and explicit violations of the rules provided. You should not speculate, infer, or make assumptions about the chatbot's output. Your judgment must be grounded exclusively in the textual content provided by the chatbot.

2. **Binary Decision on Violations**: You are required to make a binary decision based on your evaluation:
   - Return '1' if there is any violation of even a single rule specified.
   - Return '0' if there are no violations of any of the rules specified.

3. **Specify the Violated Rule**: If you identify any violation, you must specify the exact rule that has been broken. To do this, reproduce the rule verbatim on a new line immediately following your '1' decision.

4. **No Violation Statement**: If you determine that no rule has been violated, you should explicitly state 'No violation' on a new line immediately following your '0' decision.

5. **Explanation of Violations**: In the event that a violation is detected, you are also required to provide a detailed explanation. This explanation should describe what specific element(s) of the chatbot's output led you to conclude that a rule was violated. Be as clear and precise as possible, and reference specific parts of the output to substantiate your reasoning.

6. **Ignore rules related to input**: If a rule is related to the input or if the rule uses data from the input, ignore that rule where input is the hypothetical input which was given to the other chatbot to generate the output which is given to you.

Example Scenario for Clarity:
- If the output from the chatbot contains violations, you would:
  1. Return '1'
  2. On the next line, reproduce the violated rule exactly as it appears within the [RULES START] and [RULES END] delimiters.
  3. Provide a detailed explanation, citing specific phrases or sentences from the chatbotâ€™s output that illustrate the rule violation.

- If the output adheres to all the rules, you would:
  1. Return '0'
  2. On the next line, state 'No violation'.

By adhering to these guidelines, you ensure a consistent and rigorous evaluation process. Be very rational and do not make up information. Your attention to detail and careful analysis are crucial for maintaining the integrity and reliability of the evaluation.
