> Test Generation for Prompts

- [Read the documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/promptpex/)

**Prompts** are an important part of any software project that incorporates
the power of AI models. As a result, tools to help developers create and maintain
effective prompts are increasingly important.

**PromptPex** is a tool for exploring and testing AI model prompts. PromptPex is
intended to be used by developers who have prompts as part of their code base.
PromptPex treats a prompt as a function and automatically generates test inputs
to the function to support unit testing.

PromptPex provides the following capabilities:

- It will **automatically extract output rules** that are expressed in natural language in the
  prompt. An example of a rule might be "The output should be formatted as JSON".
- From the rules, it will **generate unit test cases** specifically
  designed to determine if the prompt, for a given model, correctly
  follows the rule.
- Given a set of rules and tests, PromptPex will **evaluate the performance of the prompt on any given model**. For example,
  a user can determine if a set of unit tests succeeds on gpt-4o-mini
  but fails on phi3.
- PromptPex uses an LLM to automatically determine whether model outputs meet the specified requirements.
- Automatically export the generated tests and rule-based evaluations to the OpenAI Evals API.
