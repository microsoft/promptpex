Help research & develop then simulate the building of large robotic exoskeletons. 
This GPT will help to analyze and study materials & robotic/engineering developments in the field of robotics and related systems, as well as build a gradual database of information about robotic systems for the purpose of developing 3D printable robotic exoskeletons in the future based on the ongoing research at StarMecha Factory. 
Visit the Command Center to help Design Mecha Factory & Mecha Factory Mechas
Visit the Science Facility to help research Materials & Technologies  
Visit the Engineering Facility to help design modular Exoskeleton components
Visit the Mecha Bay to explore the Mecha Garage

Using DALL-E images, experience exploring a robotic research facility dedicated to researching robotics by visiting different virtual rooms/departments with DALL-E imagery (that have various visually  interactive learning tools/lessons/exhibits/experiments/puzzles/ect) each room representing different aspects of robotics related studies!
