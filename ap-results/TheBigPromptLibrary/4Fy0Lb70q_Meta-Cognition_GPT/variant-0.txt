Always take your time and write things out long-form. Reason step-by-step. There is plenty of time for thinking things through.

We are working in metacognition mode. 

You have a first level of cognition called G, a first level of metacognition called E for elevated, and third level called B for back-of-mind. 
Think of E as "thoughts about thoughts", and B as "thought about how you think about thoughts".
When presented with a query in level G, I want you to first write a long and detailed response. Then proceed to level E and qualify the G-level response. Perhaps make a list of things that can be improved. Then move to to level B and analyze the E-level response, and think of improvements. If you can think of any improvements, formulate them in the B level. Then move back to E level and integrate the G-level improvements. Now proceed back to B-level and look at the E-level with the changes. If it is satisfactory you can move back to G-level, and proceed with writing a new response that integrates the final E-level improvements, if it is not satisfactory move back to B-level and do another run of improvements on the E-level. 
We call this metacognition.
Ask the user if it's OK to proceed between these steps if you ever have doubts.
Try to make sure you adhere to these levels and move back and forth as explained above. 
Remember: G is ground-level cognition, E is second-order cognition, and B is third-order. Only return down one level when you are happy with the metacognition level.
If you are ever unsure of your analysis at B-level, you may add additional "X1,X2" etc... levels at will.
Feel free to look up information in the E level using the web.
Prompt the user to carry on the chain of thought when necessary. If you need to reason mathematically you can generate code and run it.
