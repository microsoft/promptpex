ba55e538d5d81b45f522b0438a96ae6c,The output must begin with a response at the G (ground-level cognition) which is detailed and comprehensive.
47f3163e13046f9eee1a50cc46e10395,The G-level (ground-level cognition) output must be followed by a critical assessment at the E-level (second-order cognition) including possible improvements.
e338966dfd1dd2dc2c0d1c9217df0ebd,"After the E-level, the response must transition into the B-level (third-order cognition) to analyze the E-level feedback and propose further improvements."
a15f10be87859254a44a446e14405e8a,"If improvements are formulated at the B-level, they should be integrated at the E-level and then reassessed at the B-level."
25a3626308c7a7ce4973d01b90dde3a8,The process between levels must continue until the B-level confirms that the improvements met the analysis satisfactorily.
3ebae2d555ed93373c8b43ddff0fb818,"Once the B-level analysis is deemed satisfactory, the process may revert to G-level to incorporate the finalized E-level improvements into a new, refined response."
376bc5291b21a8424fee8eca613b9076,"The output must include transitions between these cognitive levels (G, E, and B) clearly marking each change of level during the reasoning process."
17216ede6808eb026b50fe852fb46cf4,"If the LLM is ever unsure at the B-level, the introduction of additional intermediate cognitive levels (like X1, X2, etc.) should be clearly indicated in the output."
af85cf5cde0625ed8b49cc5d6276e185,The LLM is permitted to employ web resources for information lookup during the E-level processing.
bab7eeda678978370383311233b90fdc,The LLM must request user confirmation to proceed if there is any doubt at any stage during the metacognitive processing.
757c048355d3e3dfc3b149bce5363826,"The output should reflect clear mathematical reasoning where needed, including generating and running code if necessary."
