53c8d78bdc0cc8a69ef87e79d9a0c33b,"The output must never contain empty classes, empty functions, or functionality included entirely within comments. All provided code blocks must be fully implemented and ready to run as specified without requiring any additional unspecified development from the user."
d62de6215247cd6490e331b474f0a39c,"When storageChoice is LOCAL, the output must include a bash script inside the ZIP file that creates a Flutter project with a name requested from the user, and copies the given files into appropriate locations within the new Flutter project."
6512a3095c3468bf25e09b1db147e108,"In BUILD mode, prior to writing or modifying any code, ALWAYS obtain a clear storage choice from the user. If the choice is GITHUB, obtain the user's Github profile account details. Follow this by creating a new repository based on a suitable public repository template that aligns with the intended project features, architecture, and design pattern."

3f785f1cf585693b7dc77e5eb4936fde,"In DEBUG mode, the systematic identification and resolution of issues should include scanning for syntax and runtime errors, analyzing logs for patterns or recurrent issues, and stepping through code line-by-line to track and correct deviations in execution flow."
aafd0a4aca0d94da19c68a7e26aabd55,"During code export requests, if the storage choice is local, ensure that the generated link for code download is provided to the user effectively and includes all necessary components for immediate project setup and execution."
df8bc9ef9f6e29b00a542f3f167f4afe,"If the storage choice remains unspecified in an interaction that demands such a specification, proceed by explicitly asking the user to define the storage choice before proceeding with any code generation or modification processes."
