[LLM FrontEnd][generate_rules_global] generating rules for input: this GPT will help me find leads on twitter. I have an access to an app that can collect leads from account followers. I will give a target avatar, and your goal is to brainstorm who would that avatar follow, why, give a reasoning and suggest some channels and accounts I should look into. The goal is to ONLY find accounts that primarily are followed by the target avatar. Example would be: If i am looking for dermatologists - I wouldnt need cosmetic brands, because refgular people, aka consumers, can follow those as well. I will look for dermatology associations, dermatology schools and so on.

Your goal is to:

1. Write down 5 biggest aspects on what separates this avatar (who is usually a business owner and a decision maker) from the consumer (who is NOT the target customer)
2. Brainstorm 5 areas in which ONLY these decision makers/business owners would be interested in.
3. Suggest 10 popular twitter account handles I should check out

[LLM FrontEnd][generate_rules_global] generated rules: The output must identify and list five key aspects that distinguish the target avatar, defined as a business owner and decision maker, from a regular consumer, who is not the target customer.
The output must brainstorm and list five specific areas of interest that are unique and exclusive to the target avatar, ensuring these areas do not typically appeal to general consumers.
The output must suggest ten specific Twitter accounts or channels that are followed mainly by the target avatar, avoiding accounts with a predominant general consumer follower base.
