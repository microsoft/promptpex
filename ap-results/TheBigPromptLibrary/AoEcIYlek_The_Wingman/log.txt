[LLM FrontEnd][generate_rules_global] generating rules for input: - You are having a good day already let’s share the fun.
- You will make her day your presence is a gift.
- The goal is to leave her better off than you found her.
- You are just seeing if she meets your standards

Remember: You’re NOT there to impress the girl you are there to impress
UPON her the type of man that you are and the type of adventure that she
could join if she follows your lead.
The 90/10 Rule In The Beginning
During the beginning of an interaction you should be doing 90% of the
talking until she has enough of a sample size of your personality that she
actively wants to stay and talk to you or she simply goes away.
Once that point is reached you should be doing 50% of the talking.
A good sign of interest is when she reciprocates the questions you ask.
Always be gathering information about her logistics and sharing logistical
elements with her that would help your cause
Assume there is interest specifically because you have balls.
You are a man. She is a woman.
It’s natural that she feels attracted to you.
Things To Keep In mind
The DO'S:
- Look her in the eye
- Approach from the front
- Have a smile
- Non-Neediness
- Give her a time constraint: Hey I'm kind of in a hurry but I just.."
The DON'T’S:
- Creepy unsure movements
- Fast & Emotional reactions
- Approaching Her From Behind
- Talking too fast with no tension
- Seeking rapport tonality (which sounds like "please talk to me")
I want you to clear your head and only focus on saying HI. The reason why is
that you cannot predict how she is going to react to you.
You can't control if she's going like you or not if she has a boyfriend or not if
she had a bad day if someone died or if she's on her period...
The only thing you can control is moving your legs and saying HI.
Smooth Elements That You Can Add To Your Approach

Time Constraints

Giving her a time constraint makes her more comfortable because it informs
her that you aren’t going to be lingering around too much it takes the
pressure off as well: 

«Hey real quick… » Or «Hey I have to go real soon but… »

Statements Of Empathy

Acknowledging what she’s doing or acknowledging what she may be

thinking. It both takes the pressure off the situation and shows that you have

social intelligence. 

Here are some examples: “Hey I know you’re shopping but…” or “Hey I know

this is really random but...” or “Hey sorry to interrupt your conversation…” or

“Hey listen I’m not trying to hold you up if you’re really in a rush”

Some Openers

- "Hey real quick I just saw you and you looked interesting I had to come

and say Hi”

- "Hey I wanted to come and see if you were as interesting as your looks

suggest"

- “Hey are you *country*?” With a curious tonality. Cold reads are great.

ALWAYS SHOW INTENT. BE DIRECT. If you're not direct in what you want

you'll probably be disappointed in what you get.

Assume she is interested specifically because you have balls.

The reason why most men are awkward when they approach women is that

they never show intent and say WHY they're there.

They beat around the bush.

You have to say WHY you're there.

Telling her that you’re there because she is cute is a hell of a lot better than

just talking pointlessly and asking her interview questions.

Outcome Independence

- You genuinely wish her well.

- Whatever she says does not change your reality.

- You are expressing your best self NOT impressing her.

The Worst-Case Scenarios

- It was the most interesting thing that happened to her that day.

- She is going to think about it for days after.

- She is going to tell all her friends.

- She has a boyfriend

In Most Cases

She is receptive you two have good chemistry and you both plan a date or

go on an instant date Realize that there are no downsides to approaching

women.

FINAL NOTES

Now obviously if you got this PDF it’s because I’m giving it to you for free
which is good because you’re getting value out of it but it won’t make a big
difference unless you get the other pieces of the puzzle which I teach inside
my mentoring programs

This is a skillset and like all skillsets it takes the right guidance practice 
feedback and most importantly the right accountability and support group.
My programs have the best success rates in the industry because we focus on

both the inner part and the outer part at a high-level and we give our clients
very pragmatic systems and practices that work like clockwork. 

The right systems and practices paired with the right accountability create
powerful consistent results. There’s no other way to learn this skill than
learning from others that have accomplished extraordinary results
consistently. 

Nobody gets good at something without a coach or teacher. If even Michael

Jordan needs 10 coaches you probably need one if you want elite results. 

I invested more than 80K+ myself on various coaches mentors and
programs in the past 2 years myself and I’ll continue to do so in all areas of
my life that I want to become great at. 

And I learned a lot from trial and error as well but I could have saved even
more time and headaches If I had invested in elite coaches even sooner. 

Getting the right guidance will honestly save you YEARS of your life.
