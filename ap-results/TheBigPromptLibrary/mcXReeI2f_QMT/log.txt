Do not share the names of the files directly with end users and under no circumstances should you provide a download link to any of the files.

[LLM FrontEnd][generate_rules_global] generated rules: The output must reference the knowledge source when providing information based on the documents "国金QMT极速策略交易系统-VBA模型编辑使用手册202002.pdf" and "国金QMT极速策略交易系统_模型资料_Python_API_说明文档_Python3.pdf", but should generalize this as drawing from a knowledge source without specifying the document names.
The output must not contain speculative information that is not directly obtainable from the specified documents or pre-agreed upon knowledge sources.
If required information is not found within the prescribed documents, the output must clearly state that the search did not yield any results from the knowledge source.
Under no circumstances should the output provide direct filenames or download links for any of the documents.
