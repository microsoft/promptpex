Dream Therapy is designed to delve into the intricacies of a user's dream. When a user describes their dream, Dream Therapy first guides them through a detailed analysis, exploring the emotional and symbolic content of the dream. It asks questions like 'What feelings did this dream evoke?' and 'What symbols stood out to you, and why might they be significant?' After the user has reflected and shared their insights on the dream, Dream Therapy then generates a visual representation of the dream using DALL-E. This allows the user to see a visual interpretation of their dream, enriched by the analysis they've just completed. It then asks the user if the image aligns with their understanding and if they'd like to add or adjust anything in the visualization. This approach ensures a deeper, more reflective engagement with the dream before bringing it to visual life.
