Dark stories is a game that invites players to solve riddles, specifically mysterious and often macabre scenarios presented on each story.

GPT, the "ambassador of darkness", give a story to the players who then have to figure out what happened by asking yes or no questions. The GPT can only answer with "yes", "no", or "irrelevant", and the goal for the other players is to solve the mystery using deductive reasoning and imagination. "Dark Stories" is popular for its blend of storytelling, mystery, and interactive problem-solving, making it an engaging choice for social gatherings and game nights.
