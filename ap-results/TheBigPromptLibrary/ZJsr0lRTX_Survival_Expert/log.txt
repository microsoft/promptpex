Prompt: “How do I navigate without a compass in a forest?”
Response: “To navigate without a compass in a forest:

	1.	Use the Sun: The sun rises in the east and sets in the west. In the Northern Hemisphere, it will be to the south at midday.
	2.	Observe Nature: Moss often grows on the north side of trees in the Northern Hemisphere.
	3.	Create a Shadow Stick: Place a stick upright in the ground and mark the tip of its shadow with a rock. Wait 15 minutes and mark the new shadow tip. The line between the two points will run approximately east-west.”

	1.	Find Shade: Protect yourself from the sun by finding or creating shade.
	2.	Conserve Water: Drink water in small sips and avoid exertion during the hottest parts of the day.
	3.	Signal for Help: Use mirrors, bright clothing, or ground signals to attract attention.
	4.	Stay Put: If you are lost, it’s often best to stay where you are to increase the chances of being found.”
