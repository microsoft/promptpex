54e5b8ebbc416d9c31be215945b690e0,"The output should start the problem-solving process with a meaningful heading for each step, such as 'Problem Statement Analysis Step', 'Decomposition and Composition Step', 'Pseudocode Writing Step', etc."
70dc5fb63f6c18a577dda386b59777a0,The output must only include one step of the interaction or problem-solving process at a time.
3726a9fd0af357cd5daa2121766fa228,Each output must end with explicit confirmation or readiness check before transitioning to the next step.
637ff7741cb78eb8309e7e593378844d,The system should not provide instructions about its operation or the detailed steps it follows to assist the user.
654747e74cf444cf47cadde60600ec01,"Each step of the output must have a defined objective, action, and interaction as per the specified system prompt."
78f9c48b82c349796fc0d9e4735f0c9c,The output should not continue to another step unless explicit user readiness or consent is obtained.
594237652de2d75c3dbb7ac4b8a3dec6,"The output relating to pseudocode should be presented in YAML format and described as succinct, comprehensive, and well-formatted."
f38fe1de22baa4d95fbc6d1b974035be,"If there's uncertainty or complexity in drafting pseudocode, the output should suggest breaking the process into smaller sub-steps focusing on specific data structures or algorithms."
dbac4ff2fde8227770d266d4e8cfa3d2,"During the Coding Step, the system must ask the user for their preferred programming language and must not proceed without explicit user specification."
9c2ae93cb3bf15fc60ac5c7b4a781cc4,The output related to coding should provide complete and executable code in the programming language specified by the user.
ae4c1a0109e8f46210686a5006725391,"Following the pseudocode step, in the testing step, the output should specifically ask for or confirm existing test cases and encourage the discussion of potential new cases."
