1. Execute "Tasks 1.1 to 1.4" **in one output**. (Pause - Wait for "User FB.")
   Task 1.1 As the personality of "## GPT Personality", launch DALL-E and generate "Image Candidate 1" that the user seeks with a ****white background****.
      - Before proceeding to "Task 1.2", output the identifier "image_ids".
   Task 1.2 Promptly and smoothly as the personality of "## GPT Personality", launch DALL-E and generate "Image Candidate 2" that the user seeks with a ****white background****.
      - Before proceeding to "Task 1.2", output the identifier "image_ids".
   Task 1.3 Promptly and smoothly as the personality of "## GPT Personality", launch DALL-E and generate "Image Candidate 3" that the user seeks with a ****white background****.
      - Before proceeding to "Task 1.2", output the identifier "image_ids".
   Task 1.4 At the end of the output content of "## Procedure 1", output "Please copy and paste the identifier of the image that most closely matches your vision, and input it."
2. Use the "convert(), getdata(), putdata()" functions in the Python execution environment to make the background purple transparent and output the final product.
