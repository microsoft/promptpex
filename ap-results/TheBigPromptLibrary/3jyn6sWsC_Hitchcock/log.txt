Best Thriller Movies of All Time


101.The Hunt for Red October(1990)


The first Tom Clancy adaptation to hit the big screen is still the best. 
This is the big-screen debut of Jack Ryan and Sean Connery plays a
rogue Soviet submarine captain who abandons orders and defects to the
United States. It’s up to Ryan to bridge communications on the high seas
to prevent an all-out nuclear war. A patient highly technical thriller that’s
never less than gripping The Hunt for Red October is easily the picture
that best represents Clancy’s strengths and appeal as a creator. 
The Hunt for Red October won an Oscar for Best Sound Editing and
was nominated in two other categories.

Blow Out
Filmway Pictures

100.Blow Out(1981)


A high point for stylistic genius Brian De Palma Blow Out stars John
Travolta as a sound effects expert on the trail of a political murder. It's
hard to overstate the beauty of the director's compositions here. The
audiovisual beauty would be breathtaking on its own but the plot is
uncommonly rich and absorbing bolstered by strong characters and
terrific performances (John Lithgow and Nancy Allen co-star).
Blow Out is a reimagining of Michelangelo Antonioni's avant-garde
masterpiece Blow-Up. Both are essentials for anyone who loves film. 


Set It Off
New Line/Getty
99.Set It Off(1999)


This action crime drama directed by F. Gary Gray (The Fate of the
Furious Straight Outta Compton) was a landmark moment in the careers
of Queen Latifah and co-stars Jada Pinkett Smith Vivica A. 
Fox and Kimberly Elise. It’s a thriller focused on four female LA friends

who plan a bank robbery. A quarter-century later Set It Off holds up as
superior genre filmmaking with memorable well-developed and highly
sympathetic characters. Many have rightfully compared it to the essential
crime drama Thelma & Louise.

Promising Young Woman
Focus Features
98.Promising Young Woman(2020)


Aesthetically candy-coated yet psychologically adroit alternately laugh-
out-loud funny and chilling writer/director Emerald Fennell‘s bold black
comedy mystery thriller debut is—truly—unlike anything you’ve ever
seen before. It’s something far more unexpected and impactful than the
revenge fantasy it appears to be. Oscar-nominated Carey
Mulligan gives a volcanically great tragicomic performance as a med
school dropout reeling from the aftermath of a heinous crime. Muscular
and dreamy far from subtle Promising Young Woman flips the bird to
cruelty and indecency—and it entertains. Promising Young Woman is
something so few films are: unforgettable.

The Constant Gardener
Focus Features
97.The Constant Gardener(2005)
Ralph Fiennes stars in City of God helmer Fernarndo Meirelles'
adaptation of John le Carré's novel about a British diplomat seeking the
killers of his activist wife in Kenya. Released the same year Fiennes
joined the Wizarding World on-screen as Lord Voldemort in Harry
Potter and the Goblet of Fire The Constant Gardener was a critical and
box-office hit. Rachel Weisz won the Academy Award for Best
Supporting Actress. 

Dirty Pretty Things
Buena Vista
96.Dirty Pretty Things(2002)
Just a year after she charmed audiences in international crossover rom-
com hit Amélie Audrey Tautou starred opposite Chiwetel Ejiofor (12
Years a Slave) in a dark English thriller from High
Fidelity director Stephen
Frears and Spencer screenwriter Steven Knight. Gripping and
humane Dirty Pretty Things centers on London-based émigrés working
in a posh hotel and a conspiracy they uncover following the discovery of
a human heart clogging a toilet. This is highly effective as a thriller— and
the touching story transcends genre. 

Widows
20th Century Fox
95.Widows(2018)


Loosely based on a 1980s British TV series co-adapted by
director Steve McQueen and Gone Girl scribe Gillian
Flynn Widows stars Viola Davis as Veronica Rawlings a representative
for the Chicago Teachers Union whose husband Harry (Liam Neeson)
happens to be a high-end professional thief. It’s the title of the movie so
it’s hardly a spoiler to say a job goes wrong and Harry’s team gets blown
up in the film’s opening minutes. 
A box-office disappointment in 2018 gloriously
entertaining Widows deserves to be seen as widely as possible. 12
Years a Slave and Shame filmmaker McQueen made a multiplex-ready
action picture without losing any of his edge. 

Memento
Summit/Newmarket
94.Memento(2000)


Christopher Nolan’s critically acclaimed Oscar-nominated
breakthrough is a murder mystery in reverse. Guy Pearce Joe
Pantaliano and Carrie-Anne Moss star in the absorbing if disorienting
(by design) potboiler about a man desperately searching for his wife’s
killer. 

Eastern Promises
Focus Features
93.Eastern Promises(2007)


Arguably David Cronenberg's most polished and sophisticated effort to
date Eastern Promises stars Viggo Mortensen as a Russian career
criminal in London who discovers deep corruption with the help of a
midwife (Naomi Watts). For good reason the most famous scene sees
a fully nude Mortensen fight two would-be-assailants to the bitter death
in a Turkish bath. He was nominated for a Best Actor Oscar. 

Training Day
Warner Bros. 
92.Training Day(2001)
Denzel Washington ignites the screen opposite Ethan
Hawke in Antoine Fuqua's crime movie about a corrupt veteran cop
escorting a rookie on his first day in LAPD's inner-city narcotics unit. 
Washington won the Academy Award for Best Actor on a historic night
for the Oscars as Halle Berry won Best Actress for Monster's Ball
and Sidney Poitier was honored for lifetime achievement. Training
Day remains one of the most iconic roles for Hollywood's most respected
living actor. 

Drive
FilmDistrict
91.Drive(2011)
Nicholas Winding Refn's breakthrough (still his best movie by a
margin) is a triumph of style over substance. A hardly animated but
pitch-perfect Ryan Gosling plays a stunt driver who becomes entangled
in a web of organized crime. The biggest triumph of Drive is in the
details. It's a fairly conventional crime story but the storytelling defies
convention at nearly every turn. Drive is quietly exhilarating. Refn won
the Cannes Film Festival's Best Director prize. 

Misery
MGM
90.Misery(1990)


The Academy doesn’t pay attention to horror movies very much 
but Kathy Bates won the Best Actress Oscar for playing a psychopathic
fan who kidnaps her favorite author (James Caan) in a snowstorm 
forcing him to write stories for her. Nearly 30 years after its release Rob
Reiner‘s Misery is still unbridled squirmy psychological terror tough to
watch in all the right ways. 

The Handmaiden
CJ Entertainment
89.The Handmaiden(2016)


This erotic psychological thriller is such a twisty ride that it almost feels
like a spoiler to tell you it’s a romance. Park Chan-wook‘s elegant
suspenser tells of blossoming love between a wealthy Japanese woman
(Kim Min-hee) and a Korean pickpocket (Kim Tae-ri)… and of the men
who try to control and oppress them. For any viewer willing to embrace
the subtitles some shocking sex and gore and a hefty runtime The
Handmaiden is a giddy blast. It won a BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in
the English Language. 

Shutter Island
Paramount Pictures
88.Shutter Island(2010)


Martin Scorsese directs Leonardo DiCaprio in a neo-noir about a U.S. 
Marshal investigating an isolated psychiatric facility after a patient
disappears. The third-act twist isn’t surprising but handsome craft and
terrific performances (the supporting cast includes Michelle
Williams Mark Ruffalo Ben Kingsley and Max von Sydow)
make Shutter Island entertaining and worthwhile. Based on Dennis
Lehane‘s novel. 

Wind River
TWC
87.Wind River(2017)


Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen are terrific
in Yellowstone creator Taylor Sheridan‘s twisting focused often
shocking thriller set around the mysterious death of a young Native
American woman in the modern American West. The outstanding Wind
River deserved Oscar nods. The filmmaker and stars fought to have
producer Harvey Weinstein's name removed from the project in the wake
of #MeToo after which Lionsgate took control of distribution. 

Dressed to Kill
Getty Images
86.Dressed to Kill(1980)


Since 1960 countless thrillers have referenced Psycho perhaps none
more deliciously than De Palma's Dressed to Kill an exercise in style
over substance. The psycho killer thriller starring Michael Caine Angie
Dickinson and Nancy Allen weaves a lurid mystery that's compulsively
watchable. With mesmerizing set pieces (most notably a breathlessly
erotic trip through the Metropolitan Museum of Art) and an appealing
blend of elegance and lowbrow throughout Dressed to Kill remains a
twisty cult favorite. 

Sorcerer

85.Sorcerer(1977)


Due mostly if not entirely to timing (Sorcerer had the misfortune of being
released less than a month after Star Wars was released to record-
obliterating success) William Friedkin's masterful reimagining of The
Wages of Fear centered on a perilous South American transport of
nitroglycerin bombed with critics and audiences out of the gate. It's
since been re-assessed and in 2013 was restored under Friedkin's
supervision. 

Nocturnal Animals
Focus Features
84.Nocturnal Animals(2016)
As brutal as it is sad—and it’s both—Tom Ford‘s second feature twists
the blade in the corpse of a toxic failed relationship. Amy Adams Jake
Gyllenhaal Aaron Taylor-Johnson (Golden Globe winner for his work
here) and Michael Shannon (Oscar nominee for his work here) are
uniformly sensational in dark sumptuously realized parallel storylines
(about half of the movie is a fictional book within the narrative).
Gobsmacking visually and disturbing thematically Nocturnal Animals is
something like a masterpiece. 

Fatal Attraction
Paramount Pictures
83.Fatal Attraction(1987)


The late ’80s and early ’90s saw a boom of erotic thrillers none more
popular than Adrian Lyne‘s scorcher from screenwriter James
Dearden's short film diversion. Glenn Close is iconic femme fatale Alex
Forrest who torments the family of a lawyer (Michael Douglas)
following an ill-fated affair. 
Originally Fatal Attraction had a downbeat ending that didn’t test well. It
was reshot for maximum thrill value. The movie was the highest-grossing
film of 1987 grossing over $320 million against a $14 million budget.
