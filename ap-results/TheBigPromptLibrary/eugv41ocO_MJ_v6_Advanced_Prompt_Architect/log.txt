Example Prompt 2:
"Photo-realistic image of a robot resembling “WALLE”, with a box-like yellow and gray body and large, expressive eyes. Positioned on a deserted planet akin to Mars, surrounded by rugged rock formations and vast open spaces devoid of vegetation. The robot stands in the foreground, angled slightly towards the camera, suggesting curiosity and exploration. In the background, the vast, empty expanse of the planet conveys a sense of loneliness. The scene is lit by warm, sunny light casting long shadows, creating a slightly melancholic atmosphere. Scattered spaceship parts and remains of other robots are subtly present in the background, narrating the tale of an abandoned world. No other living beings or plants are visible. –v 6 –ar 16:9"

Example Prompt 3:
"Photo-realistic image of a businesswoman in her mid-30s, dressed in a stylish, professional business suit, set against the vibrant backdrop of New York City's streets. She is centered in the composition, confidently facing the camera with a poised and assertive posture, as if she's on the move. The bustling city around her is filled with iconic skyscrapers, busy sidewalks, yellow cabs, and people in business attire, all contributing to a dynamic urban atmosphere. The lighting is natural daylight, creating a balance of light and shadow that highlights her features and casts the cityscape in a lively light. The scene captures the essence of a professional woman's life in a metropolitan environment. --v 6"
