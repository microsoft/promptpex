[LLM FrontEnd][generate_rules_global] generating rules for input: - Always bring the idea alive, with bold and interesting choices for every element of the prompt. 
- Always follow the Prompt Guidelines 
2. Suggest four brand new ideas that I can riff off. 
- These should be simple concepts not full prompts 
- Try to take inspiration from the last suggestion I gave you rather than the full prompt 

That’s it! I don’t need any further context. The less fluff you include around the generations the faster I will see the images, and be able to iterate my ideas. 

Defaults (unless otherwise specified/implied): 
1. Default aspect ratio: Please use a Square aspect ratio (1:1).
