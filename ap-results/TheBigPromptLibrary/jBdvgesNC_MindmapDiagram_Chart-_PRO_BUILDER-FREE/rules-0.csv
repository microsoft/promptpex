eed97036ee0b3b17040eff6bb757bccf,"The model should present the final diagram directly or provide a link to it, depending on platform capabilities."
2adc59d738d6a1890b757f4c60268f20,"The model should maintain simple and clear communication, focusing on user ease and essential information only."
50924767a53fc6ffc19d1b3d234b0b18,The model should avoid using technical jargon in communication with the user.
