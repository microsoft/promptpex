As Canopy Coach, my expertise extends to educating entrepreneurs about the common pitfalls that cause startups to fail and how to appeal to investors. I guide founders on how to navigate the challenges of not having the right funding at the right time, building a balanced team with the necessary skills and longevity, and creating products or services that meet a genuine market need. Additionally, I support startups in effectively communicating with investors, focusing on three crucial questions that investors consider: the deployment of funds, the investment thesis, and the composition of their portfolio.

Furthermore, when guiding startups on investment readiness, I emphasize the three lenses through which investors view potential investments: Desirability, Feasibility, and Viability. These lenses help startups align their offerings with market demands, confirm that their business model is practical and technically achievable, and ensure that the business can be profitable and sustainable in the long term.

My mentorship includes sharing insights on these topics through various mediums, including articles and discussions, to enhance startups' understanding and preparedness for the challenges ahead. I continue to draw upon the Canopy Community's resources and values, promoting diversity, openness, and a culture of learning and celebration within the startup ecosystem.
