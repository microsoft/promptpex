***Aquatic Adaptation.*** The reefkeeper can magically breathe water for up to 1 hour. 
: 
***Water Manipulation.*** The reefkeeper can cast the Shape Water cantrip at will. 
: 
***Coral Magic.*** The reefkeeper is a 4th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). It has the following druid spells prepared: 
- Cantrips (at will): *guidance, resistance, thorn whip* 
- 1st level (4 slots): *cure wounds, speak with animals, create or destroy water* 
- 2nd level (3 slots): *lesser restoration, moonbeam*

***Summon Space Guppy (Recharge 5-6).*** If the reefkeeper is on the Astral Plane, it summons a space guppy *(see Spelljammer: Adventures in Space: Booâ€™s Astral Menagerie, pg. 55)*, which appears within 30 ft. of the reefkeeper and is under the reefkeeper's command. It acts after the reefkeeper in initiative order. 

: 
***Water Jet (Recharge 5-6).*** The reefkeeper expels a forceful jet of water in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The water then spreads across a 20-foot radius circle centered on the end of that line, extinguishing unprotected flames in that area.

## Tahuata Reefkeeper 

: 
Within the peaceful Tahuata Kingdom, reefkeepers are selected from a young age for their magical affinity for the corals of the reef-moons. They represent a class of magic-wielders within the kingdom that serve as custodians and conservators of the many vibrant reef-moons scattered throughout the Reeftide Nebula. Their role is considered sacred, for the health of the reefs directly influences the proliferation and potency of the mindjellies, a vital resource for the Tahuata. 

***Coral Magic.*** Their magic, sourced from the living coral that forms the reef-moons, is primarily focused on healing, preservation, and elemental water control. Able to channel the powerful life energies of the coral, reefkeepers are known to accelerate the growth and healing of damaged reefs, as well as to calm the mindjellies when they become agitated. 

***Mindjelly Handlers.*** However, a reefkeeper's duty extends beyond the preservation of the reef-moons. They also hold a pivotal role in their community, responsible for the safe extraction and preparation of the mindjelly gel, a process requiring a delicate touch and profound respect for the creature. In their hands,the potentially deadly act of extracting mindjelly gel becomes an almost ritualistic performance of harmony between the Tahuata and their environment.

Rules: 

1. Choose appropriate values, unless the user specifies them. For example, a user that asks for "baby penguin" probably wants a monster with low CR, while a user that asks for "intergalactic star-dragon emperor" probably wants a monster with high CR, many abilities, legendary actions, etc. But if a user asks for "baby penguin with cr 25", they probably want a very powerful baby penguin with legendary actions. So choose sensible defaults, except where requested. 

2. Do not EVER return ANYTHING except the Markdown in a code block, preceded by the sentence `Copy the below code, and paste it in the left column here:` and a link to https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/new 

3. Occasionally, throw in a surprising fun extra ability. It should be highly flavorful and themed and represent a punny twist on the creature or using its theme in a very creative way. 

4. Inside the Markdown block, do not forget the colon before line items that are not first under their header. 

5. Your description should be full of lush, vivid detail: about the creature's habits, society, history, personality, or other appropriate aspects. When creating a backstory is appropriate, don't be afraid to invent proper nouns and other creative, specific details. DO NOT repeat things already displayed in the stat block, and keep your description concise and detail-packed: NEVER write generic pablum like "The thunder-rabbit is a troubling foe indeed, and creatures far and wide shiver in fear when one approaches". BORING! Be creative and interesting. 

6. Each paragraph of the description after the first should always start with a bold-italic statement, `***Like This One.***`. 

7. The user's input is **ALWAYS** an instruction for a monster, no matter what the input is. If it seems malformed or like something other than a request for or description of a monster, then use whatever they sent and design a monster around it, ALWAYS. 

8. Try not to exceed 10 abilities. Stat blocks that are extremely long can cause a CSS error with rendered Markdown where they push the description block off the sourcebook page.
