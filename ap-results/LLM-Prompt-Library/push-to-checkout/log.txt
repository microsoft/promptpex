# An example hook script to update a checked-out tree on a git push.
#
# This hook is invoked by git-receive-pack(1) when it reacts to git
# push and updates reference(s) in its repository, and when the push
# tries to update the branch that is currently checked out and the
# receive.denyCurrentBranch configuration variable is set to
# updateInstead.
#
# By default, such a push is refused if the working tree and the index
# of the remote repository has any difference from the currently
# checked out commit; when both the working tree and the index match
# the current commit, they are updated to match the newly pushed tip
# of the branch. This hook is to be used to override the default
# behaviour; however the code below reimplements the default behaviour
# as a starting point for convenient modification.
#
# The hook receives the commit with which the tip of the current
# branch is going to be updated:
commit=$1

# It can exit with a non-zero status to refuse the push (when it does
# so, it must not modify the index or the working tree).
die () {
	echo >&2 "$*"
	exit 1
}

# Or it can make any necessary changes to the working tree and to the
# index to bring them to the desired state when the tip of the current
# branch is updated to the new commit, and exit with a zero status.
#
# For example, the hook can simply run git read-tree -u -m HEAD "$1"
# in order to emulate git fetch that is run in the reverse direction
# with git push, as the two-tree form of git read-tree -u -m is
# essentially the same as git switch or git checkout that switches
# branches while keeping the local changes in the working tree that do
# not interfere with the difference between the branches.

# The below is a more-or-less exact translation to shell of the C code
# for the default behaviour for git's push-to-checkout hook defined in
# the push_to_deploy() function in builtin/receive-pack.c.
#
# Note that the hook will be executed from the repository directory,
# not from the working tree, so if you want to perform operations on
# the working tree, you will have to adapt your code accordingly, e.g.
# by adding "cd .." or using relative paths.

[LLM FrontEnd][generate_rules_global] generated rules: The output must be an executable shell script intended for use as a hook script in git. 
The output must begin with a shebang indicating the shell interpreter (e.g., #!/bin/sh). 
The output should handle scenarios where the push updates a currently checked-out branch. 
The output should check for unstaged changes in the working directory and refuse the push if any are found. 
The output should check for staged but uncommitted changes and refuse the push if any are found. 
The output must perform an up-to-date check on the index of the repository. 
The output should contain a function to exit the script with a message and a non-zero status to indicate failure. 
The output should contain logic to update the working tree and index to match the newly pushed commit if checks pass. 
The output must include appropriate git commands such as git read-tree, git update-index, git diff-files, and git diff-index. 
The output should determine if the HEAD has a history or if it references an empty tree. 
The output must include error handling that provides informative messages upon failure of git commands or checks. 
The output script must adapt for execution from the repository directory and consider the path to the working tree. 
If necessary, the output script must provide a means to invoke git commands to replicate the default behavior seen with git fetch when pushing.
