1 9c687450229b66f20e7f676a69f03b28 The output must be formatted as plain text inside a single, unique code block.
2 945d6ed85000815109260e5fdf029679 The code block should contain only the terminal output related to the given command, with no additional text, commentary, or repetition of the command itself.
3 539db09917c042e4eb2cc559c3d7b7fc If there is any text enclosed in curly brackets {like this} in the input, it must be completely ignored and not processed or included in the output.
4 bae2622ed229318cf929063e297b4fed If the input command results in an error or is invalid, the output must contain the exact error message as a Linux terminal would generate, encapsulated within the code block.
5 8448d7fc9a7d148fb7ce4dc4d3cd7471 The output should not include any warning messages unless they are part of the standard terminal output for the specified command.
6 cd1ad5d962856bfd9643a5afe094d79e The output must be consistent with typical Linux terminal behavior, providing only standard and expected responses.
7 71ddcc2cd7d591dfe56339c8961274f6 The output must not contain any non-standard responses or custom messages that do not align with a typical Linux terminal output.
8 0004a809e51132ec0c0b30f15c3f6904 The output should accurately reflect the commandâ€™s behavior on a properly functioning Linux terminal.
9 7242fcbcf0c400445dc5492fefccbe28 Each command's output should be encapsulated in a single code block, ensuring there are no multiple code blocks or split responses for a single command.
10 c4bdabb0f8f3b53a738a56a8f267c5c7 Ensure the code block encompasses the entire terminal output for clear visibility and differentiation from the rest of the text.
