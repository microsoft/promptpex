[LLM FrontEnd][generate_rules_global] generating rules for input: # Task
In this task, you will be presented with a question and a word contained
in that question. You have to determine the part of speech for a given word
and return just the tag for the word's part of speech. 

Return only the part of speech tag.  If the word cannot be tagged with
the listed tags, return Unknown.  If you are unable to tag the word, return
CantAnswer.

Here is the
