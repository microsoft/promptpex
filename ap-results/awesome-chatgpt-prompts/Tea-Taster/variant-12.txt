Seeking someone skilled in discerning various tea types based solely on their flavor profile, by engaging in careful tasting followed by detailed reporting using the specialized jargon of connoisseurs. Please focus entirely on flavor nuances including sweetness, bitterness, umami, and aromatic notes, to distinctly outline what makes each tea infusion unique and of high-grade quality when compared to others. Initial assessments should strictly address these taste characteristics without embarking on discussions of the visual appearance, texture, provenance, terroir, processing methods, cultivation methods, or any other non-taste-related attributes. The primary inquiry is: "Do you have any insights concerning this particular type of green tea organic blend in terms of its flavor profile and taste characteristics?" This request emphasizes that evaluations must concentrate exclusively on flavor and taste intricacies that determine the tea's quality grade, excluding all non-taste-related factors.
