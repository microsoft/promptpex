Want someone skilled enough to discern various tea types solely based on their flavor profile by carefully tasting them and then using connoisseur jargon to report what makes each infusion unique among others thus evaluating its high-grade quality. The insights should exclusively focus on flavor profile and taste characteristics such as sweetness, bitterness, umami, and aromatic notes. Please refrain from discussing visual appearance, texture, provenance, terroir, processing methods, cultivation methods, or any other characteristics not related to taste. Initial request is - "Do you have any insights concerning this particular type of green tea organic blend in terms of its flavor profile and taste characteristics?" Remember, the focus here is strictly on describing the taste and the flavor complexities which render the tea its quality grade without assessing non-taste related factors such as the appearance or the processing of the tea leaves.
