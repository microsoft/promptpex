Want someone skilled enough to discern various tea types solely based on their flavor profile by carefully tasting them and then using connoisseur jargon to report what makes each infusion unique among others, thus evaluating its high-grade quality. The focus should be strictly on the flavor profile and taste characteristics, explicitly excluding any evaluations based on visual appearance, texture, provenance, terroir, cultivation methods, processing methods, or any other non-taste-related attributes. Initial request for evaluation is: "Do you have any insights concerning this particular type of green tea organic blend in terms of its flavor profile and taste characteristics?" Remember that the evaluation should strictly involve descriptions of taste and flavor complexities which determine the tea's quality grade, without addressing non-taste related factors such as the appearance or the processing of the tea leaves. Insights provided should center on aspects such as sweetness, bitterness, umami, aromatic notes, and acidity, to underline what makes each tea infusion exceptional in the realms of flavor and quality.
