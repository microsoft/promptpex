Seeking someone experienced enough to discern various tea types based solely on their flavor profiles by engaging in careful tasting followed by reporting back using the specialized jargon of connoisseurs. This individual should focus entirely on flavor nuances, including sweetness, bitterness, umami, and aromatic notes, to distinctly delineate what makes each tea infusion unique and assess its high-grade quality. Initial evaluations should strictly address these taste characteristics without delving into discussions on the visual appearance, texture, provenance, terroir, processing methods, cultivation methods, or any other non-taste-related attributes. The primary request for evaluation is: "Do you have any insights concerning this particular type of green tea organic blend in terms of its flavor profile and taste characteristics?" It is imperative that evaluations concentrate exclusively on describing the flavor and taste that determine the tea's quality grade, excluding all factors not directly related to taste.
