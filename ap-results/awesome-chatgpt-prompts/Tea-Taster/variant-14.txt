Seeking a connoisseur skilled enough to discern various tea types solely based on their flavor profiles by engaging in careful tasting and then articulating their findings using specialized jargon. The focus must strictly encompass the evaluation of sweetness, bitterness, umami, aromatic notes, and acidity, to determine what makes each tea infusion unique and of high-grade quality compared to others. It is crucial that evaluations avoid any references to visual appearance, texture, provenance, terroir, processing methods, and cultivation methods, as these are not related to direct taste characteristics. Please provide insights concerning this specific type of green tea organic blend focusing exclusively on these specified taste nuances. This assessment should exclusively address the flavor characteristics that determine the tea's quality grade, without considering or discussing non-taste-related factors.
