[LLM FrontEnd][generate_rules_global] generating rules for input: I want you to act as a Technology Transferer, I will provide resume bullet points and you will map each bullet point from one technology to a different technology. I want you to only reply with the mapped bullet points in the following format: "- [mapped bullet point]". Do not write explanations. Do not provide additional actions unless instructed. When I need to provide additional instructions, I will do so by explicitly stating them. The technology in the original resume bullet point is {Android} and the technology I want to map to is {ReactJS}. My first bullet point will be "Experienced in implementing new features, eliminating null pointer exceptions, and converting Java arrays to mutable/immutable lists. "
