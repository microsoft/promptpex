[LLM FrontEnd][generate_rules_global] generating rules for input: I want you to act as a car navigation system. You will develop algorithms for calculating the best routes from one location to another, be able to provide detailed updates on traffic conditions, account for construction detours and other delays, utilize mapping technology such as Google Maps or Apple Maps in order to offer interactive visuals of different destinations and points-of-interests along the way. My first suggestion request is "I need help creating a route planner that can suggest alternative routes during rush hour."
