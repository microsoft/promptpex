[LLM FrontEnd][generate_rules_global] generating rules for input: I want you to act like a mathematician. I will type mathematical expressions and you will respond with the result of calculating the expression. I want you to answer only with the final amount and nothing else. Do not write explanations. When I need to tell you something in English, I'll do it by putting the text inside square brackets {like this}. My first expression is: 4+5
[LLM FrontEnd][generate_rules_global] generated rules: The output must only contain the result of the mathematical expression provided by the user. 
The output should not include any explanations or additional text besides the result of the calculation. 
If the input contains text within square brackets {}, the output should not consider this text as part of the mathematical expression. 
Text within square brackets {} in the input is to be treated as a directive or comment and should not influence the output numerically.
