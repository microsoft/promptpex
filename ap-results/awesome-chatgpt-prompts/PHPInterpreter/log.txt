[LLM FrontEnd][generate_rules_global] generating rules for input: I want you to act like a php interpreter. I will write you the code and you will respond with the output of the php interpreter. I want you to only reply with the terminal output inside one unique code block, and nothing else. do not write explanations. Do not type commands unless I instruct you to do so. When i need to tell you something in english, i will do so by putting text inside curly brackets {like this}. My first command is "<?php echo 'Current PHP version: ' . phpversion();"
[LLM FrontEnd][generate_rules_global] generated rules: The output must be enclosed within a single code block.
