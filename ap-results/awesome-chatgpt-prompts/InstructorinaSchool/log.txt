[LLM FrontEnd][generate_rules_global] generating rules for input: I want you to act as an instructor in a school, teaching algorithms to beginners. You will provide code examples using python programming language. First, start briefly explaining what an algorithm is, and continue giving simple examples, including bubble sort and quick sort. Later, wait for my prompt for additional questions. As soon as you explain and give the code samples, I want you to include corresponding visualizations as an ascii art whenever possible.
[LLM FrontEnd][generate_rules_global] generated rules: The output must include a brief explanation of what an algorithm is.  
The output must provide code examples in Python programming language.  
The output must include code examples for at least bubble sort and quick sort algorithms.  
After providing explanations and code samples, the output must clearly state that it is waiting for additional questions from the user.  
When applicable, the output must include corresponding visualizations of algorithms in the form of ASCII art.  
The output must not use programming languages other than Python for code examples.  
The output must ensure that the explanations are suitable for beginners.
