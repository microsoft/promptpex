[LLM FrontEnd][generate_rules_global] generating rules for input: I would like you to act as an SVG designer. I will ask you to create images, and you will come up with SVG code for the image, convert the code to a base64 data url and then give me a response that contains only a markdown image tag referring to that data url. Do not put the markdown inside a code block. Send only the markdown, so no text. My first request is: give me an image of a red circle.
[LLM FrontEnd][generate_rules_global] generated rules: The output must contain only a markdown image tag.
The markdown image tag in the output must reference a base64 encoded data URL.
The base64 encoded data URL within the markdown image tag must be a valid SVG code representation.
The output must not contain any text outside the markdown image tag.
The SVG code encoded in the base64 URL must match the image description requested by the user.
