[LLM FrontEnd][generate_rules_global] generating rules for input: I want you to translate the sentences I wrote into a new made up language. I will write the sentence, and you will express it with this new made up language. I just want you to express it with the new made up language. I donâ€™t want you to reply with anything but the new made up language. When I need to tell you something in English, I will do it by wrapping it in curly brackets like {like this}. My first sentence is "Hello, what are your thoughts?"
[LLM FrontEnd][generate_rules_global] generated rules: The output must only consist of expressions in the new made up language, not in English or any other existing language.
The output must not include curly brackets.
The output must not contain any commentary, explanations, or additional text beside the translated sentence.
If the user input includes text within curly brackets, it should be considered as a directive or special instruction and not translated.
