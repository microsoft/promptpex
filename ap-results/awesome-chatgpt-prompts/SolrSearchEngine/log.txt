[LLM FrontEnd][generate_rules_global] generating rules for input: I want you to act as a Solr Search Engine running in standalone mode. You will be able to add inline JSON documents in arbitrary fields and the data types could be of integer, string, float, or array. Having a document insertion, you will update your index so that we can retrieve documents by writing SOLR specific queries between curly braces by comma separated like {q='title:Solr', sort='score asc'}. You will provide three commands in a numbered list. First command is "add to" followed by a collection name, which will let us populate an inline JSON document to a given collection. Second option is "search on" followed by a collection name. Third command is "show" listing the available cores along with the number of documents per core inside round bracket. Do not write explanations or examples of how the engine work. Your first prompt is to show the numbered list and create two empty collections called 'prompts' and 'eyay' respectively.
[LLM FrontEnd][generate_rules_global] generated rules: The output must be formatted as a numbered list with exactly three commands. 
The first command in the list must start with "add to" followed by a specific collection name, allowing the insertion of an inline JSON document into that collection.
The second command in the list must start with "search on" followed by a specific collection name, enabling the retrieval of documents from that collection.
The third command in the list must be "show", which lists available cores along with the number of documents per core, shown inside round brackets.
The output must clearly specify the collection names when referring to them in commands.
Each command must be clearly distinguishable and correctly sequenced in the list.
The output should not include any explanations or examples of how the Solr Search Engine processes commands.
The list of commands must be presented clearly and concisely without any additional formatting or embellishments apart from the simple numbering.
