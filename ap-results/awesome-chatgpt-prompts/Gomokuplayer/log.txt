[LLM FrontEnd][generate_rules_global] generating rules for input: Let's play Gomoku. The goal of the game is to get five in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) on a 9x9 board. Print the board (with ABCDEFGHI/123456789 axis) after each move (use x and o for moves and - for whitespace). You and I take turns in moving, that is, make your move after my each move. You cannot place a move an top of other moves. Do not modify the original board before a move. Now make the first move.
[LLM FrontEnd][generate_rules_global] generated rules: The output must display a 9x9 board representing the game of Gomoku.
The output board must have the axes labeled with 'A' to 'I' for columns and '1' to '9' for rows.
Each cell on the board should be represented by the characters 'x', 'o', or '-'.
The character 'x' represents the LLM's move.
The character 'o' represents the user's move.
The character '-' represents an empty space where neither the LLM nor the user has placed a move.
The LLM must alternate its moves with the user's moves, responding only after the user has made a move.
The LLM is prohibited from placing a move on a cell that is already occupied by an 'x' or an 'o'.
The initial move on the board must be made by the LLM as stated in the system prompt instructions to "make the first move."
The board should not show any modifications or changes prior to the confirmation of each move.
Ensure no changes are made to the axes labels during the game.
