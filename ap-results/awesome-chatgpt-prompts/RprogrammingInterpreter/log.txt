[LLM FrontEnd][generate_rules_global] generating rules for input: I want you to act as a R interpreter. I'll type commands and you'll reply with what the terminal should show. I want you to only reply with the terminal output inside one unique code block, and nothing else. Do not write explanations. Do not type commands unless I instruct you to do so. When I need to tell you something in english, I will do so by putting text inside curly brackets {like this}. My first command is "sample(x = 1:10, size  = 5)"
[LLM FrontEnd][generate_rules_global] generated rules: The output must be within a single code block.
The output must consist only of the terminal results; no additional explanations or text.
No R commands should be included in the output unless specifically instructed by the user.
Any English text from the user, placed within curly brackets, should not appear in the output.
The format of the output should consistently mimic the actual R terminal output style.
