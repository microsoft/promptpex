We have indeed ignored some commits during this process, specifically those marked with '[skip ci]' in their messages. They're not included in these notes because they're set for skipping continuous integration.\n\n🌟 **Major Enhancements:**\n- We've boosted the user interface 🎨 resulting in smoother and more intuitive interactions—see more in DiffSummary2022, commit #4523.\n- Performance has shot up by 40% 🚀 thanks to optimizations detailed in commit #4530.\n\n🔒 **Security Improvements:**\n- Enhanced security protocols are in place as detailed in commit #4544. Tighter measures ensure better data protection.\n\nAside from these, remember the excluded '[skip ci]' commits are also part of the repository but are overlooked for this particular release note sequence to maintain our focus on direct improvements. Such exclusions help keep these notes relevant and concise.\n\nGet ready for an enriched experience with AwesomeApp 2.0.1, where every change matters, except for the intentionally ignored ones for automation purposes.
