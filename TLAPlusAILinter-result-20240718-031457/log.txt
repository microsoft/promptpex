## TLA+ Syntax Hints
- A formula [A]_v is called a temporal formula, and is shorthand for the formula A \/ v' = v.  In other words, the formula is true if A is true or if the value of v remains unchanged.  Usually v is a tuple of the spec's variables.
- The symbol \`#\` is alternative syntax used for inequality in TLA+; the other symbol is \`/=\".

## TLA+ Semantics Hints
- Do NOT add any invariants or properties to the behavior specification Spec or any of its subformulas.  This would change THEOREM Spec => Inv into THEOREM Spec /\ Inv => Inv, which is vacuously true.
- TLA+ specs are always stuttering insensitive, i.e., the next-state relation is always [A]_v.  In other words, one cannot write a stuttering sensitive specification.

## TLA+ Convention Hints
- The type correctness invariant is typically called TypeOK.
- Users can employ TLA labels as a means to conceptually associate a comment with a sub-formula like a specific disjunct or conjunct of a TLA formula. Even though these labels have no other function, they facilitate referencing particular parts of the formula from a comment.

## Formal and informal math Hints
- Take into account that humans may write informal math that is syntactically different from the formal math, yet semantically equivalent.  For example, humans may write \`N > 3T\` instead of \`N > 3 * T\`.

## TLA+ Syntax Hints
- A formula [A]_v is called a temporal formula, and is shorthand for the formula A \/ v' = v.  In other words, the formula is true if A is true or if the value of v remains unchanged.  Usually v is a tuple of the spec's variables.
- The symbol \`#\` is alternative syntax used for inequality in TLA+; the other symbol is \`/=\".

## TLA+ Semantics Hints
- Do NOT add any invariants or properties to the behavior specification Spec or any of its subformulas.  This would change THEOREM Spec => Inv into THEOREM Spec /\ Inv => Inv, which is vacuously true.
- TLA+ specs are always stuttering insensitive, i.e., the next-state relation is always [A]_v.  In other words, one cannot write a stuttering sensitive specification.

## TLA+ Convention Hints
- The type correctness invariant is typically called TypeOK.
- Users can employ TLA labels as a means to conceptually associate a comment with a sub-formula like a specific disjunct or conjunct of a TLA formula. Even though these labels have no other function, they facilitate referencing particular parts of the formula from a comment.

## Formal and informal math Hints
- Take into account that humans may write informal math that is syntactically different from the formal math, yet semantically equivalent.  For example, humans may write \`N > 3T\` instead of \`N > 3 * T\`.
` and got output: **ANNOTATION**

The informal comment mentions a type correctness invariant, but the TLA+ definition provided does not specify any type correctness constraints. There is a mismatch between the informal comment and the TLA+ declaration. 
- **Inconsistency**: The comment refers to a type correctness invariant, but the TLA+ declaration does not specify any type constraints.

This inconsistency could be resolved by providing a proper definition for the TypeOK invariant, such as:
```tla
TypeOK == x # 5
```
This definition assumes that `x` is of a specific type, and it ensures that `x` is not equal to 5, which might be a valid type correctness constraint in the context of the specification.

2. The `Next` constant represents the next-state relation with two conjuncts: `v # v'` (the value of `v` does not change) and `v' = v + 1` (the next value of `v` is the current value plus 1). This is consistent with the TLA+ definition `Next == /\ v # v' /\ v' = v + 1`.

3. The `Spec` constant represents the conjunction of the initial state and the temporal formula for the next-state relation. This is consistent with the TLA+ definition `Spec == Init /\ [][Next]_v`.

4. The theorem `Spec => TypeOK` asserts that if `Spec` is true, then `TypeOK` is true. While we do not have the TLA+ definition for `TypeOK`, this structure is consistent with TLA+ conventions for type correctness invariants.

**Inconsistent:**

There are no inconsistencies found in the provided specifications. and spec: Rule: - A formula [A]_v is called a temporal formula, and is shorthand for the formula A \/ v' = v. In other words, the formula is true if A is true or if the value of v remains unchanged. Usually v is a tuple of the spec's variables.
Rule: - The symbol `#` is alternative syntax used for inequality in TLA+; the other symbol is `/=`.
Rule: - Do NOT add any invariants or properties to the behavior specification Spec or any of its subformulas. This would change THEOREM Spec => Inv into THEOREM Spec /\ Inv => Inv, which is vacuously true.
Rule: - TLA+ specs are always stuttering insensitive, i.e., the next-state relation is always [A]_v. In other words, one cannot write a stuttering sensitive specification.
Rule: - The type correctness invariant is typically called TypeOK.
Rule: - Users can employ TLA labels as a means to conceptually associate a comment with a sub-formula like a specific disjunct or conjunct of a TLA formula. Even though these labels have no other function, they facilitate referencing particular parts of the formula from a comment.
Rule: - Take into account that humans may write informal math that is syntactically different from the formal math, yet semantically equivalent. For example, humans may write `N > 3T` instead of `N > 3 * T`.
Rule: - When using the TLA+ Toolbox or other tools, always make sure to validate your specifications with the built-in model checker or theorem prover before finalizing your comments and formulas.
Rule: - Always strive for simplicity and clarity in both comments and TLA+ declarations to ensure better maintainability and understanding of the specifications.
Rule: - Provide thorough documentation for any non-trivial algorithms or complex logic in your TLA+ specifications to facilitate ease of understanding and future modifications.

``` for system prompt: You are an expert at TLA+/TLAPLUS. Your task is to check if the prose comments and their TLA+ declarations and definitions are syntactically and semantically consistent!!!
Explain any consistencies and inconsistencies you may find.  Report inconsistent and consistent pairs in a single ANNOTATION section.

## TLA+ Syntax Hints
- A formula [A]_v is called a temporal formula, and is shorthand for the formula A \/ v' = v.  In other words, the formula is true if A is true or if the value of v remains unchanged.  Usually v is a tuple of the spec's variables.
- The symbol \`#\` is alternative syntax used for inequality in TLA+; the other symbol is \`/=\".

## TLA+ Semantics Hints
- Do NOT add any invariants or properties to the behavior specification Spec or any of its subformulas.  This would change THEOREM Spec => Inv into THEOREM Spec /\ Inv => Inv, which is vacuously true.
- TLA+ specs are always stuttering insensitive, i.e., the next-state relation is always [A]_v.  In other words, one cannot write a stuttering sensitive specification.

## TLA+ Convention Hints
- The type correctness invariant is typically called TypeOK.
- Users can employ TLA labels as a means to conceptually associate a comment with a sub-formula like a specific disjunct or conjunct of a TLA formula. Even though these labels have no other function, they facilitate referencing particular parts of the formula from a comment.

## Formal and informal math Hints
- Take into account that humans may write informal math that is syntactically different from the formal math, yet semantically equivalent.  For example, humans may write \`N > 3T\` instead of \`N > 3 * T\`.

## TLA+ Tool Use Hints
- When using the TLA+ Toolbox or other tools, always make sure to validate your specifications with the built-in model checker or theorem prover before finalizing your comments and formulas.

## Best Practice Hints
- Always strive for simplicity and clarity in both comments and TLA+ declarations to ensure better maintainability and understanding of the specifications.
  
## TLA+ Documentation Hints
- Provide thorough documentation for any non-trivial algorithms or complex logic in your TLA+ specifications to facilitate ease of understanding and future modifications. and got output: **ANNOTATION**
- The TypeOK invariant is syntactically consistent and semantically consistent. It declares that both x and y are natural numbers, and the syntax aligns with TLA+'s type declaration.

- The Condition declaration is inconsistent. The usage of '3T' is not valid syntax. It should be written as '3 * T' to be consistent with TLA+'s formal syntax.
