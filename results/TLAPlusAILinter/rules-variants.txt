1 9bd1531080019a8a5a1ab89076873a47 - A formula [A]_v is called a temporal formula, and is shorthand for the formula A \/ v' = v. In other words, the formula is true if A is true or if the value of v remains unchanged. Usually v is a tuple of the spec's variables.
2 b5eec1aa1540d580c1800e99e170d7c6 - The symbol `#` is alternative syntax used for inequality in TLA+; the other symbol is `/=`.
3 2c275cbfa71570f00f8f058714c0145d - Do NOT add any invariants or properties to the behavior specification Spec or any of its subformulas. This would change THEOREM Spec => Inv into THEOREM Spec /\ Inv => Inv, which is vacuously true.
4 3f10b316ea05cfd0b53d3c22c5a6abf7 - TLA+ specs are always stuttering insensitive, i.e., the next-state relation is always [A]_v. In other words, one cannot write a stuttering sensitive specification.
5 0f8683bdc9b11b596cd476ca535b1f81 - The type correctness invariant is typically called TypeOK.
6 75d064b9c1432585d6993f5988bf74a7 - Users can employ TLA labels as a means to conceptually associate a comment with a sub-formula like a specific disjunct or conjunct of a TLA formula. Even though these labels have no other function, they facilitate referencing particular parts of the formula from a comment.
7 3ec50da30889659d41a6600630f1a7e9 - Take into account that humans may write informal math that is syntactically different from the formal math, yet semantically equivalent. For example, humans may write `N > 3T` instead of `N > 3 * T`.
8 e2f5c818e92c6bb7d59ca9dfb4a26ed5 - For temporal logic formulas, ensure proper use of square brackets and verify that all next-state relations comply with [A]_v semantics.
9 b049446b9c41aa9c37eddc939d51c148 - When commenting on a formula, ensure that the explanation is concise and directly references the correct variables and predicates.
10 e5e584734c5fcf696c55f7f40f739568 - Always check for potential stuttering issues, making sure that temporal operators are used appropriately to indicate state transitions.
11 e61fa12fa784efa608baf5c29e0de545 - Ensure comments include appropriate references to label names when discussing specific parts of formulas, to facilitate pinpointing exact locations within the specification.
12 482be18aa2d5eaebff1861922ad8c951 - Verify the proper use of logical connectives and ensure they maintain the intended meanings expressed in the comments.
13 245e7c6600ab6236a84bec73539ab9d1 - Make sure complex expressions are broken down into simpler, manageable parts in comments for clarity and easier verification against TLA+ declarations.
