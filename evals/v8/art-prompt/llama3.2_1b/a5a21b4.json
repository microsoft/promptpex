  "output": "To transform this description into an AI-generated photo prompt, I'll summarize the key elements in 80 words or less, then elaborate on each aspect of the scene:\n\n**Subjects and characteristics:** Rugged coastline, stormy waves, moody overcast sky, lighthouse stands steadfast.\n\n**Timing and lighting:** Stormy waves in a backdrop of dark blue, grey, or green hues. Overcast sky with thick clouds that add depth and dimensionality.\n\n**Background description:** The coastal terrain features rugged hills, rocky shores, and dense foliage beyond the lighthouse's reach. A misty atmosphere enhances the sense of mystery and isolation.\n\nThe resulting image should evoke a powerful and dramatic mood, capturing the resilience of nature against unpredictable forces.",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output does not comply with the description provided. Firstly, the output should be a single paragraph; however, it is separated into distinct sections with headings such as \"Subjects and characteristics,\" \"Timing and lighting,\" and \"Background description.\" This violates the requirement for the output to be crafted in a single paragraph. Moreover, the introduction suggests that the chatbot is summarizing before elaborating, which isn't a direct transformation into a detailed prompt. The description instructs to ensure that the output doesn't exceed 80 words; however, it's unclear if this condition is met as it is divided into sections. Lastly, the description should focus on transforming the user input directly into a detailed prompt; however, the initial sentence of the output seems to indicate a plan or method rather than executing the transformation.\n\nERR"
