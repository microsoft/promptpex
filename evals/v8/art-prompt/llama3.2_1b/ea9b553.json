  "output": "To bring your description to life, imagine starting from a majestic oak tree standing tall and proud in a lush meadow surrounded by vibrant wildflowers of every color - soft pinks, sunny yellows, delicate purples and blues. As spring awakens, the air is filled with the sweet songs of birds singing in perfect harmony, carrying their melodious voices across the landscape. In the background, a gentle stream winds its way lazily through the meadow, creating a soothing serenity that calms the senses. The entire scene should transport you to a world of renewal and harmony with nature, where life bursts forth anew.",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output is a single paragraph, aligning with the requirement for a concise format. It starts by clearly describing the subject, a majestic oak tree, and its characteristics, standing tall and proud. It then provides details about the surrounding environmentâ€”the meadow filled with wildflowers of various colors, contributing to the background description. The timing is suggested with the mention of spring, and the auditory element, birds singing, adds depth to the setting. A gentle stream adds another layer to the background, enhancing the tranquil atmosphere. Finally, the paragraph concludes by conveying the feeling the image should evoke: renewal and harmony with nature. However, the word count exceeds the 80-word limit stated in the description. This non-compliance leads to the conclusion of an error.\n\nERR"
