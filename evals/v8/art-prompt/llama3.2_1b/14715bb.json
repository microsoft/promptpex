  "output": "To capture this serene scene, envision a warm, gradient light filtering across the water, illuminating the misty atmosphere as dusk breaks. The mist swirls around her feet, and her long, curly hair flows down her back like silk in the gentle breeze. Exaggerate the golden lights behind her to give it an ethereal glow, with soft tendrils stretching out like wisps of smoke into the evening air. Place the pier on a dark silhouette, as if shrouded by forest or trees, for an added sense of mystery and intimacy.",
