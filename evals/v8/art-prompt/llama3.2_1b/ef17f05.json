  "output": "To create this atmospheric image, imagine walking through a lushly forested site at dusk, where misty rain drapes itself over ancient ruins like a mystical shroud. As the raindrops mingle with moss-draped stones and pooling waters, the air is filled with an eerie silence punctuated only by the soft patter of raindrops on crumbling frescoes and the whispers of secrets lost in time. The color palette is muted, with deep blues and purples dominating the scene as the fading light of day converges with twilight, casting long shadows across the ruins, rendering each stone, column, or structure bathed in an haunting luminosity that seems to whisper tales of a bygone era - evoking mystery and nostalgia for any who dare to stand within this mystical realm.",

  "complianceText": "The output is a detailed and artistic description of an image, focusing on a forested site at dusk with ancient ruins. It covers the subjects and their characteristics, such as misty rain and moss-covered stones. The timing and lighting are adequately described with references to dusk and twilight, and a color palette of deep blues and purples is mentioned. The background, setting, and atmosphere are laid out in detail, evoking a feeling of mystery and nostalgia. The output is crafted within a single paragraph and in English; however, it exceeds 80 words. The description explicitly mentions that the description should not exceed 80 words, hence the output does not comply.\n\nERR"
