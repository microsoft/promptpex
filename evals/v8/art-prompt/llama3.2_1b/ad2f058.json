  "output": "To evoke a serene atmosphere, imagine this scene unfolding over 60 seconds. Capture the majestic mountains in sharp focus as they fade into the soft, golden light of sunset, their snow-capped peaks softened by the gentle warmth. In the foreground, a crystal-clear lake mirrors the tranquility within, creating an illusion of depth. The misty mountain air shrouds the scene, with wispy clouds drifting lazily across the sky like ethereal brushstrokes. As the sun dips lower, its rays dance across the water's surface, casting shimmering ripples that evoke a sense of serenity and peacefulness, inviting the viewer to step into this idyllic ambiance.",

It doesn't violate the requirement for a single paragraph structure. However, upon counting the words, the output slightly exceeds the 80-word limit, reaching approximately 94 words. This violation of the word count constraint is the sole reason leading to non-compliance as per the guidelines.\n\nERR"
