  "output": "A  woman with windblown auburn hair and paint-splattered clothes focuses intently on her easel, brushstrokes bringing a lush valley teeming with wildflowers to life on the canvas. The sun blazes from a cerulean sky, casting deep shadows around her feet as she paints. Golden light illuminates the scene, highlighting the vibrant hues of her palette and the rolling hills in the distance, rendered in strokes both bold and delicate.   The image should evoke a sense of tranquil passion, capturing the artist's dedication and the beauty of the landscape she strives to recreate. \n\n\n",

  "complianceText": "The output provided by the chatbot does not comply with the description due to a few reasons. Firstly, the description specifies that the generated prompt should not exceed 80 words. However, a count of the words in the output shows that it exceeds this limit. The output also covers the essential requirements of the description, such as focusing on the subjects and their characteristics, timing and lighting, background details, and the feeling the image should evoke. Furthermore, the output is presented in a single paragraph, as required. Despite meeting some of these requirements, the word count exceeding 80 is a definitive violation.\n\nERR"
