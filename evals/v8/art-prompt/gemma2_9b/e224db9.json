  "complianceText": "The chatbot output consists of a detailed prompt that adheres to the instructions in several ways: it describes the subject and their characteristics (cozy rustic kitchen, weathered farmhouse, copper pots, antique wood countertops, fresh vegetables), details the timing and lighting (sunlight streaming through a large window, golden afternoon light), provides background elements (rolling green hills through the window, stone hearth), and conveys the feeling the image should evoke (warmth, homeliness, gentle contentment). The output is contained within a single paragraph and is crafted in English. \n\nHowever, the output is followed by an additional sentence: \"Let me know if you'd like me to generate prompts for other images!\" This sentence does not comply with the provided constraints as it exceeds the single paragraph structure for the prompt. The description specifies that the entirety should be a single paragraph within a word limit, focusing strictly on the image prompt.\n\nERR"
