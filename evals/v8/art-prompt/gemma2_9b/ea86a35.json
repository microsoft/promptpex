Rain falls softly, each drop creating shimmering puddles that distort the cityscape behind them. The sky is a deep indigo, punctuated by  starry clusters that barely pierce through the gloom.  Electric streetlights cast warm, hazy glows on buildings draped in mist, exuding an atmosphere of quiet melancholy and peaceful solitude as if time itself has slowed under the drizzle.  \n\n\n",
