  "input": "Gentle rain falls over a bustling city street at night, casting reflections and moodiness.",
  "validityText": "The input is a single sentence, forming a single paragraph complying with the specification. It describes a setting - a bustling city street at night, along with the gentle rain, indicating both timing ('at night') and lighting ('reflections'). The input describes the background with the mention of a 'bustling city street.' The characteristic of the scene is highlighted by 'gentle rain,' though it focuses more on the setting than a specific subject and their characteristics. However, the feeling the image should evoke is moody, as suggested by \"moodiness.\" The input does not specify any subjects and predominantly lacks focus on subjects and their characteristics as per the requirements of the specification. Therefore, despite it complying with most other criteria, the lack of focus on subjects and their characteristics renders this non-compliant.\n\nERR",

  "coverageText": "Create an image capturing a lively city street under a gentle evening rain. The street is aglow with vibrant reflections from streetlights, storefronts, and passing cars. The scene is illuminated by the soft glow of overhead lamps and diffused neon lights, casting a moody yet serene ambiance. The wet asphalt mirrors the scattered lights, adding depth to the view. The image should evoke a sense of contemplation and quiet admiration amidst urban busyness.",
