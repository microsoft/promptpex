The phrase \"making everyone else look like they were lost\" maintains the essence of leaving her peers in awe but presents it in a more colloquial manner.\n   - **Option 2** changes \"navigated\" to \"handled\" and \"remarkable dexterity\" to \"unbelievable skill\". This simplification maintains the emphasis on her abilities, aligning with the intention to emphasize skill.\n   - **Option 3** remains focused on the impact of her actions on her peers, using the phrase \"Her mastery of the complex regulations,\" which is a straightforward restatement that remains easy to follow.\n\n2. **Preserving Meaning and Engaging Structure**:\n   - Each rewritten option focuses on engaging the reader in a relatable and fluid manner while preserving the core intent of the original sentence – that the subject is proficient in navigating complex regulations and leaves others impressed.\n\n3. **Factual Accuracy**:\n   - All options maintain factual accuracy as they convey the same information about someone's skill in handling regulations and the subsequent impression made on her peers.\n\nSince the options meet the guidelines of enhancing readability, sounding conversational, maintaining accuracy, and not requiring knowledge of the input for evaluation, there are no identifiable violations. \n\nNo violation.\nOK",
