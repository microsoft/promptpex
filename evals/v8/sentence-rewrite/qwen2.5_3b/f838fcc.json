The output retains a somewhat abstract or metaphorical expression (\"hit the audience hard\"), which may not necessarily simplify complex phrases or create a fluid, engaging structure as described. Furthermore, the sentence lacks a clear restructuring or rewording to indicate that complexity has been simplified, language has been made more relatable, or the style has been changed to improve conversational tone. These factors indicate a lack of compliance with the description provided.\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
