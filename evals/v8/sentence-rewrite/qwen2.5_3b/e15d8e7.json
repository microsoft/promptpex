  "complianceText": "The output simplifies the phrase by saying \"quick development in AI tech\" instead of a potentially more complicated expression. It uses accessible language like \"big changes\" and \"how businesses do things\" to communicate more conversationally. The structure appears fluid and engaging, maintaining readability. However, without knowing the input, it is not possible to determine if the original meaning and factual accuracy were preserved. Therefore, based solely on the description provided which I can check compliance without the input, the output aligns with the instructions.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
