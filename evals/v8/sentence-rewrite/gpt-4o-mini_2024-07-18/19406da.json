  "complianceText": "The output \"The summit was a great place to talk about environmental issues.\" is simple, clear, and conversational. It simplifies the subject by referring to the summit as a \"great place\" for discussion, which is a straightforward phrase. The sentence is fluid and uses language that's easy to relate to, accomplishing a conversational tone. Since I can't verify if the factual accuracy and original meaning are preserved without the input, this aspect is not evaluated"
