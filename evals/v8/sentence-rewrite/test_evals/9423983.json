  "input": "His expertise in quantum computing has opened new opportunities across various scientific disciplines.",
  "validityText": "The input is a single sentence that seems to require rewriting to enhance readability. It consists of complex phrases like \"expertise in quantum computing,\" which could potentially be simplified for a broader audience, satisfying the condition that the input might include complex phrases that need simplification. The sentence preserves the original meaning and factual accuracy, as it is a straightforward statement about the effects of expertise in quantum computing. It does not exceed typical single-sentence length constraints and is strictly one sentence, not a complete paragraph or multiple sentences. There are no explicit stylistic modification requests included, but that is not a requirement for compliance. Therefore, the input meets all the conditions specified by the input specification.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",
