It's concise and understood easily.\n* **\"Critics praising\"** can be simplified to \"reviewers raving,\" adding a bit more impact and energy.  \n*  **\"Stellar performances\"** stays, but it's paired with the simpler \"amazing actors\" for contrast.  \n\n\nLet me know if you have any other sentences you want to polish!",
