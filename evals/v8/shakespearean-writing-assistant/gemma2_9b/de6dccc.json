A simple spread of victuals, perhaps a basket laden with sugared cakes and ruby fruits, doth bring families closer than any castle walls. And what joy to witness young ones chasing butterflies, their faces flushed with happiness! Methinks, 'tis a scene most pleasing and heart-warming. Tell me, does the sun shine brightly upon this merry occasion?   \n",
