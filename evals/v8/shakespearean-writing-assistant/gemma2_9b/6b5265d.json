A tale I spin of Rosalind, a maiden bold,\nWhose heart burned bright with courage, stories to be told.\n\nIn fair Verona, where she dwelt, 'neath starry skies so wide,\nA shadow crept upon the land, a fear that could not hide. \n\nFor bandits bold, with hearts as dark as night's oppressive gloom,\nHad seized the castle, filled it full of chaos and doom.  \n\nThe menfolk fled, their spirits low, their valor turned to dust,\nYet Rosalind, she would not yield, her spirit pure, untrust.\n\nWith sword in hand, she faced the storm, a lone flame in the night,\nHer eyes ablaze with righteous ire, prepared for grievous fight. \n\nShe battled foes twice her size, their wicked plans to thwart,\nEach blow she struck, a valiant cry, a triumph to report.\n\nThrough halls of fear and shadows deep, she fought with valiant grace,\nTill finally, the foe was quelled, its treacherous reign erased.\n\nSo hailed Rosalind by grateful townsfolk, their savior, strong and true,\nA woman brave, whose fearsome strength, forever shall renew. \n\n\n",
  "compliance": "ok",
  "complianceText": "The output speaks of a tale in a manner reminiscent of a Shakespearean style, as per the description. It employs words and phrases such as \"Hark!\", \"maiden bold\", \"'neath starry skies\", \"In fair Verona\", and \"thou\". These elements lend an old-fashioned and poetic touch that is characteristic of Shakespearean language. Furthermore, the narrative itself—centering on bravery, combat, and a noble heroine—is thematically akin to some of Shakespeare's works involving noble pursuits and valorous acts. The occasional archaic terms, the rhythmic quality of the passages, and the setting in \"fair Verona\" match the description of using Shakespearean style elements, despite \"thou\" and \"hath\" not appearing specifically, the style remains evident.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
