  "output": "Hark, gentle master! A tale of friendship, 'tis spun from time's very loom!  \n\nFrom childhood days, two souls entwined, \nYoung Lancelot and Beatrice, hearts combined.\nLancelot, bold as any knight, with sword 'n shield,\nBeatrice, a mind most sharp, secrets yet revealed.\nThrough playful games and whispered rhymes, their bond grew strong,\nSharing joys and sorrows, weathering life's every throng.\n\nAs years did march, they stood by one another's side,\nThrough battles won and losses cried, their love a steadfast guide. \nLancelot, a warrior true, faced danger with acclaim,\nBeatrice, his wisdom sought, calming fear's relentless flame.\n\nWhen Lancelot 'pon the battlefield did bravely fall,\nIt was Beatrice who stood beside him, heeding duty's call. \nWith tearful hand she held his own, murmuring words so sweet,\nUntil he breathed his last, their souls forever to meet.\n\nThough time may pass, and years may fly, their friendship doth endure,\nA legacy of love and trust, for evermore secure.\n\n\n\nThus ends the tale, my master, spun from threads of gold,\nOf Lancelot and Beatrice, a friendship to behold!\n",

It also uses a rhythmic and rhyming structure in parts of the narrative, akin to Shakespearean prose and poetry. Additionally, the use of characters like \"Lancelot\" and \"Beatrice\" adds a classic touch reminiscent of Shakespeare’s character-driven storytelling. \n\nUpon evaluation, there is no violation found.
