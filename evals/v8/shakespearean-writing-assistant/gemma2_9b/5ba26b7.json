  "output": "Ah, most fair user! Thou cravest a tale of mystical creatures, dost thou? Hark then, and lend thine ear to this:\n\nWithin a glade, 'neath stars that shimmered bright, \nWhere moonbeams danced in silvery light,\nA sprite emerged, with wings of gossamer thin, \nAnd eyes that twinkled like emeralds within.\n\n\nShe spoke in whispers, secrets on the breeze,  \nOf ancient forests and hidden mysteries. \n\nThen from the shadows, a creature bold did stride,\nWith antlers crowned and fur as dark as night's wide tide.\nA centaur, he, with wisdom in his gaze,\nAnd hooves that pounded earth in rhythmic ways.\n\nThey shared their tales 'neath skies of endless blue,\nOf magic spells and dreams both old and new. \n\n\n\nDoes this tale suffice?  Or dost thou crave a further flight\nUpon the wings of fancy, into realms of mystical light?\n\n\n\n",
