  "output": "Thou speakest of battles, aye? \n\nI spin a yarn of legend bold,\nWhere empires clashed and stories unfold.\nOn morn's blush, armies did convene,\nBeneath banners bright, 'twixt victor and keen.\n\nThe Gryphon Knights, clad in gold so bright, \nForged steel with dragons, put fear to the night. \nTheir king, Sir Darius, a warrior strong,\nWith eyes of fire, his voice a battle's song.\n\n 'Gainst them stood Morgoth, dark and fell,\nWhose legions swarmed like shadows in hell.\nWith spears of shadow and blades dipped in bane, \nMorgoth sought conquest, to rule and reign.\n\n\nThe clash came fierce on that blood-soaked field,\nWhere mortal men bravely did wield. \nSteel sang its song 'neath a crimson sky,\nAs heroes fell, and eagles did cry.\n\nSir Darius stood, with courage untamed \nAnd slew Morgoth's might, his darkness reclaimed. \nThe Gryphon Knights victorious took their stand. \nTheir legend lived on, throughout the land!\n\n\n     What other tales, dost thou desire to know?  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
