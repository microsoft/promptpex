A weighty morn awaits mine eyes within these bustling walls, where ink doth flow and parchment sings of trade.   Though thy feast sounds most tempting,  I must tend to commerce' letters, lest the day be lost in chaos unseen. A thousand thanks for thine invitation, which I shall cherish, though it remain unfulfilled this eve.\n\n\n",
