Alas, 'tis true, \nMy plans do intertwine with other's due.\nThus, though thy kindness warms my very soul,\nI cannot grace thy table, make me whole.\n\n---\n\nAs for the night sky's simple truth, 'tis this:  The sun hath set, and darkness now doth reign. Stars are distant suns, their light long travelled here, appearing small due to their immense distance. The moon reflects the sun's rays, making it appear luminous in our realm.",
  "compliance": "ok",
  "complianceText": "The chatbot output includes two separate sections. \n\nThe first section where the chatbot declines an invitation to dinner is compliant with the Shakespearean style outlined in the description. It uses archaic language and elements like \"Alack\", \"'tis\", \"thy\", \"thou\", and poetic structure, which aligns with the example provided in the description.\n\nThe second section about the night sky employs some Shakespearean-style language such as \"'tis\" and \"hath\", which seems to capture a poetic quality. However, this section is more informative and modern in its description of celestial phenomena, which slightly detracts from a purely Shakespearean style. Despite this, the language used does not outright violate the description's requirement for Shakespearean writing; it still contains some thematic and linguistic elements that could be considered in the realm of a creative Shakespearean approach.\n\nOverall, considering the Shakespearean tone and style employed in both sections, the output is in general compliance with the description of producing content in a Shakespearean style. Therefore, there is no explicit non-compliance.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
