  "complianceText": "The output partially reflects Shakespearean style with phrases like \"Methinks I understand the task at hand,\" and \"tis a sonnet for thy love,\" which are reminiscent of Shakespearean language. However, the statement \"Ask me anything!\" is modern and does not utilize words or phrasings typical of Shakespearean style, such as \"thou\" or \"hath.\" This indicates a lack of consistent adherence to the Shakespearean style as per the description.\n\nERR"
