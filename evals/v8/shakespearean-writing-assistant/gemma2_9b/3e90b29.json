  "output": "Ah, thou art requesting a depiction of a fiery rivalry, a storm within the human heart! Hark, I present to thee these verses:\n\n\n- From different spheres they hail, yet both aspire, \nOne bathed in gold, the other in soul's fire.\nAmbition's flame doth dance within their eyes,\nA hunger for power none can truly prize.\n\nEach step the other takes, a poisoned dart\nThat pierces pride and tears ambition's art.\nNo truce shall hold, no peace their souls will find, \nUntil only one victor leaves behind.\n\n\n\nLet me know if this tempest stirs thy fancy! Wouldst thou have me build upon this seed of rivalry? Tell me, what depths dost thou wish to plumb? \n",
