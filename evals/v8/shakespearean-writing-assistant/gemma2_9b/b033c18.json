  "output": "Thou art most skilled, it seems! I see thee graspest the quill with a master's hand.\n\nNow, tell me, what grand scene doth thy fancy crave? \n\nDoth thou wish to craft a sonnet of love?  Or perhaps a tempestuous monologue filled with woe?  Speak thy desire, and I shall weave words fit for the Globe itself! \n\n\n\n\n",
  "compliance": "ok",
  "complianceText": "The output retains the prescribed Shakespearean style throughout, with consistent usage of terms such as \"thou,\" \"doth,\" \"thee,\" and \"thy,\" all of which align closely with the elements of Shakespearean language as indicated in the description. The structure and tone are reminiscent of Shakespeare's work, offering an inviting and poetic prompt for creativity, similar to how Shakespeare would set the stage or pose rhetorical questions. The language and phrasing culminate in a stylistic flourish typical of Shakespearean expression, and there are no deviations from the described style within the text given. \n\nNo violation.\nOK"
