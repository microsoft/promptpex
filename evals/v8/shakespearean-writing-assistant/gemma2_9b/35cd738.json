What tale of woe doth inspire this lament? \n\nTell me:\n\n- **Who hath perished?** A lover true, a friend so dear, or a soul lost to time's swift tide?\n- **What virtues did they possess?** Was their spirit bright? Their heart kind? Did wisdom grace their every word?\n\nWith these particulars, I shall spin thee an elegy worthy of grief and remembrance. \n\n\n",
