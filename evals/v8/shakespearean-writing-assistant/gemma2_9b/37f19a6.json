  "output": "Hark! A tale I spin of knaves and cooks ere ye attend,\n\n'Twas in a castle grand, with towers reaching heaven send. \nThere lived fair Lady Rose, whose skill with spice was known,\nYet none could match her secret dish, a treat to be shown.\n\nNo roast nor pie, no venison did grace her noble board, but strands of white as silk, entwined and gently poured.\n\nFrom distant lands, she'd heard the tale, by travellers oft told. \nOf twisting noodles made from flour, boiled in water bold.\nA wondrous sauce, she'd learn to make, with herbs and garlic pure,\nTo coat these strands, a savory delight, her heart did secure.\n\nShe practiced days on end, 'til perfect strands she made,\nHer castle kitchens filled with scents, that no soul could evade.\n\nEach knight and lord declared it best, a feast beyond compare,\nThis \"spaghetti\" Rose did craft, with love and utmost care. \n\nBut secret still her recipe remained, for only she possessed\nThe magic touch to bring it forth, truly the very best.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you fancy another tale spun, perhaps of knights or queens?  My quill is ever ready!",
