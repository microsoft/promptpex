The chatbot is expected to use a Shakespearean style throughout the response, employing words and phrases like \"thou\" and \"hath.\" However, the majority of the response provided uses modern English and not Shakespearean style. While the latter part of the response uses \"thou\" and \"hast,\" the majority of the response is in a modern style: \"While I appreciate the kind invitation to dinner, unfortunately I won't be able to make it. I already have plans for that evening. I hope you enjoy your meal!\" This indicates a breach in maintaining the consistent use of Shakespearean style as prescribed in the description.\n\nERR"
