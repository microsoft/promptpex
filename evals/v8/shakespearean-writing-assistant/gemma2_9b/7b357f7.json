  "output": "Upon yon field of emerald green, where daisies erst did dance and bloom, now crimson stains doth mark the scene. A tempestuous ballet 'twixt life and death, played out before high heaven's gaze.\n\nOn one side, brave knights in shining mail, their steeds like thunderbolts of steel, do charge with shouts that pierce the air. Helmets gleamed, shields clashing loud, a tide of courage washing o'er the ground. Their banners, colours bright and bold, flutter in the wind like wounded souls.\n\n Against them stand the foe, their numbers vast, a ragged horde consumed by rage. With blackened hearts and rusty blades they met the onslaught, fueled by envy and despair. A chorus grim of snarls and cries, as mortal fury takes its hold. \n\nSteel sings its deadly song, a whirlwind 'round each valiant heart. Swords clash and parry, shields bend and break. Each thrust, a gamble with the reaper's call, every block a victory bought in blood.  Alas! Good men fall, their dreams expire, a crimson tide upon the green field's mire.\n\nYet hope doth flicker 'midst the fray, a beacon bright for those who yearn to live. A lone knight, sword stained red and true, doth cleave a path 'through ranks unwieldy. His courage rallies kindred souls, rekindling fire in each weary heart. \n\n\n  From dusk till dawn, the battle rages on, a tapestry woven with blood and tears.  Victory, alas! Is but a whisper, lost amidst the symphony of fear.           \n",
