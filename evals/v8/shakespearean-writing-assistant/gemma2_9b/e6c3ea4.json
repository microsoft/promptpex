The wind doth moan a mournful tune,\nAnd leaves like teardrops fall from branches sere.\nMy heart, a cage where sorrow finds its bloom,\nDoth echo 'neath this sky of darkened cheer.\n\nThe sun hath set, and twilight claims the land,\nA veil of grey upon my spirits falls.\nNo laughter sweet doth grace this lonely strand,\nJust silent tears that stain these furrowed walls.\n\nO cruel fate, why dost thou mar my bliss?\nAnd leave me here to wander in despair?\nThis heavy cloak of grief I cannot miss,\nA constant weight borne 'neath the moon's cold stare.\n\n\n\nLet me sing a verse, and let it be\nA balm for pain, though small its efficacy.   \n",
