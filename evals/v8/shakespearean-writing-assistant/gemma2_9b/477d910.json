A lie doth twist thine tongue! \nThis land doth rightfully answer to my call, \nThrough ancient treaties, oaths thus formally sung,\nIt's mine to rule, by law and standing tall.\n\n **Lord Auberon:**\n\nTreaties forged in shadows, I proclaim,  \nBy whispers traded, secrets bought and sold,\nThy claim is weak, built on deceit's dark flame,\nMy lineage proves its rightful story told! \n\n**Lord Valerian:**\n Lineage fading with each passing day,\nWhile my power grows, as vines entwining rise!\nThis land seeks strength, not whispers come to play, \nTo rule it now, 'tis I who rightfully shall prize!\n\n\n\n",
