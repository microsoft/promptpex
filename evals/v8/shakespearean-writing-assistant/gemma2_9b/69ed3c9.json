With sails unfurled against thy doom!\nLost in the ocean's vast domain, a watery grave doth thee attain. \n\nThe storm clouds gathered, dark and grim, the waves rose high, both fierce and dim.\nThe sailors fought with all their might, but darkness swallowed fading light.\n\n(Chorus)\nO, ship forlorn, where dost thou roam?  With sails unfurled against thy doom!\nLost in the ocean's vast domain, a watery grave doth thee attain. \n\nNow silence reigns where laughter sprung, and ghostly echoes softly sung.\nThe sea hath claimed her sunken prize, beneath cerulean, mournful skies.\n\n\n Let me know if thou desirest more stanzas, good sir or madam!",
