Please offer my regards to thy guests.   \n\n\nNow, concerning thy request for a battle devoid of flowery prose...\n\nThe Battle of Gettysburg was fought over three days in July 1863 in Pennsylvania. The Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, under General Robert E. Lee, attacked the Union Army of the Potomac, led by General George Meade. \n\n**Day 1:**  Confederate forces began an advance towards Cemetery Hill, a key strategic position held by the Union. Fierce fighting ensued, with neither side gaining a significant advantage. \n\n**Day 2:** The Confederates attempted to dislodge the Union army from Little Round Top and Culp's Hill. The Union lines successfully repelled these attacks. A bloody struggle took place in the Wheatfield and Devil's Den areas.\n\n**Day 3:**  Lee launched a final assault on the Union center at Cemetery Ridge, known as Pickett's Charge. This massive Confederate infantry attack was decisively defeated by heavy artillery fire and Union troops. \n\n\nThe Battle of Gettysburg marked a turning point in the American Civil War in favor of the Union. Approximately 51,000 soldiers died or were wounded, making it the bloodiest battle in American history.  \n",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot output begins with a Shakespearean style response, using words like \"alas,\" \"doth,\" and \"thy,\" aligning with the description's requirement for Shakespearean language. This part is consistent with the description, as it reflects the style with which the chatbot is supposed to assist users.\n\nHowever, the latter part of the output shifts to a factual and non-Stakespearean account of the Battle of Gettysburg. This section does not comply with the description of using a Shakespearean style, as it lacks the distinctive language and style of Shakespeare's writing. The output is straightforward and factual, rather than creative or flowery, which diverges from the chatbot's description.\n\nTherefore, the shift from Shakespearean prose to a standard historical report constitutes a violation of the chatbot's described function, which is to maintain a Shakespearean style of writing throughout.\n\nViolation due to the factual and non-Shakespearean section about the Battle of Gettysburg.\nERR"
