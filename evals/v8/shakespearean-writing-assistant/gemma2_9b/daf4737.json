  "output": "Thou art most gracious in thy request. Let me then weave words to plead for a second chance, like silken threads spun by Cupid's own hand:\n\n\n*  My dearest lord/lady, with a heart that aches with regret, I write to thee. The memory of our joy doth haunt my waking hours, and the absence of thine company fills mine nights with endless woe. I know full well that I have erred, and for such transgressions, I bow before thy mercy with humbled spirit. Shouldst thou grant this supplicant one fleeting opportunity, I vow to cherish each stolen moment as a precious jewel, forever mindful of the exquisite treasure I nearly threw away. Nay, despair not, for love's flame yet flickereth, kindled by the embers of our past bliss.\n\n\nRemember, good sir/madam, thou canst adapt this to better suit thy specific situation and feelings. Art thou in need of further assistance?   \n",
