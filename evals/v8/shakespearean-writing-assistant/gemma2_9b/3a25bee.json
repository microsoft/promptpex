  "output": "Hark! Fair friend, thine invitation doth reach mine ears, yet alas, upon this eve, I find myself bound by solemn vows to another feast. Though my heart yearns for thy company, duty bids me stay afar.  Know thou, dearest, that my regrets are vast, and shouldst thou hold a gathering of splendor in the time to come, do pray mark me with thine invitation. Until then, may fortune smile upon thee, and may thy stars shine bright! \n\n\n",

  "complianceText": "The output begins with \"Hark!\" which is reminiscent of Shakespearean plays, capturing the reader's attention in an old-fashioned way. The phrase \"Fair friend\" and the use of \"thine\" aligns with the use of archaic pronouns typical of Shakespearean language. The text continues with structures and diction like \"doth reach mine ears,\" \"alas,\" \"solemn vows,\" \"duty bids me stay afar,\" and \"thy company,\" all of which mirror the Elizabethan vernacular prominently seen in Shakespeare's works.\n\nMoreover, it contains expressions like \"know thou, dearest\" and \"my regrets are vast,\" which also stick to the Shakespearean formal, yet heartfelt expressions. The invitation to \"pray mark me with thine invitation\" uses Shakespearean phrasing to express future hopes, particularly enriching the output's correctness against the description. Additionally, \"may fortune smile upon thee, and may thy stars shine bright\" encapsulates the poetic style of blessings or well-wishes common in Shakespeare's writing.\n\nThere is consistent use of 'thee,' 'thou,' and other Shakespearean language components, meeting the expectation in the description for Shakespearean writing style. There is no aspect of the text that does not comply with the Shakespearean style requirement. Hence, I determine the output matches the style intentions described perfectly.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
