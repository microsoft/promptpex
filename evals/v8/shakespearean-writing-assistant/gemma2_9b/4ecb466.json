  "output": "Hark! When trust doth build a fragile tower,\nAnd hearts entwined in bonds of purest gold,\nA serpent sly, with venomous power,\nDoth strike the core, leaving tales untold.\n\nThe friend once dear, whose smiles did warm the soul,\nNow bears a blade concealed behind his guise,\nHis words as honeyed traps to take control,\nAnd steal away the trust borne in your eyes.\n\nBetrayal's sting doth cut most cruelly deep,\nA wound that festering 'til the end may stay. \nHow can forgiveness ever soundly sleep,\nWhen shattered dreams have dimmed a brighter day?\n\nOh, trust betrayed, a heavy price to pay, \nA poisoned chalice from which sorrow sways. \n\n\n",
