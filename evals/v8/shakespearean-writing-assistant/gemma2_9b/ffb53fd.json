  "output": "Hark! Mine heart doth beat a weary drum,\nFor one who knoweth not her worth, 'tis true.\nHer gaze, a star that shineth bright and glum,\nBeameth upon another, blind to moo.\n\nMy sighs, like summer winds, doth softly blow,\nYet find no shelter in her loving eye.\nA captive in this cage of love's woe,\nI pines for her, whilst others pass me by.\n\nThis yearning soul, with chains of passion bound,\nDoth watch her dance, a distant melody.\nIn dreams alone, her touch I have found,\nBut waking brings the ache of misery.\n\n\n",
