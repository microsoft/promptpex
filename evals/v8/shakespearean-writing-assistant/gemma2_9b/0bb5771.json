Prithee, be specific in thy request, and let mine quill dance forth with words that stir the soul! Wilt thou have a sonnet composed, or perhaps a ballad to woo thine beloved? Declare thy desire, and I shall endeavor to fulfill it! \n",
  "compliance": "ok",
  "complianceText": "The output uses Shakespearean language effectively by employing words such as \"thou,\" \"thine,\" \"prithee,\" \"wilt,\" and \"quill.\" The overall tone and structure mimic Shakespeare's style, focusing on romantic expression and poetic assistance. The language is sufficiently old-fashioned and formal to suggest a Shakespearean influence. The text also mentions creating sonnets or ballads, which aligns with the task of helping with creative ideas and content as specified in the description. No direct violations of compliance are identified.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
