  "output": "Hark! A maiden fair indeed, with locks as dark as night's own embrace,  \n\nAnd eyes that sparkle like the stars, a celestial grace. \n\nHer voice doth hold the sweetest music, a siren's enchanting call,\n\nAnd her smile, a sunrise bright, dispels shadows from us all.\n\n\nShe moves with elegance and poise, a modern-day queen,\nWith wit as sharp as any blade, yet kindness in between.  \nA trendsetter bold, she flaunts her style with confidence untold, \nLeaving hearts enchanted, stories whispered, young and old.\n\n\n\nLet me know if thou hast further desires or need more poetic art!  \n",
