  "output": "Hark! The great hall vibrates with anticipation. A hush descends as the procession enters, led by a throng of nobles in velvet and lace.  Before them walks a figure draped in crimson cloth – the newly crowned King Alexander. \n\nUpon the raised dais, an Archbishop waits, a golden orb held aloft. \"By authority vested in me,\" he proclaims, his voice booming through the chamber, \"I anoint thee King, Alexander! Defender of Faith and Protector of these Lands!\" Oil flows from a silver vessel onto Alexander's brow as the crowd erupts in thunderous cheers. He kneels before the altar, his face grave with the weight of his new responsibility. \n\nThe Archbishop then presents him with the crown – a magnificent artefact of gold and jewels, shimmering in the candlelight. With trembling hands, King Alexander lifts it onto his head. The weight feels heavy, but within his eyes, a spark of resolve ignites.\n\n\"God Save the King!\" roars the crowd in unison.  Musicians strike up a triumphant melody, filling the hall with joyous sound. Noble families curtsey and bow as King Alexander rises to meet their gaze. His first smile hints at the man beneath the king – kind, but unwavering in his duty. The coronation is complete, and a new era has begun. \n\n\n",

The description effectively captures the atmosphere of a past time, using detailed imagery and ceremonial descriptions typical of Shakespeare's writings. While it doesn't heavily use words like \"thou\" and \"hath,\" the structure and flow are reminiscent of Shakespeare's work. Overall, the style is consistent with the description provided.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
