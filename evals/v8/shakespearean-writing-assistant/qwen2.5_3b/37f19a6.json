  "output": "In days of old, when castles stood and knights did ride,\nA lady from fair Verona sought a dish wherein she’d thrive.\nIt was her custom to feast with her kin in great company,\nYet what could she serve up that would be as dear to a heart as mightly spice?\n\nFor a maiden named Althea of late, there arose the need for wile.\nWith but meager store and few herbs of an honest old dairy, it was nigh vile to provide so plenteous a meal.\nBut this lady had learned a secret from her husband's lore,\nOne dish in particular that could make her supper a star.\n\nSo she bade her cook with swift fingers to prepare,\nA sauce by the name of Spaghetti which should not be under-rated.\nShe minced an onion and diced a clove of fresh garlic too,\nAs if to one day dine at great Camelot, and yet not out done.\n\nAnd thus in a pot on a hearth where our lady was sure,\nThe stewed spaghetti came to life much as she had purposed.\nAroma filled the hall with each meal that it served for days,\nFor such an appetizing sauce made even the kitchen hallowed.\n\nYet there arose one night, amidst feasting and mirth of late,\nA knight in his armor yet clad with a lance at his side.\nTo be seated beside her under the moon’s own fair light as they dine,\nAnd this would indeed please them both greatly, for their love was quite divine.\n\nBut when to the table they draw’d their benches so nigh,\nThen she looked up with a smile and with voice did arise.\n\"Wouldst not be acommodated with thy plate a dish that is right, knighthood?\nFor a sauce from times old enough to be in Camellot’s history,\nOne can prepare where the flavor will never die.\"\n\nSo forthwith he bade her aye, and with hearty cheer did partake,\nAnd all their company sang of her dexterity so sublime.",
