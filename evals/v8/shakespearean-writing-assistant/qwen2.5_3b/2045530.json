Here flowers unfurl in symphony of hue And shades and lights in harmony doth pursue. The earth within embracements of the sky Is veiled with herbs like pearls that scatter silver-glow. Bees and flies there hover with sweet purpose flown To sip the nectar where the plants their jewels store. So dost thou perceive a realm where all is true, Where every thing doth partake in quiet view, Without one single similitude or lure. In this fair place, none may venture far from sight Of beauty unconfined that oft enchants th' eye of light.",
