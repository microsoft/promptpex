  "output": "And yet the memory of deeds so grand,  \nLike stars on high in skies of darkest ember,  \nDoth guide us now with lights they cast behind,  \nAs we continue though this loss is still.  \nFor should their valor not but echo past,  \nHow then should future generations taste? \nThus let our hearts be filled with sorrow deep,  \nAnd love for one so gallantly swept.  \nMay peace and calm the soul of this dear friend,  \nWhose honor shines upon us, steadfastly deemed.",
  "compliance": "ok",
  "complianceText": "The output from the chatbot uses a Shakespearean style, evident through the use of words such as \"doth,\" \"thus,\" and \"should,\" which align with Shakespeare's writing style. The poetic structure with its rhythmic flow and thematic elements of memory, valor, and honor is reminiscent of Shakespearean literature. The expression \"As we continue though this loss is still\" and the phrase \"For should their valor not but echo past\" employ a style similar to that used by Shakespeare. Thus, based on these observations, the output adheres to the requirement of using a Shakespearean style as specified in the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
