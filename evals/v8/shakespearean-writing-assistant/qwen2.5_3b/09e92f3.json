  "output": "- Upon life's vast expanse, doth man inquire:  \nWhat is the essence, this dark, vexing strife?  \nIs it in earthly goods, within sweet delights,  \nOr from profound knowledge that all minds prize?\n\nTo seek or to serve, to cherish or to know,  \nShall one find solace where their hearts abide?  \n'Tis a riddle that betwixt the ages flies,  \nA quest for wisdom, this eternal fire.\n\nThus wandereth each man upon the earth,  \nEach soul a seeker on life’s path unknown;  \nWith purpose deep within the heart's domain,  \nSeeking in shadows and in stars to learn.",
