  "output": "And in thy company, he did gently nigh,  \nHis hooves upon the daisied earth they lie,  \nHis horn of amethyst so finely shaped,  \nDoth echo with a note of purest banded rhar.\n\nThe sprites and sidhe then do in twilights air appear,  \nWith shimmering locks that sparkle all alight in sapphire tear;  \nTheir voices soft as whispers gentle to the ears,\nIn harmonies profound they sing their lore of old.  \n\nTherefore, if this fantastical fable's tale dost please,  \nI humbly pray thee let me be the one whom fate hath singly chose,  \nTo lead you unto realms beyond both sense and ken,  \nWhere wondrous creatures dance and all is sweet content.",
