  "complianceText": "The output largely adheres to the Shakespearean style as described. It uses rich imagery and words associated with Shakespearean language, such as \"hath,\" and provides a poetic form reminiscent of Shakespeare's works. However, it lacks some specific words like \"thou\" from the example list, although the specific omission of \"thou\" is not explicitly stated as a requirement.\n\nFurthermore, the composition presents an old English touch in the language, evident in such phrases as \"'Tis not needful\" and \"array hath no lack of grace.\" The style and tone are consistent with the Shakespearean form. Therefore, the absence of the specific word \"thou\" alone does not violate the description. \n\nNo violation.\nOK"
