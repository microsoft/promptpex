  "output": "And in this tale, a realm once lush doth plight –  \nKing Arthur's land in peril stands the mightiest fight.  \nFierce foes from lands afar their wrath confute,  \nBy Merlin's counsel sought in hidden, wondrous root.\nThe Round Table rings with fervor all are set,  \nA quest to slay the Minotaur and save our state;  \nIn Eternity of struggle doth they entreat –  \nFor Arthur’s crown and the eternal bliss bet.\n\nThe First, a knight named Lancelot from Valour springs,  \nWith courage staunch as heart that beats within him.  \nHis steed he rides like tempest winds under bright skies,  \nAnd Arthur to this brave and noble man confers.\n\nThen next comes Sir Gawain of gentle wit,  \nBy Guinevere's side his dexterity doth sit.  \nTo arms they go before the battle loud and stern –  \nIn battle’s strife the bravest are most dear to me.\n\nThe Minotaur doth from Eternity arise,  \nWith horns unto the clouds that echo like a voice;  \nOf beasts of might it comes as bane or boon indeed,  \nIts horn doth roar on mountains high and valleys deep.\nThis beast is both enchanted with enchanting power –  \nAnd though it seeks no glory, yet its prowess marveleth.\n\nThe fighting then does come, each heart entwined in strife;  \nA gladiatorial bond between the knightly wife.  \nArthur commands them through their fiery trial,  \nTo slay the Minotaur before they all fall still.\n\nOft doth Lancelot charge upon the beast and strike, –  \nHis courage cannot break as his desire doth light.  \nYet strength of armor proves in battle’s direst hour,  \nAnd bravest knights alike are felled by fate's decree.\nThe battle then doth rage like tempests, fierce and loud,  \nIn this great clash the heroes strive without a doubt.\n\nAt last from midst their fury does our Arthur rise –  \nHis keen and righteous sword that shines as bright as skies.  \nIt strikes upon the horns with force as mighty and bold,  \nAs Lancelot's blow his sword did once so greatly fold.\nAnd finally, with one heroic deed doth he succeed,  \nThe beast vanquished, a champion all the kingdom pledges.\n\nFor in these mortal hands resides immortal grace,  \nA tale to echo through an age that lives for ages.",
