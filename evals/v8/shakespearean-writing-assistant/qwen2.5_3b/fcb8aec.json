  "output": "Upon the rugged path that winds aspires,  \nThis vagrancer sets forth with spirit rare.  \nThe sun hath set on realms of old delight,  \nAnd new horizons beckon in his sight.\nThrough forests dark where shadows kiss the air,  \nAnd o'er the waves a tempest doth inspire.  \nIn hearts of strangers he finds paths untrod,  \nFame’s haughty gates remain oft closed and bold.  \nYet, still amidst these lands by fortune spun,  \nHe searches for a spark with which to burn.\nWhere rivers rage in tumultuous array,  \nAnd mountains bear their crags to heaven high,  \nHis heart doth yearn for skies that shall be bright,  \nWhen he hath crossed the paths of those whose light  \nDoth shine upon him from his native home.  \nThere dreams will weave a tapestry to cope,  \nWith colors rich and hues so deep,  \nOf glories past too many a night to keep.\nThus wanderer, in every land doth go,  \nTo seek what fortune hath not chosen for thee.  \nWhate’er the trials or the sorrows befall,  \nThou art upon the road, as thou hast been from hell.",
