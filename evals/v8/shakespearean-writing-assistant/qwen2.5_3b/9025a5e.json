  "output": "Once in days gone by there was a wench named Isabella and in days still to follow was the youth, Michael, whose face shrouded the sun and charmed the moon's light.  \n\nIsabella oft would gaze upon his features as the stars wept with her longing and he dreamed of love that none did speak. Yet she deemed such thralldom a folly and vowed not to let it be.\n\nMichael’s heart thrummed fast with Isabella’s name but how could mortal flesh aspire to feats celestial? Their desire, like fire within the ashes, burned unchecked until its flames obscured reality. They were of different natures joined yet untouchable. \n\nFor love is but a dream and love cannot be had unless we part - their parting then was both sweet release and solemn sorrow. Thus ended Isabella’s youth who met her end in starlight while Michael lived to see another day on earth, yet ever yearned for she whom his love had been.\n\nAnd they are called to this very night, Isabella with stars from heaven fallen into man, he Michael of men by nature pure and still consumed with passions boundless. In their sorrow and desire a tale is told wherein two souls were doomed to sing beneath the star's unspoken song.",
