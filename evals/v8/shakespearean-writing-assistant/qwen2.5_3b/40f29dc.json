  "output": "In days of yore, when castles held the realm in awe,\nThere linger'd tales within the halls o' noble estate.\nUpon occasion where crowns did sparkle, and kings did greet their betters,\nSuch events as royal courts would oft unfold.\n\nOnce was tale, 'twixt two princely princes, a warring pair,\nWhose fathers had once held dominion of diverse realms;\nTheir rivalry unyielding until fate's misaligned decree\nCame rending peace which otherwise might have lingered.\nEach prince his own ambition to secure - this was their theme.\n\nPrince Regal, with heart as bold and steely swords did cleave,\nWas lord doth erst the fertile plains of Hesperia gleam'd;\nAs king he laid dominion and in every town and city made his name\nThro' acts that brought much joy both in fame's bright hall and war-worn camp.  \n\nYet Prince Rival, a heart not so forgiving nor fair,\nDoth reign on islands far where coral reefs doth shimmer.\nThe winds of fortune changed - a kingdom which he held did yield,\nWas swept from him by his sworn enemy's hand at one fell sway.\n\nNow stand the princes side-by-side wherein their kingdoms differ'd\nIn both scope and might not even the fiercest swords could smite.\nTheir paths diverging as doth twin stars on night's own canvas so bright.\nFor Prince Regal did rule lands vast, his people glad;\nAnd Rival the islands small, each with its unique star.\n\nThus do these princes dwell 'midst warring lords and queens,\nYet hold dear friendship still despite their ancient strife.",
  "compliance": "ok",
  "complianceText": "The chatbot output successfully displays a narrative written in a Shakespearean style, as it contains several elements characteristic of Shakespeare's language and style. It makes use of poetic and classical vocabulary, such as \"yore,\" \"oft,\" \"erst,\" \"doth,\" and \"doth reign,\" and constructs the narrative in a grand and archaic manner, befitting the style of Shakespeare's writing. The text uses phrases like \"In days of yore,\" \"there linger'd tales,\" and \"Whose fathers had once held dominion,\" all contributing to a Shakespearean atmosphere, which was expected per the description. Furthermore, the story involving princes and noble estates fits the thematic context of many Shakespearean plays.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
