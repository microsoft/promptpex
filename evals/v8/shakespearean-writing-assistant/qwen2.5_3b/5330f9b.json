  "output": "Moreover, like twin stars to Jupiter aloft,  \nIn harmony we twine our fates entwined,  \nWith each look, heart's joy doth softly mount and flow,  \nAnd though I scarce am bold or brave in verse,  \nMy love's deep thralldom I declare unto thee,  \nBinding me with ties as fragile as a spider weaves its fine conceits.  \nThus thou art not alone nor wilt ever be,  \nFor in thy love there flows an ocean deep and vast,  \nLike rivers of sweet wine, nectareous and unblest.  \nTherefore, permit my sighs to gently stir  \nThy bosom, where my burning heart doth rest,\nAnd let the firefly of my affections wing  \nIts sweetest beams upon thy dainty cheek, my Juliet.",
