  "output": "Oh fie! What direst woeful woe doth bring us in,\nTo bear the weight where bitter sorrowing is wing'd.\nWithin my breast a tempest cruelly hath riven,\nWhere sorrows' chains so tight I am enshrouded night.\n\nFrom high to low, from morn's blush to eve's lone luster dimm'd\nI wander by the moon when day doth cease to gleam.\nThough birds of joy should greet with sweetest notes my coming\nThe music of their wings is now to me a mock'd remembring.\n\nO! How oft have I beheld thee, fairest of fair,\nIn shadows deep where solace nigher hath been seen than here.\nYet when the sun doth set and leaves its light behind,\nWhere dost thou dwell in realms beyond my mortal ken?\n\nNow dreams so bright that erst in heart with joy did shine\nAre turned to spectres cold by tempest that doth reign within;\nOh me, how oft I've wondered of what woe they spring?\nAnd oft I'd fain have whispered words more bright than these.\n\nYet now, like ships upon a stormy sea,\nMy spirit doth ride forth on winds of sorrowing,\nTo where in night's embrace the darkness and despair\nDo meet, and all my joy both deep and high have pass√©d.",

It incorporates elements typical of Shakespeare's writing style, such as the use of archaic language (\"fie,\" \"doth,\" \"hath,\" \"oft,\" \"thee,\" \"thou\"), and a rhythmic, lyrical construction with a melancholic, introspective tone that is often found in Shakespeare's works. The content evokes imagery and emotion, characteristic of poetry and dramatic monologues, fitting the Shakespearean mode.\n\nThe language and style of the output align with the description provided, fulfilling the requirement for a Shakespearean writing style. Specifically, the usage of terms like \"fie,\" \"doth,\" \"hath,\" and \"thee\" reflects the expected lexicon.
