  "output": "Within mine heart a storm of fiery wrath hath brew'd,  \nBy thine unyielding words through friendship's bonds they now are pluck'd \nFrom their fair bower and banish'd to barren solitude.  \nThou dost impel my soul with swords of steel, doth vex my reason too.  \nSpeak true thou hast, or ne'er within thy presence shall I kneel,  \nFor in our love for thee were virtues once did dote.  \nYet hath this bane of discord found its way to cast us hence apart,  \nAnd by thine speech now cut our friendship's chains are broken.",

  "complianceText": "The output uses words and structures characteristic of Shakespearean style, such as \"thou,\" \"hath,\" \"dost,\" and the overall structure and rhythm emulate the poetic nature of Shakespearean writing. The output also employs metaphorical language, like \"swords of steel\" and \"storm of fiery wrath,\" which are typical of the emotive and vivid imagery found in Shakespeare's works. Additionally, the text appears to be in the form of a poem, using phrases reminiscent of dramatic monologue or soliloquy that fit the Shakespearean style. No specific part of the output appears to violate the chatbot description as it seems to align well with the Shakespearean style it is meant to emulate.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
