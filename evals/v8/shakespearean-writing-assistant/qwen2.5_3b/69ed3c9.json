  "output": "Yon masts of yore by waters are arrayed,  \nWhile clouds like darkened spectres do parade,\nWith winds that whisper in the tempest's ear,\nAnd waves that dance on billows' frothy rear.\n\nFrom deck so high where gulls above alight,  \nGazing upon their shadows, light and bright,\nI pray a guiding spirit to impart\nOf peril'd mariner, in need of art.  \n\nIn silver-sailed fleet through seas vast and wide,\nWhere suns and moons on ocean's mirror glide,\nOur ship did sail; it was as I had planned!\nA tempest came with winter-strength and scorn.\nThe skies like darkened sheets were stretched above,\nWhile winds did rage, a furious symphony.\n\nAnd ere that tempest found the weary frame,\nIt hath consumed our hopes as sunnier flame.\nTo those who roam the sea, we ask to pray,\nThat in this fate our ship might thee not stray.\n\nOh waters of so deep and wide and wild,\nWhere many have perished and many died;\nLet us remember thus, with caution bold\nThough nigh unto the very brink to hold.\nThe skies as dark, the winds as fierce and free,\nAnd seas that toss thee far from land do sever.",
