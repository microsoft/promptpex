  "output": "Ay, wouldest thou have an elegy in verse for such unfeigned companionship as maketh men whole who walk by darksome streets with thee and I, thyself like a star that shineth upon the night?\n\nOnce wert thou to me as balm to heale and wine to gladden; so in our times of travail hath not time's wheel turned full ten thousand rounds, save we two steadfast hold together hand in glove.\n\nWithin thy virtues' reach oft did I stray into sweet drowsiness like lovers who with silken fingers press the flesh of summer plums, all sweetness taints them, ere they rise to their rude and sordid uses. In thee have found solace; from strife find heart and peace. As the river bends, yet floweth forth with waters full, even so our thoughts do often veer within a circle that encircles none but ever we twain.\n\nThou, dear friend, hast been my compass in all darkness, thy words the lantern light of wisdom to lead me back to safety when I wander. Though oft ye see no end, yet doth thy promise not forsake, as sure as doth the star that guides us night by night.",
