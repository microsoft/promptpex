  "output": "Within a verdant glen, where brooks did sing, And dappled deer with leaves o'erspread their ring, There was an old wise crab-apple tree alack, That bore no fruit yet bore much wisdom's grange.\nUpon this blessed boughs there sat young Jack, Who oft had said that he would not take his lack. One day fair Isabella did beseech him to be sooth, For she espied in him a wondrous youth.\nSo from the earth Did brave young Jack arise Upon her tender hands And gentle kiss From which arose On high her princely crown With golden chain And jewel-studded gown To show what state Of beauty's maid Hath oft for doting youth.\nBut Jack reparted with a kindly leer, \"Believe me, ma'am it is a fair endeavor To be so great In such a humble seat But I perceive You shall not thus forsake Your high estate To join so lowly company and meet With but an old crab-apple tree.\"\nOft after this Did Isabella miss Her courtship So she did come And with her came A hunk of cheese Which did for him And her both appease.\nThus by the grace Of friendship's tie Was Jack indeed Accepted as a member By Isabella Upon their verdant green Wherein they'd often meet To share and greet.",
