  "output": "And in thy silver kiss, dear moon, Do I find solace for pain, Aye, as a moth doth find the flame That guides its flight unto thine embrace.\nThou art to me like Cupid's arrow True, though my heart within me barrowed With thee, no more is sadness sore But joy and rapture make my soul In tune with celestial hour.  \nAnd thus dost thou my life adorn, A sight of loveliness so fair That love doth not from thee depart But evermore must sing thy praise.",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output largely complies with the description of speaking in a Shakespearean style. It effectively uses Shakespearean-style language with words like \"thou,\" \"doth,\" \"aye,\" and constructions such as \"doth find\" and \"art to me.\" The text has a poetic feel characteristic of Shakespearean writing, with metaphors and expressions of love which are in line with the examples given in the description. There are no specific violations noted that would lead to non-compliance with the description based solely on the provided output.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
