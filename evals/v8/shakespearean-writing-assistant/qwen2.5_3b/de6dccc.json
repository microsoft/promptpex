  "output": "Lo, noble friends and kindred souls, we sit upon this verdant sod, mirth in our hearts and joyousness abound; for to thy bountiful invitation hast I hitherto answered with an eager countenance within my breast. Behold the ripe cherries yet unpressed by pluckers' grasp, ripe peaches as of yore did Nature's craft have set aside for us that feast: what can be finer than such a season ripe in summer-sun?\nThe laughter we shall hear there will indeed make merry any heart alight within itself; our mirth the honeyed fruits and wine, the very air perfumed with balm that heals the sorrow from those who sip but once more upon earth's bounty fair. For so shall it be, we sail together under a sky of joy and hope, beneath an arch where time and place in twilight shade doth part and greet us as by new comers come to bless our lives with sweetest greeting.\nThus, I must return my thine courteous answer: Thou invitest well, for thou hast seen that heart is ready hither; in answer therefore, be it, that we shall meet beneath the boughs of old oak trees or on soft breezy lawns where flowers gently nod to us in gentle adieu. So then farewell my friends, and let this day with a promise of more such meetings come as summer's warm embraces doth bespeak itself upon the earth below.",
