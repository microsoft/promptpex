Amidst this tempest, a beacon loiters bright  \nGuiding us through darkened mists to lands of might.  \nThe hour has struck for valour's ardent display,  \nAnd in our hearts, the fires of ambition smoulder.\nWhat doth fortune bode but fate's decree,  \nShould we falter and leave the prize unclaimed?\nHark! The charge ascends, let each soldier stir,  \nWith hearts aglow with valor's flame, for glory hallow!\nVictory calls us to this solemn fray,  \nFor in our battle cries and valiant day  \nWe bid farewell unto defeat's cold grasp.  \nOur cause is just, and we will see it through!\nThus onward march we towards the fight,  \nEach of us a sword against the foe, and with each stride\nCasting shadows where dismay once lingereth.\nShall fate decree or courage lead the way?  \nThat shall be shown in bloody strife to-day.  \nOur very names shall echo 'midst these clashings bold,  \nAnd honor's light forever after shall outlast the clouded morn.",
