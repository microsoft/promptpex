  "output": "And specters doth glide where shadows play,  \nThrough corridors that time hath not denied.  \nEach room is hung with ghosts who ne'er may stray,  \nTheir footsteps soft in echoes of the night fray.\nIn vaults beneath where deep dark loiters near,  \nLintels bear no light; but ancient whispers eerily declare.  \nBones lie exposed where cobwebs yet remain,  \nAnd shadows veiling still the castle's shame.\nWhere halls once gleamed with pomp and wassail now,\nGhosts of bygone lords that dare not go.\nFor in these walls all terrors do reside,\nA specter haunteth night and day. \nThus dire its place 'midst dark and fickle stars,  \nWith fears for those who dare to tread the portals bars.",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output displays clear compliance with the Shakespearean style as described. The text employs older English terms and phrases, such as \"doth glide,\" \"hath not denied,\" and \"ne'er may stray,\" which are consistent with the stylistic elements of Shakespearean writing. The language is poetic and descriptive, reminiscent of the kind of imagery in Shakespeare's works. It uses formal and evocative language that includes mentions of \"specters,\" \"shadows,\" \"whispers,\" and \"terrors,\" which fits the Shakespearean style of detailed and atmospherically rich narrative. Furthermore, the text is written in a structured and rhythmic fashion, similar to how Shakespeare would compose his sonnets or plays.\n\nThere are no apparent violations of compliance with the description provided. The output seems to faithfully embody the qualities and characteristics of Shakespearean writing without any discernible lapses into a modern vernacular style.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
