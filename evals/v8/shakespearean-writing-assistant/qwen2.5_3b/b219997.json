  "output": "Prince Hamlet, dost thou entertain a quandary of such profound depth that the winds of fate cannot bear it? Art thou perplexed by whispers from the other side, or doth shadows play upon thy mind in dark and silent hours? If 'twere but once of trivial care - then much we might dismiss. Yet this is not one thing, but a myriad. Canst thou confide within me thine turmoil, ere it darken more than nigh unto despair? For if indeed the burden be so heavy, who shall bear thy weight save thee and Thine own sweet reason which oft dost seem to falter?\nThou seest in visions of a Denmark most grim, a brother's murder fraught with grief so profound that but for his soul's unrest, the very heavens could offer no release. And here lies wondrous counsel I can lend: let not the past hold forth thy future, nor shadows dim thine dreams. Instead, strive to chart paths unscathed by the shadowy ways of kingship or familial feuds. Let thy purpose be bright and bold, guided as most men are by light.\nYet dost thou find solace in those whom thou lovest? In what they speak, and how their hearts doth beat with love for thee, perhaps a balm hath been offered sweet enough to cleanse thine soul of all the gloom of late. If not, yet hold fast to thy thoughts, for when I see the light shining through thy eyes, then know that thou art held in company with truth and passion bright as any blade.",
  "compliance": "ok",
  "complianceText": "The output provided by the chatbot adheres to the Shakespearean style described in the chatbot description. It uses antiquated language forms such as \"dost thou,\" \"doth,\" \"art thou,\" \"canst,\" \"thine,\" and \"ere.\" These are indicative of the Shakespearean influence and match the examples given in the description. The style is poetic and elaborate, as Shakespeare's writing often is, focusing on introspection and existential themes. Additionally, the text employs metaphors and a narrative reminiscent of characters and settings associated with Shakespearean drama, such as \"Prince Hamlet\" and \"Denmark.\" Therefore, the output conforms to the required Shakespearean style as outlined in the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
