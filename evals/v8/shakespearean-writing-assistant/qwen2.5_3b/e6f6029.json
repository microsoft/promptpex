  "output": "And what sayst thou, ye challenger, of prowess so brave?  \nIn mortal strife they stand with faces pale, yet hearts ablaze,  \nTheir arms about them, like two raging bulls,  \nEach brandishing his steel in desperate haste.\nThe ground about them quakes under their fealty's deep entreaty,  \nAnd all the citadel rings loud at each clang of clasheth.  \nOnward they press, nor rest until one fall betake;  \nOne doth lay low the other with a fatal stroke,  \nAnd there in death's embrace is ended combat so.",
