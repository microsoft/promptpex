  "output": "Moreover, in each vale beneath the lunar sway,  \nLie treasures bounteous, hidden from the naive.  \nArt thou not bold enough then for distant roam?  \nLet thy heart be as a map, revealing thine own home.\n\nIn paths untried doth valor often lie,  \nAnd shadows of fear are but thyself that shy.  \nFear not those realms where moonlit shadows play,  \nFor in 'twixt stars and light there lies the way to day.\nArt thou ready then for aught beneath the sun?  \nFor such as thee this hand dost call it hath its boon.",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output uses a Shakespearean style of writing, incorporating elements like the older language form seen in \"thou,\" \"dost,\" and \"hath,\" which aligns with the required Shakespearean style. The poetic structure and the use of metaphors and rhetorical questions further suggest adherence to the Shakespearean style. The language choices and sentence structure consistently evoke a style reminiscent of Shakespeare's works. \n\nNo violation.\nOK"
