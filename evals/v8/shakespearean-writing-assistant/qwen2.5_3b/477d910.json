The borders of the fair Danelow Woods have proved most vexing in their uncertainty, and I must say that much good counsel hath been called to our council's attention.\n\nThou dost mention that the Woodland thine ancestors had planted, yet what token hast thou beyond vague reports? Our lands must stand established upon hard proof, not mere supposition. We may claim right fair from thy words for my own forebears cleared and held them in the same ancient time when their deeds were set stone.\n\nHence I say, we may grant thee that certain swathes of land border Danelow Woods might be thine by a reasonable judgement. Yet let us not dispute the rights within its heart that are well-nigh perpetual. For this I must contend, unless thy speech can show otherwise where the very foundations of our rights are concerned.\n\nWhat say thou? Hastes thee to argue with what is settled, or dost thou seek fair from all land to be ours?\n\nI must say my mind doth not rest in such uncertainty. Our very lives are held at stake on just lands and deeds, and I would a judgement that doth not call into endless doubt.\n  \nThou knowest how sacred these matters can be? Thus let us settle this with the weight of our ancestorsâ€™ judgments; then shall we both feel as certain as if their words were cast in iron.",
