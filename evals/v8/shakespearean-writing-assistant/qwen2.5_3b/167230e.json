  "output": "And on her prow did star an emblem vast,  \nA compass pointing bold to all its paths.  \nFrom decks of old and shipmates grim, did she claim,  \n\"For thou shalt sail with me or in naught but shame.\" \nThrice wore the crown of plunder round her brow,  \nIn winds that hailed not mild her power was know'd.  \nTo corsairs' hearts, to corsair lords alike she showed  \nThe face of might where many a heart would hide.\nYet 'neath the watchful eye of seas and stars,  \nA whispered code did guide her steadfast course,  \n\"For thine be treasure found but honor's star,\"  \nThus spoke the lady pirate in sweet despair. \n\nThou seest then Anne in battle not alone,  \nFor each tempest's surge or silver reef,  \nShe was the shipmate who'd hold fast with love and pain,  \nWhere others faltered at a foe’s disdain.\n\nShall we continue this tale 'gainst night's dark waves? \nA lady pirate sworn to sea by force,  \nAnd honor in her heart as she did cleave.  \nIn storms and calm, forever more she stirs.",
