  "output": "Thou art solicitous to ensue the discourse concerning so stately an assembly, whereon the stars themselves would weave their loom in fabrics rare! Harken now, were I to speak of that which ascendeth towards Elysium, wherein fairies dance and Cupids sing; such a feast as pleaseth not the common palate. Yet, should this celestial gathering be esteemed of virtue, thou shouldest prepare thyself with grace, for it is an invitation to matters above mortal scope.",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot speaks in a Shakespearean style, employing archaic words and structures such as \"Thou art solicitous,\" \"whereon,\" \"ascendeth towards Elysium,\" \"such a feast as pleaseth not,\" and \"shouldest prepare thyself.\" These elements are consistent with the Shakespearean writing style described in the task. Hence, there is no violation of the chatbot's description as provided.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
