  "output": "Upon the throne's golden dais,\nWhere regal robes and crown-gilt hearse abide,  \nAn ancient herald doth his trumpet strike:\n\"Awake, O chambers! Feast prepares to-night!\nAt court, where princes gather and attend,\nTo sate themselves with gluttony of good!\"\nAnd thus each lordly pair from other realms,\nOf noble birth and high estate, do make\nTheir paths toward the festal feasts; wherein their hands\nAre filled with meats both rare and rich in dye;\nSweet fruits ensconced in silver bowls they seek.\nIn halls where crystal shines upon them as a gem,\nEach one doth find himself prepared to dine.\nThen comes a servant with fresh wine each lord  \nDoth quaff, his lips with ruby drops bedewed.\nThe lords within their chambers greet the guests:\nHere noble talk about history and state\nDoes float from chamber door to other ear.\nAnd thus in merry feasting as one sayl,\nEach doth partake of meats, all taste they find sweet;\nFor food is given to make man happy here.\nThen comes a lord with pipe and lyre, his song  \nOf joys and troubles sung; the company  \nDoth clap their hands upon his voice's sound.\nThus ends our feast at regal high command.",
