  "output": "In a realm where sorrow doth entwine, And hearts upon the wind they twine,\nThere lies a tale of love regret, Where once a love did seek her sweet,\nUpon the moonlit paths she'd roam, In laughter's bloom and morn, to roam.\nYet time hath passed with whispers cold, And shadows long behind their toll.  \nThe stars've outplayed themselves anew, Their silence bittersweet they knew.\nThus wandereth she under skies of grey, A lone echo in a hollowed sea,\nOf memories that once did bring them joy, Now but a phantom show to pursue.",
