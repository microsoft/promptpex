  "output": "- In the vale where whispers hold their light,  \nHath shadows dance upon the frosty night.  \nAn ancient curse from ages past doth call,  \nA harbinger of doom is on his talisman.  \nWhen moon shall wane, winds shake in dread,\nAnd stars, once gleaming, turn their faces dead.  \nThe veils of what was and what will be,  \nShall part in silent, solemn release.  \nKnow thusly known, a fall to nigh the brink,\nHath dark forebodings hasten on my sin.",
