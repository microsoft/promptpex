  "input": "user: Draft an ode to an ancient oak tree.  \nassistant: - O mighty oak, with branches stretching wide,  \nThou hast stood centuries in thy quiet pride.  \nThy leaves doth whisper tales of yore,  \nAs generations pass beneath thy lore.",
  "output": "And yet I fain would sing thee a more deep-dew'd lay;  \nA song that dost evoke thy venerable age,  \nWherein the forest's murmurs merge with ancient sway,  \nAnd whispers loud with secrets of time's ever-flame.\nThou, like an elder to thy fellow trees dost stand,  \nEnthroned where shadows interlace and whisper soft,  \nWith veins in thine immense form doth chronicle all land.  \nEach scar a history that records the winds' rude oath.\nHere oft did woodland lovers meet to woo their mate,  \nWithin thy boughs they sought the haven of sweet entreaty,  \nWhere peace abideth ever with a youthful state.  \nFor thee each evening's light begins and ends its gait.\nAnd wist thou not dost thou the seasons change wither or grow?  \nThou art both gardener of earth and lord of storm and blight;  \nIn summer's heat wilt thou thy shade extend,  \nUpon all who come beneath thy verdant light. \nAt autumn's breath where once the leaves were clad in green,  \nAre they not sent as offering to those in need,  \nOr wilt thou yet embrace the frozen boughs of winter?  \nWilt thou doth remain immutable until each snow is heeded?\nIn all we see throughout our mortal sojourn,  \nThou art a constant witness both of joy and pain,\nA guiding, nurturing, living symbol of enduring calm.  \nThus hallowed with such wonderment, thy presence doth constrain.\nSo I implore thee, ever-standing in the woods,  \nTo guard not merely this ephemeral time alone,  \nBut also those who through thy shade their solace foundâ€”  \nMay thou remain as balm for many a lonely thought,\nAs lighthouse on some weary traveller's way.",
