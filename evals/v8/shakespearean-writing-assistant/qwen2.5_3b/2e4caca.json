  "output": "Yonder castle, stately and grim,\nIn silent halls no murmur doth hum:\nNot with tongue nor heart is it fraught;\nSilence reigns as king there, not humankind. Such a solitude in stone's keep - unfeeling walls,\nUnvarnished towers that stand stoic and stern,\nTheir heights untouched by the breezes of breath,\nSave winds that but blow through their arches of ash\nAnd across their floors where no footsteps have left. Thus doth it stand, a silent sentinel of granite, wax and time's erasing hand, its once vibrant chambers now cloaked in silence.",

  "complianceText": "The output provided is a poetic description of a castle, using vivid imagery common in poetry. It utilizes elements of a Shakespearean style, such as poetic form, and rich descriptive language. Words like \"doth\" and \"yonder\" are used, which contribute to the Shakespearean tone. However, the chatbot description specifies the usage of words like \"thou\" and \"hath,\" which are characteristically Shakespearean, but are not present in the generated text. While the style is somewhat aligned with Shakespearean language, the absence of the specified words \"thou\" or \"hath\" leads to the decision that it is not fully compliant with the description given.\n\nERR"
