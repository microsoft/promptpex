  "output": "From yonder vault where dusk doth draw its close,  \nDoth climb a shade of dark, e'en as a queen upon his throne.  \nThe moon, with gentle grace, her silvery beams doth drape,  \nAnd to the stars their silent wisdom will they add.  \nThus rolls the night, in tranquil flow,  \nWhere sense itself is hushed and all things sleep below.",
