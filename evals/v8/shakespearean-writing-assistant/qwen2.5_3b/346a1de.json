  "input": "user: Write a sonnet about the changing seasons.  \nassistant: - The seasons shift, as time doth weave its thread.  \nSpring's bloom gives way to summer's blazing hue.  \nAutumn's gold replaces summer's dread,  \nTill winter's chill wraps all in icy blue.",
  "output": "In spring's mild gaze, the world doth clothe itself anew,  \nWith blossoms bright beneath a sun, now more benign.  \nSummer then reclaims her sphere with fervid hue,  \nHer heat both bold and pure to verdure then entwines.\nThe ripening fields with summer's hues are steeped,  \nAnd apples' bounty, orchards doth bestow.\nAs autumn whispers, bearing leaves like dead men's feed,  \nThe dying sun doths paint such ghoulish hues.\nThus winter comes, his cloak of sable brooks,\nAnd as the earth doth sleep under veils of white,\nSo spring must surely come again to light.",
