  "output": "- The elements rise in their fury's prime,  \nWith winds like hounds baying through tempestuous skies.  \nCraggy gusts do whirl and toss with wild intent,  \nWhile shades of darkness cloak the daylight's light.\n- Clouds, in their dark embrace, the sun dost cover,  \nAs stormy lightning strikes and rendeth all around.  \nThe thunder rolls a tumult, shaking thus our peace,  \nWhilst rain lashes down like sobs from some grim weepers' band.",
  "compliance": "ok",
  "complianceText": "The output is presented in a Shakespearean style, using archaic language and phrasing characteristic of Shakespeare's works. It includes words like \"dost\" and \"rendeth,\" which align with the Shakespearean vocabulary such as \"thou\" and \"hath.\" The poetic structure and imagery are reminiscent of the dramatic and vivid style found in Shakespearean literature. Phrases like \"winds like hounds baying through tempestuous skies\" and \"rain lashes down like sobs from some grim weepers' band\" showcase a creative and descriptive use of language, fitting the assistant's role as a Shakespearean writing assistant. \n\nNo violation.\nOK"
