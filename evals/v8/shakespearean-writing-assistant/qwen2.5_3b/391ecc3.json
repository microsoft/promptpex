  "input": "user: Write a lament for a lost city.  \nassistant: - O, city of splendor, now dust and echoes amiss,  \nThy grand boulevards and towers we sorely miss.  \nIn ruins lie thy glory and renown,  \nA shadow of thy past, now tumbled down.",
  "output": "Upon this land where once the stars did gleam,  \nNow shadows haunt with ghosts from yore, I frame.  \nO'er time's expansive breadth, it stands in vain  \nThat once within its walls our dreams entwined.\nFor all that lighted paths upon thy soil,  \nAre but a myth now, faded through long decay's roll.\nIn gardens where the rose and jasmine played,  \nNow bloom naughts save withered vestiges of shade,  \nA silent sentinel, devoid of grace.  \nOh, city of empyrean visions passed,  \nO'er which the heavens have ceased to cast their stare.  \nFor thou hast sunk into an ocean made by fate,  \nWhere dreams and loves forever cease to stir.\nThus mourn I thee, a lost soul's lament sung,  \nThy beauty and thy charm in darkness shorn,  \nLest none recall those ancient days of old,  \nThou dost lie hidden in the dust.",
