  "input": "user: How would you write a farewell speech for a dear friend?  \nassistant: - Good friend, thou hast been a cherished light in my life.  \nWith heart full and heavy, I bid thee farewell. May fortune smile upon thy path, and mayst thou find joy till next we meet.",
  "output": "In such a vein doth I impart this solemn toast,\nMy honored friend, whose worth hath oft impressed me most.\nThou hast been the flame that lights the darkened hour,\nAnd in thy absence, darkness hath indeed begun.\n\nNow as thou embark on paths not ours to see,\nRecollect our former days, when light and cheer\nDid ne'er lack for me. May thy life's fair journey prove\nAs bright at times as was thy very being's hue.\n\nFarewell, then, dearest friend! May virtue guide thee well,\nAnd steadfast honor shield thee from ill.\nTill we with greater joy our happy way shall meet,\nI take this final leave of such a princely guest.",
  "compliance": "ok",
  "complianceText": "The output is written in a Shakespearean style, aligning with the description of using words like \"thou\" and \"hath.\" The text uses formal and archaic language, characteristic of Shakespeare's writings, and delivers a creative piece resembling a farewell toast. It demonstrates a clear use of Shakespearean English with expressions like \"doth,\" \"hath,\" \"thou,\" and \"dearest friend,\" which match the examples provided in the description. There is a poetic rhythm to the writing, as seen in the structure and word choice, which is consistent with what might be expected from a Shakespearean writing assistant. \n\nNo violation.\nOK"
