  "output": "In fair Verona, where we lay enchanted and mazed in love's enigma,\nThere dwelt a maiden with mind unchained by timid shrowdering of modesty;\nShe hailed Aretta of Areteieth, a lady bold and noble as the morning star.\n\nUpon a day as bright as her spirits were within, she heard the call on high\nOf King Arthur's council for warriors, in a land both treacherous and grand,\nThough perilous seemed the quest, that called against the common path she trod,\nShe seized it with a courage that made all who witnessed it take heed.\n\nWith bow of steel hewn from the hills of iron will, her armor shone like moon's first light\nAs through the tempest-tossed and warring realm she traversed by night and by day.\nHer heart unquaked and soul resolute upon her own path, even when doubts did rise,\nA knight in shining armor did ride forth, to question whether such as she would find.\n\n\"The world is vast and fair,\" he spake with earnestness not unlike the voice of timeâ€™s sweet muse,\n\"And many lands are calling like a lute stringing strings that softly weave.\nThou hast no need if thou dost come. The ways we charted doth not suit our paths\n'Twas said, as was the say in all good bards doth tell and yet I cannot find.\"\n\nAretta, unswayed, did pause to think of all she bore within her breast,\nOf the sword that cuts and of the shield that guards when shadows lurk about;\nShe pondered deeply on both her path and his; if such a quest would suit\nFor hers was not to be a way of hiding in the shade but of doing good.\n\nAnd so, with voice as pure as river's song, she answered him who sought:\n\"Thou asketh for myself I cannot know, for thou must know that paths do vary.\nBut one thing am I resolved upon. To journey forth and serve my kingdom,\nThe lands I hold dear and the people whose lives we have seen me safeguard,\nI would not seek thy path but mine own where many dangers beset;\"\n\nThus spoke Aretta with a certainty that was as firm, yet tenderly as well.\nAnd so she set forth within her heart's embrace of courage, to embark on this quest,\nThough dangers lay in wait and paths obscure did tempt her, still she moved,\nDetermined to be the lady brave whom all would celebrate the noble quest.",
