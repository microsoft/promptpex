  "output": "Blind is the sight that seeth not treacherous guile's plot,\nNor doth discern it with the sense divine;\nFor oft within the bosom of the noblest\nBetrayal lies like winter hidden in the sign of spring's mild ray.\nThus, when a friend his heart does with him knit,\nTo hear his faith with falsehood did he dote,\nHow mighteth hurt arise from gentle nature,  \nWhen inward hate doth in his tender breast beget,\nAnd makes his tongue as crooked as the venom'd serpent's!\nBetrayal, like a viper's poison'd fang, not oft doth it appear;\nIt stealthily insinueth himself into his friend's heart, \nBut at last does him such fatal harm.\nSo let us guard within our own pure hearts\nThe fire of faith and shield ourselves of sin,\nThat when betrayal seeketh entrance in,\nOur bosom with its walls against it quenching.\nSuch is life's oft-seen treachery, to be aware.",
