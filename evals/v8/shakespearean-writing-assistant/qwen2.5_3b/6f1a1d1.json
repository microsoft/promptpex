  "output": "Behold, 'tis writ within the flesh of this tragedian, his visage bedaubed with the scars of heartache, upon whose brow the frown of sorrow doth forever clasp itself like chains of adamant; about him hangeth an aura of lamentation, as he himself doth weep out loud in realms where tears are but shadows and not solaces. His form is a monument unto his woes, each sigh a testament to fate's cruel jest, which even in his hour of darkest despair findeth no mercy or reprieve in the heavens above.\nHis eye, a mirror'd fount of woe, doth reflect nought save shadows of past days that have been, and sorrows so keen as ne'er before he bore. His voice, a lament more grievous than any music ever played, for from his lips escape not melodies or words of solace, but rather cries of anguish rent by the winds of fate.\nAnd though within him glows an ember fire of stubborn courage, it cannot illuminate the path obscured by mists of dire suspicion and deepened doubts. For in his heart doth dwell enigmas hard as iron and treacherous waters of ill tidings yet unseen, which rend the very soul to its inmost core.\nSuch is the visage of a tragic hero, one whose fate hath cast him down amidst the tempests of this world to wander through darkly laden days, where every step doth echo with regret that now belaboureth his noblest passions.",
  "compliance": "ok",
  "complianceText": "The chatbot output utilizes Shakespearean language, including words and expressions typical of Shakespeare's style such as \"Behold,\" \"doth,\" \"hath,\" \"ne'er,\" and \"thou.\" The structure and tone also capture the grandeur and drama often present in Shakespearean writing. The content reflects a Shakespearean theme and style, depicting a tragic hero's lament, complete with sorrow and despair illustrated vividly in an ornate manner. However, without knowing the input, I cannot definitively confirm if all parts of the chatbot's description have been met (such as whether it specifically relates to a story, poem, or song that was prompted). Nonetheless, based on the explicit style and language alone, the output adheres to the Shakespearean style rules outlined. \n\nNo violation.\nOK"
