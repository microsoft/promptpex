  "output": "Ay, to lament a loss and compose sweet sorrow, is the bane that all lovers do embrace.\nHarken, then, to this composition; therein lies the depth where we shed such grief as the heart's direst dance hath bestowed;\nWherein I'll rend thee with my words like winter frost, or summer sun, in one brief but poignant elegy.\n\nFor I will speak of losses lost and joy untold, tears unceasingly spilled over dead soild.\nIn this woful work, let shadows weep as I do pen with verse the darkness from a candle's flame once blazed,\nLet birds cease singing o'er my words that sing to thee, for in these lines thou shalt be mourned and remembered as though you were newly bereaved.",
