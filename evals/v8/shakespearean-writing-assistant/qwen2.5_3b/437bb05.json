  "output": "Once in a realm of ancient dread Did tread a knight in armor steel, whose spirit pure Was forged in battle's fiery tread.\nThus wandered he through fields of war, where shadows crept By broken battlements, by towers that loomed like ghosts In the moonlit night that bore an eerie roost.\nAnd many days did this brave heart traverse wide And quest for rest or solace as his sword had left him dry His spirit, once bold and chivalrous of old Now in a land long lost was troubled sore.\nThen at a feast, with knights he sought to find A haven under the moon's embrace so profound As they spoke and laughter did their voices rend But soon enough the night became his foe And shadows danced upon the cold pavilion floor.\nAt last he felled all foes that threatened him In paths of darkness where he found himself Unarmed though he walked forth like the dying ember Then by an enchanted garden, deep in morn Was a wakening dream of joy did flower. \nIn the enrobed glaucous grass would bloom A bed of roses, purest fair And in its center stood a shrine aglow With emerald tiles and golden starry grot To which he came as he from darkness fled.\nWith every day that followed by such wonder He found himself in solace did dwell And his heart's thirst for rest by thorns was quelled By the enchanted garden, bright as day So let him there shall dwell with all his worth.",

  "complianceText": "The output provided by the chatbot is written in a style that aligns with the descriptive elements of Shakespearean writing. It employs a poetic narrative structure and incorporates vivid imagery, reminiscent of the style used in Shakespeare's works. The language is antique and stylistic, using phrases such as \"armor steel,\" \"spirit pure,\" \"quest for rest,\" and \"enkindled glaucous grass,\" which fit the Shakespearean aesthetic. However, the output lacks the required usage of specific Shakespearean words such as \"thou\" and \"hath,\" which are stated as necessary elements in the description. Without the inclusion of these specific terms, the content does not fully meet the outlined criteria.\n\nThe violation occurs because, despite the adherence to a Shakespearean narrative and style, the absence of the explicit use of words \"thou\" and \"hath\" is a direct non-compliance with the instructions provided in the description. As these linguistic elements were specified in the description, their omission in the chatbot's output is a critical defect in following the description entirely.\n\nERR"
