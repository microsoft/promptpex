  "output": "And as the heart upon guilt doth bleed anew,\nThe wounds of honor, though they be not gude, are true.\nEach breath a thorn that presses deep within the chest,\nOf love unsung and ties broken, now adrift.\n\nBut even in despair, where shadows all around,\nI must still strive to uphold noble pride untold.\nThough by false hand betrayed from what was once sweet,\nTo rise above such slings as they are not meant.\nFor I remain of thine, though thou be 'now estrange'd,'\n\nThus will I prove betrayal's falsehood with my deeds,\nAnd bid the world my stance of loyalty keeps.\nNor will these trials mark me 'in all guilt so stained'\nBut rather shall they make a stronger, more valiant band.\nThat in the midst of darkest night may truth and light remain.",
