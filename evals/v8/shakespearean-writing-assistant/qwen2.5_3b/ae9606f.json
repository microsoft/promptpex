  "output": "Moreover, we might write the epitaph with allusion and metaphor, reflecting upon the unsung hero's nature through more direct and vivid imagery:\n- Here doth one slumber whom the world hath not known so wide,  \nNor bared nor named his name amidst the crowd, yet heaven did it bestow.  \nHis spirit soared like eagles in the air above,  \nAnd with each act of kindness shone like stars at night.\nTherefore here let him forever dwell and be celebrated thus,\nThat oftentimes nobility lies beneath the humblest guise.",
