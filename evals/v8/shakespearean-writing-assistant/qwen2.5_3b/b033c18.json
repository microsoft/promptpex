  "output": "And thus beholdeth the morn that does declare Her dewy splendor on fields and meads agleamed; In verdant lawns where shepherds once did gently tread With pastoral lilies adorning their verdant head.\nHere spake forth a maiden, her cheek with rosy hue adorned, And youthful shepherd beside, his heart doth softly wound. They meet beneath the brightening boughs o'er fragrant flowers reeled, In sweet embrasures where the new-born sun was set - A tender moment that doth hint of ancient love, Of loves both bold and fair, within the blushin' dawning's glimmer.",
