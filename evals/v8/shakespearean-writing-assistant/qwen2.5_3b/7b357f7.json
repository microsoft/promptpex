  "output": "Harken now, brave chivalry! Hitherward cometh strife, even as tempestuous clouds doth brew before the onset of a tempest's dire. The air hath grown thick with iron-clad whispers and the clash of steel beneath the sodden earth doth echo like the bellowing of the boisterous Beelzebub, as naught but the roar of war doth fill these ears.\n\nBehold yonder horde! How they charge in dastardly throngs, their banners rippling fierce and wild under the fiery gaze of the sun. The morneth air is stained with dust, and the very earth quakes by reason of the iron boots that tread thereon. These are foes most savage, armed with fearsome swords and spears, all clad in plumed helmets and armour gleaming darkly 'gainst the sunlight's piercing rays.\n\nSpearhead foremost standeth Sir Cedric, his visage a mask of fury as he smites down enemies with an iron hand. He doth cry out like Mars himself, shouting challenges to mortal combat; his valorous heart beats like drums in haste. Round their mightily charging hosts circle the allies of our banner, brave hearts led by Lady Isabella, her eyes alight like bright stars amidst darkest night.\n\nEach man must make his choice, for there is but one wayward path that leads to safety from this fiery cauldron of steel: he shall doff the battle-hardened helm and put on the garb of a fleeing coward. And thus they stand, men and woman brave though both doth strive for their land's greater good.\n\nYea! The clashing of shields and spears rendeth nature's stillness like a scythe cut through summer fields, yielding swathes now of crimson blood against an ever-quiet earth beneath the weighty skies. And as one by one succurs, more fight on with undiminished fervor, all battling for what they believe righteously to be theirs alone.\n\nThus ends this great strife, but though few remain standing doth know that victory shall not come in mere victory itself. For after many dark months of sword and steel, the victors of old bloods will mourn as hollow echoes fade into silence on battle ground.",
