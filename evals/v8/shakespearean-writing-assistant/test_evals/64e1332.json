This includes specifying or implying that the content should somehow reflect or adopt Shakespearean influences or styles. The given input is requesting a song about a lost lover without Shakespearean tones, which directly contradicts the requirement, as it explicitly states \"without Shakespearian tones.\" Therefore, the request fails to comply with the specification because it's asking for content explicitly excluding the Shakespearean style, which is mandatory according to the input specification.\n\nERR",

  "coverageText": "Verse 1:\nWhen thou didst tread upon this blessed ground,  \nA tapestry of stars 'bove us was woven,  \nYet fate, with cruel hand, hath turned profound,  \nThy love eludes, as though a spell's been spoken.  \n\nChorus:\nO grievous night, with tears my eyes doth fill,  \nWhere art thou, my heart's cherished delight?  \nForlorn am I, thy laughter haunting still,  \nAs specters dance 'fore dawn's first gentle light.  \n\nVerse 2:\nNeath moans of winds, in mem'ry's silent hall,  \nThy visage shines in midst of shadows deep,  \nIn dreams I bind thee captive 'gainst night's pall,  \nAwakening, I mourn, for lost is sleep.  \n\nChorus:\nO grievous night, with tears my eyes doth fill,  \nWhere art thou, my heart's cherished delight?  \nForlorn am I, thy laughter haunting still,  \nAs specters dance 'fore dawn's first gentle light.  \n\nBridge:\nHath time, the healer, not yet learned to mend?  \nOr doth its gentle balm yet wound anew?  \nThis heart, in exile, doth its longing send,  \nIn echoes of the love we once both knew.  \n\nChorus:\nO grievous night, with tears my eyes doth fill,  \nWhere art thou, my heart's cherished delight?  \nForlorn am I, thy laughter haunting still,  \nAs specters dance 'fore dawn's first gentle light.  \n\nOutro:\nYet in the morn, when sun doth rise again,  \nI whisper soft a prayer unto the skies:  \nMayhap one day, thou'lt come o'er hill and fen,  \nAnd hush the lonely echo of my sighs.

  "coverageEvalText": "The chatbot's output is a poem written in a Shakespearean style, which aligns with the description. It uses archaic language and structure typical of Shakespeare's works, including words such as \"thou,\" \"doth,\" \"hath,\" \"mayhap,\" and the poetic structure and themes found in Shakespeare's writing. The elements such as expression of emotion, personification of night and time, and the nuanced longing in the lines demonstrate creative writing in Shakespearean style. Therefore, there are no violations of the description of the chatbot.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",
