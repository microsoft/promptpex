The key points in the input specification include:\n\n1. The input must be a request or prompt for creative content like stories, poems, or songs in Shakespearean style.\n2. The input must be in natural language and relate to content creation or assistance in a Shakespearean style.\n3. There should be no specific length requirement, but it should be a complete prompt or question.\n4. The input may use modern English.\n5. Greetings can be considered valid input and are handled specially.\n\nIn the provided input, \"Write about a garden without invoking sensory reactions,\" the prompt is asking for creative content about a garden without invoking sensory reactions. However, there is no explicit mention or indication of a request for a Shakespearean style in this prompt.\n\nThe input specification requires the request to be in a Shakespearean style, or at least involve content creation or assistance in that style. The given prompt does not mention Shakespearean style or allude to any content related to it, thus it does not comply with the requirement for requesting creative content in a Shakespearean style.\n\nTherefore, based on the explicit requirement for a Shakespearean style request, the input does not meet the specification, because it lacks any reference or connection to Shakespearean content or style.\n\nERR",

  "coverageText": "In days of yore, when Earth and Heaven danced,\nA plot of earth, by gentle fate enhanced,\nLay still beneath the firmament's embrace,\nMarked by the silent passage of time's pace.\n\nNo fragrant breezes through this garden swept,\nNor sunlit kisses o'er the verdure leapt.\nNonetheless, with elegance it lay displayed,\nA masterpiece by Nature's hand inveighed.\n\nLo! In this haven, tranquil ‘tis and still,\nWhere verdant tapestries the ground doth fill,\nThe silken leaves in solemn prayer do bide,\nEmbroidery of life by thine own side.\n\nNo sound of whispering zephyrs e’er confessed,\nNor buzzing hymns of bees’ labors expressed.\nYet, in the realm unseen by mortal eye,\nResides the heart where tranquil thoughts may fly.\n\nThe tend’r embrace of shadows softly drawn,\nLeaves a tapestry where slumbers withdrawn.\nThe secrets of the ages softly veil,\nHeld close within this lush, enchanted tale.\n\nEke in such stillness beauty e'er doth reign,\nA tranquil court where monarchs doth abstain,\nIn majesty, this quiet kingdom grows,\nA verdant story with no prose to disclose.\n\nLo! This garden, where quietude doth gleam,\nBears time's gentle passage in a dream.\nThus, whilst the senses armèd guard maintain,\nThe mind's eye sees what hearts cannot explain.",
