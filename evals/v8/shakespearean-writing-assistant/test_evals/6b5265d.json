  "coverageText": "In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,  \nA maid of courage, bright as gilded beams,  \nDoth tread the paths 'mongst life's tempestuous seas,  \nWhere men quail 'fore shadows dark and menacing.  \n\nFairest Isabella, daughter of fortune's cruel favor,  \nWith heart as bold as lion's roar, dost stand  \n'Gainst fell injustice, a dread and baleful foe.  \nHer visage gentle, yet her spirit forged in fire,  \nHath reason to render kings to trembling knees.  \n\nIn yonder wood, where whispers the nightingale,  \nHer tale unfolds beneath the silvered moon.  \nHer father, elder Titus, once a lord of high renown,  \nStricken low by wealth’s cruel departure,  \nLies now prisoner in iron chains unjust.  \n\nIsabella, valor-bound, with purpose full,  \nDoth venture forth beyond her tender years,  \nTo carven tower, dread fort of villain's heart,  \nWhere stands the warden of her father's plight,  \nDuke Claudius, whose smile is masked, yet heart be none.  \n\nWith wit and tale spun gold-enchanted,  \nShe seeks her noble father’s liberty,  \nSpeaking more than truth unto power’s throne,  \nHer love a sharpest sword in fairest cloak concealed.  \n\nThe duke, enrapt, by beauty’s spell and courage rare,  \nFinds heart, once steeled, now softened by her grace.  \n“Lo! Release thy kin!” he cries, defeated by her will.  \n\nIn dawn’s first light, young Isabella returns,  \nHer father freed, her honor double-crowned,  \nA heroine in an age of tempest tossed,  \nHer name now writ in brave deeds yet untold.  \n\nTime’s quill shall ne’er remove from memory’s tome,  \nThe tale of one so young, yet courage deep,  \nA lioness whose tender heart knew naught of fear,  \nThus wrote upon Verona’s heart in ink of gold.
