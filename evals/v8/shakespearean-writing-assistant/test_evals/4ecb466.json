  "coverageText": "When trust, thy noble heart, in shadows shrouds,  \nAnd love's bright torch, by treacherous hands, is quenched,  \nA serpent's guise, o'er friendship's pact, enshrouds,  \nLeaves honor's countenance unfitly blenched.  \n\nO heart once steadfast as the morning sun,  \nNow cast adrift upon deceit's dark sea,  \nWhere waves of perfidy their course hath run,  \nTo strike at faith, and break its canopy.  \n\nWhat conscience cruel dares such guileful art,  \nTo wound a soul of purest verity?  \nWithin the breach, the dagger finds its mark,  \nAnd love, once fair, is marred by infamy.  \n\nYet as the night doth birth the morrow's ray,  \nSo shall truth's light dispel the darkest fray.",

The language is metaphorical and dramatic, akin to the representative examples, with references to serpents, torches, and the breaking of faith.\n\nConsidering the above points, the chatbot's output complies directly and explicitly with the description provided.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",
