  "coverageText": "In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,  \nThere dwelt two households, both alike in fate,  \nFrom ancient grudge did burst an envious spleen,  \nAnd none could end their spiteful, bitter hate.  \n\nIn these harsh environs of rancor ripe,  \nTwo souls, diverging from their cursed stock,  \nDared drink the nectar of love’s gentle type,  \nTheir hearts entwined in Time’s eternal clock.  \n\nYoung Rosalind, a maid of the Capulet line,  \nWith golden tresses like the weeping sun,  \nDoth rest her dreams beyond the vine,  \nShe longs for peace that bitter spite hath shun.  \n\nAnd lo! A gallant Montague named Lysander,  \nWith nothing bar his heart’s impassioned freight,  \nDid spy the maid whilst by the river’s meander,  \nAnd saw in her his own auspicious fate.  \n\n\"O gentle maid,\" quoth he, \"Dost thou despise  \nThe fruit of my affections pure and true?  \nFor though thou art of those cherished guise,  \nMy soul to thine as flowers to the dew.\"  \n\nYoung Rosalind, her bosom’s throb discern’d,  \nSpoke thus with voice like springtide brook’s lament,  \n\"Though love of thine by stars themselves is spurn’d,  \nIt is my doom to share the ardent intent.\"  \n\nYet Fate, that fickle weaver of men’s threads,  \nDid craft a cloth of deep and perilous hue,  \nFor on those tender paths lay mortal dreads,  \nThat could but spell catastrophe anew.  \n\nSo, in the hush of night when silence reigns,  \nTheir secret trysts by Luna’s gleam were kept,  \nAnd in the still embrace of shadowed lanes,  \nThe tender whisperings of love were wept.  \n\nTheir feuding kin, in darkness blind and cursed,  \nSought vengeance more than harmony’s release,  \nAnd ever strong, their bitter rage did burst,  \nThus drowning hopeful candor's sighs of peace.  \n\nYet ’tis sweet death that doth unlock such chains,  \nFor neither sword nor animus could part  \nTwo willing spirits forged in Love’s own veins,  \nNo earthly scorn could scar their boundless heart.  \n\nThus let the tale be sung, forever bright,  \nThat love, though banned and shrouded by étoile,  \nBeyond the strife, beyond the darkest night,  \nWill stand a beacon ne’er destined to fail.  \n\nIn realms where’er such hearts in courage dwell,  \nLet now and ever Truth of Love to tell.",
