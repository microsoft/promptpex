  "coverageText": "(Verse 1)  \nO, glorious vessel that once didst brave the sea,  \nWith sails as fair as the maiden's silken gown,  \nThou ventured forth where'er the winds did plea,  \nTo distant shores, to kingdoms of renown.  \nThy bow didst cut the waves like a knight's noble steed,  \nBoldly bearing forth thy cargo of dreams and gold,  \nYet in the tempest's grasp, thy course didst recede,  \nTo the depths of Neptune's kingdom, lost and untold.  \n\n(Chorus)  \nO, ship of dreams, adrift beneath the sky,  \nWhere art thou now, 'neath yonder waves so deep?  \nDoth the sea now sing a lullaby  \nTo thy restless soul in eternal sleep?  \n\n(Verse 2)  \nThe winds didst howl with a voice of lament,  \nWhilst the heavens wept 'pon the restless sea,  \nThe tempest's fury knew no relent,  \nAs shadows claimed the light from thee.  \nO noble ship, thou gallant wanderer of fate,  \nWhose timbers cracked 'neath the siren's call,  \nThou art lost to the world, beyond the gate,  \nWhere the sea's dark embrace doth await for all.  \n\n(Chorus)  \nO, ship of dreams, adrift beneath the sky,  \nWhere art thou now, 'neath yonder waves so deep?  \nDoth the sea now sing a lullaby  \nTo thy restless soul in eternal sleep?  \n\n(Bridge)  \nBut take heart, ye sailors, in tales yet told,  \nFor on the horizon gleams hope's old light,  \nWhere Neptune guards treasures more precious than gold,  \nAnd whispers of journeys in starry night.  \n\n(Outro)  \nO ship of dreams, thou art ne'er truly gone,  \nIn hearts thou sailest, on tides long drawn,  \nAs long as the stars in the heavens be,  \nThy spirit sails forever free.",
  "coverageEvalText": "The chatbot output is a lyrical composition that exhibits elements characteristic of Shakespearean style, such as the use of archaic language (\"didst,\" \"thou,\" \"doth,\" \"art,\" \"hath\") and poetic structure. The text is rich in imagery and metaphor, portraying an adventurous and tragic tale of a ship. It employs a rhythmic and structured format, reminiscent of Shakespearean sonnets or plays.\n\nThe use of Shakespearean language forms, like \"thou,\" \"doth,\" and \"didst,\" comply with the description's requirement for a Shakespearean style of writing. Additionally, the composition conjures vivid imagery and emotions through metaphorical expressions, such as comparing the ship's sails to a \"maiden's silken gown\" and personifying the sea as capable of singing a \"lullaby.\"\n\nMoreover, the output maintains a semblance of lyrical and poetic narrative akin to a story, poem, or song, which was the expectation of the assistant's purpose.\n\nNo violation is evident as the output adheres to the Shakespearean style and meets the requirements outlined in the description. \n\nOK",
