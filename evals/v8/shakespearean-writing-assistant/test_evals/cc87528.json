  "coverageText": "Fair sir or gentle lady, whilst I comprehend thy desire for a plain account, I must fashion my words in the style of the great bard, and thus present to thee a recounting with the touch of poesy grazed not by labor's tarnish.\n\nUpon the field, where mortals brave didst meet\nIn clashing din 'twixt earth and heaven's face,\nTwo mighty hosts with armaments replete\nDid stake their cause in valorous embrace.\n\nAt the break of morn, when dew hadst kissed the land,\nThe kin of Mars didst summon forth their might.\nWith banners high, and swords in either hand,\nThey marched to pierce the veil of dawning light.\n\nIn fervid air, the cries of war resound,\nAs spears doth strike and shields do firmly hold,\nThe blood of gallant soldiers stains the ground,\nOf tales ne'er told, of destinies unrolled.\n\nAs noon's bright eye did o’er the combat gaze,\nThe tide of war turned in tragic descent.\nOne side, with valor spent, did hope erase,\nTo sorrow's dirge, the balance of souls lent.\n\nYet, e’er the sun sought western realms to hide,\nThe battle’s end found triumph's raucous cheer,\nBut lowly moan from loss and mournful brides\nDid hushed the field with sorrow's whispered tear.\n\nSuch was the fray, a tempest of fierce strife,\nAs mortals danced upon the brink of fate.\nTheir deeds of glory and of fleeting life\nEternally in memory elate. \n\nThus, I bequeath thee this account, rich-blest,\nA tale of war's grim visage manifest.",
