  "coverageText": "O, list unto my woeful tune, fair friend,  \nFor sorrow's breath doth haunt me night and day.  \nUpon a dark and loveless path I wend,  \nAnd ne'er a beam of sunshine guides my way.  \n\nIn shadows deep, my heart laments its grief,  \nWith tears as dew upon the morn's soft bloom.  \nThe world, it seemeth, giveth no relief,  \nAnd all my days are cloaked in endless gloom.  \n\nWhy dost thou flee from me, sweet joy's embrace?  \nHath cruel fate with bitter hand decreed  \nThat nevermore shall I thy visage trace,  \nNor find the balm to cure my soul's great need?  \n\nAlas, the heavens gaze coldly from above,  \nAnd silence wraps mine ears in its repose.  \nIn solitude I pine, bereft of love,  \nWhilst passion, like a rose, doth fade and close.  \n\nO moonlit night, cast forth thy gentle gleam,  \nAnd guide my weary soul through tempest vast.  \nPerchance in sleep's embrace, I yet may dream,  \nOf times when joy and I were wed steadfast.  \n\nThus sing I now, with heart o'erflowed with sighs,  \nTill morn shall break and colors fill the skies.",

It uses archaic words and phrases such as \"O,\" \"thee,\" \"doth,\" \"ne'er,\" \"seemeth,\" \"dost thou,\" and \"hath,\" which are characteristic of Shakespeare's language. The structure and themes present in the text, like love, laments, and nature, are also typical of the style. Overall, the language and poetic form employed successfully reflect the Shakespearean style as requested.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",
