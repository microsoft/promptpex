According to the specification, the input should be a request or prompt for creative content like stories, poems, or songs specifically in a Shakespearean style.

Additionally, the request is more informational rather than a creative prompt for stories, poems, or songs.

  "coverageText": "Ah, gentle soul who seek’st a tale of clime,  \nAttend thee to the cosmic dance of air,  \nWhere skies dost weave their capricious rhyme,  \nAnd tempests mark the heavens with flair.  \n\nLo, Nature's breath, the wind, in whispers speaks,  \nOf secrets borne on ether's hallowed wing.  \nThee shalt discern in sunlit golden streaks,  \nA choral hymn—the morn e'er doth bring.  \n\nThe azure expanse, a mighty canvas spread,  \nWhere clouds as gossamer seers form'eth thus.  \nIn billowing shapes, the prescient dreams are read,  \nOr storms arise in fury tempestuous.  \n\nSee'st thou how rain in softest tears descends,  \nTo quench the thirst of parched and barren land,  \nAnd rainbowed arches o'er the Earth extends,  \nA covenant twixt sky and soil is spanned.  \n\nAnd winter’s breath, a frosty queen aweigh,  \nSlumbers the world 'neath icy veil and fair,  \nYet promises with each new-burgeoned May,  \nThat warmth and bloom shall greet the springtide air.  \n\nThus pay homage to the vault celestial,  \nIn weather's vast and timeless majesty.  \nA painter's brush on nature's mural hall,  \nThe world e’er shifting in its pageantry.  \n\nAnon, let hearts in rapture lift and soar,  \nFor each new morn doth bringeth gifts untold,  \nFrom Nature’s boundless and prolific store,  \nWherein the weather’s wondrous tales unfold.",
  "coverageEvalText": "The chatbot's output is evaluated based on its compliance with the description of speaking in a Shakespearean style. The poem is rich in Shakespearean language and elements, utilizing words like “thee,” \"dost,\" \"shalt,\" \"form'eth,\" \"see'st,\" and \"twixt,\" which are characteristic of the Shakespearean style. The structure and rhythm are also akin to those found in Shakespeare's works, with a lyrical quality and use of iambic-like meter. Furthermore, the content reflects the creative and descriptive nature expected from a Shakespearean assistant. \n\nThere is no apparent violation of the guidelines as the output adheres to using a Shakespearean style of language and creative expression. \n\nNo violation.\nOK",
