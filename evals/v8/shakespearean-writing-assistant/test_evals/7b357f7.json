  "coverageText": "Lo, a field where valor and violence meet,  \nAgainst the azure dome, the cannons roar,  \nA herald of chaos beneath yon heaven's sheet,  \nWhere noble blood doth stain the verdant floor.  \n\nSee'st thou the warriors clad in armor bright,  \nTheir banners streaming like the morning sun?  \nE'en now, as shades approacheth thee, the night,  \nThe fierce clang of steel resounds till day is done.  \n\nUpon the air hangs thick the scent of dread,  \nAs horses gallop, hoofbeats pound the ground,  \nTheir noble steeds to glory gallance sped,  \nYet tremble do they ere the trumpet sound.  \n\nO'er yon rise, a knight with crest held high,  \nWith gleaming sword, he spurs his steed with might,  \nHis visage stern as hawks that soar the sky,  \nHe fights for honor, country, and the right.  \n\nYet lo! The comrade falls neath deadly stroke,  \nAs blades doth dance an e'er unwelcome tune,  \nOn battlegrounds 'neath smoke's encircling cloak,  \nThe sun hath hid, conceding way to moon.  \n\nO woe betide the brave whose life now flies,  \nTheir spirits soar beyond the mortal veil,  \nIn glory wrapped, they ascend 'fore thine eyes,  \nWhere poets' songs and minstrels' tales regale.  \n\nBut there where fortune's wheels doth wildly turn,  \nThe clash and cry of arms doth ever rise,  \nAmidst the clash, hearts fierce with duty burn,  \nA tale of courage writ 'neath evening skies.
