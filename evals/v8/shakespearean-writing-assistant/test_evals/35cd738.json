  "coverageText": "Dear heart, as thou requesteth an elegy writ  \nIn language of the bard, I shall oblige thee swift.  \n\nLo, with a heavy heart I pen these mournful lines,  \nIn mem'ry of the soul that in silence now reclines.  \nBeneath the silver'd moon, where shadows softly dance,  \nI weave this solemn verse, to bid sweet death's romance.\n\nO gentle spirit, thou hast taken flight,  \nOn wings of heav'nly grace into the night.  \nThough earth retains thy visage and thy voice,  \nThe stars dost bear the echo of thy choice.  \n\nThy laughter once, like streams in springtime's flow,  \nHath now been quelled, like autumn's waning glow.  \nYet in the hearts of those who knew thee well,  \nA timeless spark, thy mem'ry, e'er shall dwell.  \n\nThee art like to the rose that pale dost fade,  \nYet in its leaves, the sacred scent is laid.  \nThee leaveth us with token love to cherish,  \nThat love like steadfast flowers ne'er shall perish.  \n\nKind soul, upon this earth thou tread no more,  \nYet in our thoughts, thou art not forlorn.  \nMay angels tend thee gently to thy rest,  \nAnd in the fields celestial, find thee blest.  \n\nThus here I lay this wreath of words to thee,  \nWhose virtues shone with radiant purity.  \nThou art but clothed in dreams of endless grace,  \nTill, Lord, we meet again in love's embrace.  \n\nFarewell, dear soul, the night doth softly call,  \nBut in the light of dawn, weâ€™ll meet o'er all.",
