  "coverageText": "O, how doth my soul in shadows pine,  \nUpon the chasm 'twixt mine and thine,  \nWhere once bright hopes did dance and play,  \nNow doth silent echoes mourn the day.  \n\nFair visage thou possess'st, like morn's first light,  \nYet in mine eyes dost vanish from sight,  \nWith tender glances ne'er returned,  \nFor thy favor, my spirit hath yearned.  \n\nThine heart, like a fortress cold and high,  \nDoth keep my longing at bay, sigh by sigh.  \nO Fortune, fickle and most unkind,  \nWhy dost thou keep such joys confined?  \n\nThe gentle breeze doth whisper thy name,  \nAnd yet, alas, thy love I ne'er could claim.  \nIn dreams alone do I find sweet rest,  \nIn waking hours, a heart distressed.  \n\nHath not the flower its own sweet scent?  \nThough destined to bloom alone, content?  \nSo must I cherish from afar,  \nBeneath love's distant, shimmering star.  \n\nThus, with this verse, I lay my plea,  \nTo float with the stars eternally,  \nHoping one day thou might light upon,  \nThe love that's twixt the twilight drawn.
