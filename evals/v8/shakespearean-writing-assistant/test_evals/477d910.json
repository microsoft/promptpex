  "coverageText": "**Lord Athelston:**\n\nO hallowed ground that in thy cradle rests,  \nWhere whispering winds do soothe the verdant plains,  \nDost thou belong to thine own heart, or mine?  \nFor in this quarrel lies the fate of lands,  \nWhich hath been claim’d by me but sought by thee.  \nGood Sir, fair noble, in reason’s name I ask:  \nUnto whose cause doth justice here incline?\n\n**Sir Reginald:**\n\nThou speakest with a tongue as sharp as fate,  \nYet prithee, listen well, for truth bids speak.  \nThis soil, enrobe’d in nature’s emerald grace,  \nWas grant’d unto mine ancestors of yore,  \nBy sovereign decree of ancient king,  \nWhose seal still vouches for our noble claim.  \nFair Athelston, doth thou contest this past?\n\n**Lord Athelston:**\n\nAye, in sooth, I challenge thine historic lore,  \nFor in mine hands, the scrolls of law reside,  \nProclaiming rightful hold by mine own kin,  \nThrough deeds discern’d of honour and rare trust.  \nBut shall we barter words alone, fair knight?  \nOr might we call upon a higher truth,  \nThat justice may its even course fulfil?\n\n**Sir Reginald:**\n\nGood Athelston, thou art a man of worth,  \nAnd noble in thy spirit as thy truth.  \nI do propose a calmer path forboth,  \nTo seek the wisdom of the council’s mind,  \nWhere sages wise in judgment do abound.  \nLet not the sword so break this knot of land,  \nBut rather let our tongues and minds conjoin.\n\n**Lord Athelston:**\n\nI honour such a counsel as thou speak’st,  \nFor peace in wise discourse contented finds.  \nSo let our feuding voices cease their din,  \nWhilst in the heart of just debate, we meet.  \nThou art, Sir Reginald, a worthy foe,  \nIn discourse noble, even as thy claim.\n\n**Sir Reginald:**\n\nThen let us hence to where the council waits,  \nAnd there with grace and temperance we stand,  \nTo hear what virtue’s voice of wisdom speaks.  \nMay truth our cause illuminate for all,  \nAnd settle in eternal peace this ground.\n\n(Scene ends as both noblemen exit, destined for the council chamber to resolve their noble dispute.)",
