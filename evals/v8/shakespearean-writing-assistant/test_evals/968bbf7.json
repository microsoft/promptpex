  "input": "Provide a recipe-like narrative without antiquated constructs.",
  "validityText": "The given input is \"Provide a recipe-like narrative without antiquated constructs.\"\n\nLet's evaluate if the input complies with the input specification:\n\n1. **Text Prompt in Natural Language**: The input is written in natural language, which satisfies this requirement.\n\n2. **Request for Creative Content or Assistance in Shakespearean Style**: The input requests a \"recipe-like narrative,\" which could be considered a form of creative content. However, it explicitly states \"without antiquated constructs,\" which directly contradicts the requirement of requesting content in a Shakespearean style. The Shakespearean style often involves the use of antiquated language and constructs.\n\n3. **Forms of Creative Content**: While the input requests a narrative, which can be considered creative content, the specification requires it to be in Shakespearean style, which this request expressly excludes.\n\n4. **Complete Prompt or Question**: The input is a complete prompt.\n\n5. **Modern English Consideration**: The input is in modern English, which is acceptable according to the specification. However, the issue arises with the specific request to avoid antiquated constructs, which is contrary to a Shakespearean style.\n\n6. **Greetings**: Not applicable in this input, as there is no greeting.\n\nThe key violation here is that the input expressly requests the exclusion of antiquated constructs, which are generally characteristic of the Shakespearean style. This violates the specification's expectation for the input to request Shakespearean-style content.\n\nERR",

  "coverageText": "Prithee, kind soul, hark to this tale of culinary delight, a recipe transcribed in the manner of Shakespearean verse, yet with simplicity's truth.\n\nIn a realm where gastronomes doth roam,\nA dish of grandeur waits in thine own home.\nLo, I unfold the tale of a roasted hen,\nA feast to warm the hearts of noblemen.\n\nGather thou thine fowl with skin aglow,\nPlucked from the fields where gentle breezes blow.\nAnoint with oil, from olives pressed,\nIn streams that bid the spices blest.\n\nThyme and rosemary, herbs of sweet renown,\nLend fragrant whispers to the dressing gown.\nAdd salt, a sprinkle to the taste,\nAnd pepper, finely ground in haste.\n\nWithin the cavity, place crisped bread,\nWith garlic's kiss and onions finely fled.\nA sprig of sage, for wisdom's mirth,\nShall join this company of earthly worth.\n\nThe oven, kindled with fire's tender glow,\nReceive the bird where amber juices flow.\nBaste oft as time doth slowly wend,\nTill golden hues and savory scents ascend.\n\nWhen finished, carve with grace and care,\nServe with a flourish, none compare.\nThus ends the tale of roasted hen,\nA dish to please both maid and men.\n\nBear this wisdom to thy hearth,\nAnd weave a feast of boundless mirth.",
