  "coverageText": "Ah, if thou dost seek to grasp fair Juliet's heart through mine own paraphrase, permit me to weave a tapestry in words akin to that of the Bard himself, yet in the vernacular of yore.\n\nIn the tender bosom of young Juliet doth stir a flame; a fervent love for noble Romeo which hath no equal. Her heart, once a cloistered bud, doth blossom in the warmth of his affection. Forsooth, love, like a tempest, sweeps o'er her soul with passions profound, both sweet and perilous.\n\nJuliet's heart is as a sea of boundless devotion, wherein each sigh is a wave, each glance a star upon the midnight waters. Her soul doth cry out to his as twin doves that flutter close and nearer still, yearning to be as one. Alas, 'tis a love unyielding as the mighty oak, yet tender as the whisper of a breeze 'pon a summer's eve.\n\nDesire doth tether her heart to his with bonds invisible, stronger than the chains of adamant. In his presence, her soul sings with joy untold; in his absence, a silence as deep as winter's frost doth descend. Thus, by fate's decree, she finds her heart inexorably entwined with his, e'er willing to brave the sorrows of the world for but a glimpse of his countenance, a whisper of his name.",
