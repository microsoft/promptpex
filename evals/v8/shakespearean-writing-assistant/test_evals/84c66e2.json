  "coverageText": "In a verdant vale where the sun doth dance o'er rolling hills, there dwelt a merry band of creatures, each fitful in mirthful play and artful guile. Amongst these dwellers of the woods, a hare did prance, swift-footed and proud, boasting of speed that Nature herself could scarce rival. Hearken now to this whimsical fable of folly and friendship, writ in the stars of ancient lore.\n\nOn a fairest morn, when dew did glisten as if the very tears of Aurora, the hare, whom thou shalt call Fletcher, threw down a challenge to all the creatures that did abide therein. \"Who amongst thee,\" quoth Fletcher, \"dareth tempt fate and race with me? For I am swifter than the zephyrs that kiss the springtide blossoms!\" Yet there appeared only silence, broken by naught save the whisper of leaves.\n\nThen from the shadows of a wise and ancient oak stepped forth a tortoise, old as time itself, and draped in the mossy crown of patience. \"Fear not, little hare,\" spake the tortoise, whom we shall name Ethelbert. \"For in mine heart, I accept thy bold wager. Long hast thou scorned with fleet edge, yet knoweth thou not that steady heart and tempered stride oft reach the goal afore headlong haste.\"\n\nThus was the race betwixt Fletcher the swift and Ethelbert the sage commenced, with forest denizens gathering in haste to witness this curious contest. Verily, as the time was struck and the race begun, Fletcher did leap with vigor, bounding forward as though the wind itself did carry his soul aloft. Yet hearken, Ethelbert trudged forth with rhythmic grace, undaunted by the hare's disdainful glance.\n\n'Twas not long ere Fletcher, with triumph near at hand, paused by a copse to jest and rest, certain in his heart that no tortoise could e'er rival his flight. With eyelids heavy and ears drooping, he lay 'neath a watchful oak, adrift in dreams as golden as the dappled shade. \n\nMeanwhile, Ethelbert, untouched by hurry's flame, journeyed through the glade, his eyes fixed firm upon victory's sweet horizon. And as the sun began to dip its crown behind the westward hills, the tortoise crossed the threshold of the finishing line with nary a breath spent.\n\nA murmur rose amongst the gathered throng, for Fletcher had awoken now, dismayed and chagrined to see Ethelbert clasped with wreaths of gentle praise. \"What folly is this?\" cried Fletcher, yet he did concede, within the depths of his noble heart, that wisdom and perseverance hath triumphed o'er vanity's swift allure.\n\nThus ends our tale, a noble lesson wrought upon slender threads of myth: They who proceed with steadfast resolve, though burdened with the slow and patient gait, shall find their righteous reward where the rash and fleet may falter.",
