  "coverageText": "Upon the eve of noble festivity, within the grand and vaulted hall where royalty doth weave its storied tapestries, there gathered the august company of lords and ladies, bedecked in garments of silk and velvet rich. The chamber glowed with candles’ golden gleam, casting shadows that danced upon the tapestries wrought with ancient lore.\n\n‘Twas a banquet fit for kings—ne’er hath such opulence been witnessed ‘fore mine eyes. The tables, long as knights' enduring oaths, were laden with the fruits of earth's abundance. Platters of roasted fowl, their skins a crisped gold, did greet the famished gazes of those present, whilst pheasant, peacock, and venison lay in array, bedecked with herbs of garden’s fairest yield.\n\nUpon the dais sat the sovereign, a visage framed by crown and wisdom’s years, who lifted goblets with a regal grace, bestowing nectar of fermented grape upon eager tongues. Music, sweet as Zephyr's gentle breath, filled the air, and minstrels did weave melodies that stirred the soul like summer's bourgeoning bloom.\n\nFrom every quarter, voices raised in mirth, the room alive with tales of chivalry and jest. Methinks, in such moments, time itself doth pause, held in thrall by the joy and kinship of heart. The laughter of the court, a symphony of merriment, merged with clinking cups and clattering plates to create an orchestra of human joyance.\n\nAs night drew on, the moon, a silver diadem upon heaven's breast, shone o'er the revelry. The feast was but a stage, each player therein a part of this grand design, a tableau vivant where fleeting joy gives way to memory. Thus, if e'er thou should recount a scene of royal feast with mirth and pomp abound, let it be known that tale of grandeur here told is foul eclipsed by the truth therein beheld.",
