  "coverageText": "Behold, a vision pure and verdant, where thou dost tread upon soft earth kissed by Apollo's fair beams. As thou wander, gentle fragrance doth rise, borne upon Zephyr's caress, whispering secrets of Flora's realm. Rows of delicate blooms spread forth, their hues a symphony of nature's palette, whilst beneath their tender forms lie emerald carpets, weaving tapestries of spring.\n\nHast thou witnessed such riches? In yon corner standeth towering trees, their boughs a canopy of shelter, cloaking hidden courts for creatures that doth dwell. A babbling brook doth traverse amidst these shades, its dance and murmur the melody of nature's gentle grace.\n\nAmidst this fair expanse, thou shalt find repose, a sanctuary for both body and soul amid blushing roses and lily’s white purity. Seek thou solace beneath the azure sky, where the sun and moon make merry as they weave the eternal cycle of dawn and dusk. Such is the garden, a creation both humble and grand, where man's toils and nature's beauty do forever embrace.",
