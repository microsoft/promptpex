  "output": "Here's a draft speech about the pursuit of a dream:\n\n\"Hark, dear friends! Gather 'round and heed my words of old,\nAs I shall speak to thee of dreams that never grow cold.\n'Tis in the quest for something more to make thy heart delight,\nThat thou shalt find true fulfillment, shining like the morning's first light.\n\n\"A sturdy heart, with courage strong and virtue at its core,\nShall drive thee forward through life's tempests and darksome shore.\nFor though the road ahead may wind and twist with endless test,\nThou shalt not falter, nor thy dreams be lost in weary quest.\n\n\"Through trials and strife, where thou mayst stumble, thou shalt rise anew,\nWith strength refined, like tempered steel, to face each new pursue.\nAnd when the darkness gathers 'round, as winter's night draws near,\nThen shone shall forth thy heart, a beacon bright, dispelling all fear.\n\n\"For dreams are not vain joys, nor fleeting pleasures, or mere fancy's sway,\nBut living principles, etched on thy soul, to shape each passing day.\nSo hold fast to passion, and let imagination be thine guide,\nLest thou, like Orpheus, descend into the underworld of endless night.\n\n\"Make up thy mind to pursue thy dreams, with steadfast heart aflame,\nThrough winding paths, or steep ascents, or darksome valleys, it may seem to claim;\nFor when thou findest thy niche, like a flower blooming in the sun,\nThou shalt behold thy greatest triumph: an unvanquished spirit, forever young.\"\n\nHow's this?",
