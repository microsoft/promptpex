  "output": "Mortal friends, gather 'round and heed my tale,\nOf Royal Feasts, where courtly merriment did prevail,\nIn days of yore, when monarchs reign'd with regal might,\nAt least a night's repast in splendor was their delight.\n\n'Twas in the halls of Windsor, where the royal seat\nDid beat upon the breast, that all the nobles' cheer\nWas filled by revelry and jollity so free,\nAs if 'twere Christmastide, when merriment doth be.\n\nThe tables groaned with victuals of great renown,\nRoast swan, capon, game fowl, and fritters to crown:\nGardeinants' tales and tales of yore did flow like wine,\nWhile minstrels played the lute and pipes did sing in line.\nThe queen, a vision fair, with jewels shining bright,\nDid reign supreme, her presence radiating delight.\n\nBut soft! What light through yonder window breaks?\nA servant whispers low: \"Oh woe is me! 'Tis night,\nThe king's guest list grows thin; guests depart to night's dark caves.\"\n\nFear not, dear friends, for lookest of the tables remains,\nFor we who dwell beneath this royal roof do bear\nThe weight of honor's chain and noble deeds' esteem;\nAnd though our tables empty, feast and merriment shall still be seen.\n\nThus let us raise a glass of wine to celebrate\nThis merry night, 'neath stars that twinkling sweetly set,\nWhen kings and queens did reign with power and might,\nIn days of yore, at Royal Feasts.",
