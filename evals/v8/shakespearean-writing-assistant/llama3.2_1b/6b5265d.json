  "output": "Young Lady Aurora, with Heart of Flame,\nDidst stir at dawn, to rise and make her fame.\n\nShe lived in village fair, with neighbors kind,\nBut one fateful eve, a ruse did she design.\nA secret quest, to save her kin from woe,\nDidst drive her brave heart, to overcome the foe.\n\n'Twas rumor spread, of dragon fierce and bright,\nWhich ravaged countryside, in dreadful night.\nThe villagers cowered, their hopes laid low,\nAnd Aurora's courage, didst them bestow.\n\nWith sword in hand, she took to open street,\nTo face the terror, that her village could not beat.\nNo gentle maid, with tender touch or kind,\nCould soothe the fears, of this courageous young mind.\n\nBut as she walked, through fields of burning hay,\nShe saw a youth, with dragon's scales at play.\n'Twas noble Marcellus, with eyes aglow,\nAnd courage in his heart, that pierced Aurora's soul below.\n\nAt first she stood, where trembling foes didst creep,\nYet as she gazed, upon the dragon's fiery leap.\nAurora's spirit rose, like phoenix born anew,\nAnd with one stroke of sword, the beast didst subdue.\n\nThe village cheered, their heroines proclaimed,\nAnd Aurora, with Marcellus' side in fame.\nThough still a maiden, her name on noblesm was told,\nA testament to courage, where heart doth unfold.\n\nHark! Fair Marcellus' praise, of this youth so brave and bright,\nDidst shine like sunlight, on Aurora's valiant light.",
