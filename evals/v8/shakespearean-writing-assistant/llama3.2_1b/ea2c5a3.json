  "output": "Fair friends, thou hast requested a brief account of a most pleasant repast,\nA meetin' of the merry company, wherein we did engage in merriment and ease.\n\n'Twas at yonder little tavern, a humble den of mirth and gaiety,\nThat our dearest circle did gather to share a meal and camaraderie.\nThe sun shone bright in the sky above, castin' its cheerful ray\nAmidst the tables set with victuals fresh and fair.\n\nWe dined on roasted meats, steaming hot from ovens fine and true,\nAnd savory pies that filled our boards, both hunger and delight anew.\nThe clink of glasses did echo through the hallowed halls of cheer,\nAs we did toast the virtues of friendship, platonic bliss, this year.\n\nA plump joint of mutton, crispy bacon, 'twas served forth with glee,\nAnd alongside, a medley of steaming vegetables to set us free.\nIn company's delight, a pitcher full of ale did flow like wine,\nThat warmed our bellies and refreshed our spirits, forsooth divine.\n\nThus, in that merry bower of fellowship and convivial cheer,\nWe regaled each other with tales, jests, and mirthful moments rare.",
