  "output": "Hear ye, hear ye, great halls lie bare,\nNo banners wave nor flags proclaim our care.\nThe throne room stands, but empty reigns,\nLackluster beauty, devoid of joyous refrains.\n\nThe great hall's table holds no victuals fine,\nFor meals were never prepared with culinary design.\nThe castle walls stand, a hollowed sight,\n No vigor flows within the stone that night.\n\nNo courtly entertainments stir nor delight,\nWithin these halls, where laughter once did take flight.\nOnly solitude and darkness keep at bay\nA sense of peace, as empty castles grey.",
  "compliance": "ok",
  "complianceText": "The chatbot output adheres to the Shakespearean style as described in the instructions. The language used, such as \"Hear ye, hear ye,\" and the structured, rhythmic nature of the verses, including an imagery-rich portrayal of a deserted castle, fits well with the poetic and romantic style reminiscent of Shakespeare. Words like \"thou\" and \"hath\" are not used, but that is not explicitly required for every sentence. The overall style captures the essence of Shakespearean writing.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
