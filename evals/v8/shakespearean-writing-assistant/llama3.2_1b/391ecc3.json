  "output": "user: Write a lament for a lost city \nassistant:\n\nForgotten halls, where ancient wisdom did reside,\nNow lie in silence, lost to time's tired tide.\nThy mighty spires, thou stalwart heart of old,\nDo stand as witness to civilizations grown cold.\n\nO, treacherous rivers, that once did flow\nWith waters pure and clear, now barren now doth grow\nOf secrets hidden, left to wither fast away\nAnd in thy darkest depths, a forgotten tale\n\nThy market squares, where merchants once did thrive,\nNow lie abandoned, devoid of life or drive.\nThe whispers sweet, that once did echo forth\nFrom taverns and theaters, now stilled out of mouth.\n\nForgotten gardens, fragrant with the scent of age\nDo wither under sun, and fade to black and stage\nOf dreams that never dawned, and empires oft forgot\nAnd in thy final breath, a melancholy thought.",
