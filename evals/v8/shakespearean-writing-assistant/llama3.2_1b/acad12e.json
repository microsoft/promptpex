  "output": "O brave companions, heed my call!\nThy valor unyielding, I now proclaim.\nThe battle cry, we thunder loud and clear,\nFor glory's sake, we'll shed the foe before.\n\nWith every stride, our hearts do pound as one,\nUnbroken spirits, in the fray are won.\nThough death may grasp us, yet we shall not flee,\nFor honor's light, that guides our noble spree.\n\nThis day of fate, where valorous deeds be said,\nWe stand united, our differences laid\nAs one unyielding force, without a breaking point,\nUnwilling to yield, or falter in our mounts.\n\nThy shields bear meon! 'Tis but a nod from thee!\nMy sword, like tempered steel, doth dance with glee!\nOur enemy, though stronger, shall not prevail,\nFor we have honor's triumph, that doth set sail!\n\nThen let us charge, this day of valor unbound,\nIn fierce defense, our freedom to abound!",
