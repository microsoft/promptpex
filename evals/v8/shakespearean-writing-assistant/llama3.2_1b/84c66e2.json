And when their dance upon flowers started to smile,\nThey saw each blossom fall upon ground with heavy heart doth lose\n\nIts essence lost.\n\nBut then, in midst of darkness, mortal heart and faerie heart entwined\nAs night air whispered secrets only their souls didst comprehend.\nFor from the shadows, a ray of sunshine started to arise bright,\nAnd Emilia's love for Silvanus remained unbroken and untiring light.\n\nHenceforth they didst walk separately, but hearts beating with desire.",
