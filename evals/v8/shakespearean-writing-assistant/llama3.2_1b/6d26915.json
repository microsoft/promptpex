  "output": "Fair scribe, thou dost request a plain explanation,\nOf the celestial realm, which in darkness reigns.\n'Tis a vast expanse of heavenly bodies arrayed,\nIn constellations, that in twinkling light are swayed.\n\nThe sun, a fiery orb, doth set below the horizon's rim,\nLeaving naught but stars to twinkle, like diamonds in the din.\nThese constellations, ancient myths and legends hold,\nRegard'd as sacred deities, the celestial host.\n\nIn summer's length or winter's chill, when earth's surface is aglow,\nThe sky's dark canvas spreads, a velvet mantle low.\nThe aurora borealis, ethereal wisps, do dance and play,\nA fleeting spectacle, of wonder-filled display.\n\nThus, in the night's stillness, darkened universe we find\nA vast and mystic realm, where mystery and awe entwine.\nIn peaceful silence, 'tis there we ponder life's grand tale,\nAnd cosmic forces shape our world, without a human gale.",
