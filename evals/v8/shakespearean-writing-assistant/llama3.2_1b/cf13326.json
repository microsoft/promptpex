  "output": "Fair reader, gather 'round and heed my tale,\nOf Sir Valor, valiant knight, with valor unrelailed.\nIn days of yore, when honor was the highest deed,\n\n'Twas said that a noble maiden fair did dwell in a tower high.\nHer beauty was renowned, her wit didst catch a knight's eye.\n\nA wicked sorceress, with powers dark and deep,\nDidst cast a spell o'er maiden, to keep her from his keep.\nSir Valor, steadfast heart, with chivalry unbound,\nDidst vow to rescue fair Ellen, at the sorceress's command to be found.\n\nHe rode through mountains steep, and valleys fertile too,\nThrough raging rivers swift, where waters flowed anew.\nHis armor shone like gold, his steed was swift and true,\nAs he confronted foes, both fierce and wicked anew.\n\nAt last, he entered tower dark, with moonlight shining bright,\nAnd found fair Ellen bound, in chains by magic's spite.\nSir Valor rushed to her side, and with sword in hand didst say:\n\n\"Hark, thou foul witch! Thou shalt not have dominion o'er this land.\nMy lady dear is free; I'll vanquish thee, and thy wicked hold.\"\n\nThe sorceress snarled, her powers fierce and loud,\nBut Sir Valor stood tall, with honor unbound.\nHe slew the minions, and with one final blow\nDidst strike down witch, in defeat, his armor didst know.\n\nWith fair Ellen safe, he rode forth once more,\nThrough battles won and glory scored.\nAnd as they journeyed on, their hearts entwined as one,\nTheir love didst flourish, beneath a warm sun.\n\nSir Valor, knight of honor, with heart of gold,\nDidst conquer all, his spirit bold.\nHis bravery in tale, is forever told,\nThat he who loves true honor, shall never grow old.",
