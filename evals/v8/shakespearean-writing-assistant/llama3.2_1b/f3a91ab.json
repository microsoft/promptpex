  "output": "Thou hast begun, most noble patron,\nA tale of legend, born of strife and fight.\nIn days of yore, when eastern winds did moan,\nAnd sun-kissed fields were won by rival armies' throne,\n\nAmidst this clash, a hero of renown was found,\nSir Ector de Montjoye, with sword in crown,\nWhose valor unyielding conquered every test,\nAnd in the fray, his name etched as one who best.\n\nThe enemy, a horde of Norman knights so dire,\nWith gleaming steel and armor, did their fierce ire\nUnleash upon Sir Ector, with each passing charge,\nTheir deadly aim, to rend his shield, and end his care.\n\nAt once, the noble knight charged, with steed in flight,\nHis shield to greet the coming stormy night,\nThe clash of arms resounded through both ranks so bold,\nAs two armies locked, their honor, honor's golden fold.\n\nSir Ector valiantly deflected blows so sharp and fine,\nAnd struck back fierce, his courage left untarnished divine,\nThough outnumbered, he held his ground with steadfast might,\nHis valor unbroken, like a beacon in the night.\n\nIn endearing token, Norman knights beheld his stead,\nA shining armor, reflecting honor's noble deed,\nThus won to fame, Sir Ector stood as fallen from their ranks,\nUnvanquished hero, who in valiant deeds entwined\n\nThen cheered did voices echo 'cross battlefields and high,\nFor courage is their name the greatest glory 'twixt life\nAnd legend shall in lore forever stand, thy spirit immortalised\nUntextual.",
