  "output": "O, fairest mortal, with heart afire and soul forlorn,\nThy name is whispered low of downfall's darkest morn.\n'Tis that of noble hearts, whose courage doth succumb\nTo fate's cruel hand, in a most woeful tomb.\n\nHis eyes, like darkest sapphires, shining bright and cold,\nReflected all hope's last gleams, now extinguished, untold.\nHis lips, once plump with promise, now parched and dry,\nDo whisper sorrow's sighs, as tears from mortal eye do fly.\n\nHis tressed hair, once dark-kiss'ed, with secrets unrevealed,\nNow hangs in lank disarray, like a mourner's veil revealed.\nHis skin, once smooth as Alabaster, now dulled and worn,\nDoth glow with redness, 'gainst sun's pale light, forlorn.\n\nHis garments, stained with toil, and threads of sorrow spun,\nDo tell the tale of struggles oft, in secret, un undone.\nA hero, forged in trials crucible, where fire did burn,\nBut pride, ambition's deadly snake, hath brought him down sworn.\n\nHis hands, once firm as mountain peaks, now tremble with despair,\nAs if the weight of fate's dark wings had cast him there.\nHis feet, that erst did stride through battles fierce and long,\nNow falter on the ground, like specters in a mournful song.\n\nAnd thou, dear friend, who thy lord invites to share\nIn his downfall's glory, hast thou not foreseen this dire care?\n Hast thou not sensed, that thine own heart doth beat with woe?\nOr hath thy heart been charmed by fancy's fragile glow?",
