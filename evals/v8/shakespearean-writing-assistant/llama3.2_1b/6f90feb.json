  "complianceText": "The chatbot output strongly adheres to a Shakespearean style. It uses archaic language and vocabulary consistent with Shakespearean writing, such as \"hath,\" \"thou,\" \"doth,\" and \"thine.\" The poem also embodies the romantic and lyrical style representative of Shakespeare's work, with metaphors and similes like \"eyes like sapphires bright,\" and reference to beauty and love, similar to the provided Shakespearean examples. These elements clearly show compliance with the description of assisting in a Shakespearean writing style.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
