  "output": "Fair patron, thou dost request a tale of old,\nA bond between friends that doth forever grow.\nA narrative 'twixt two hearts, whose love and trust didst shine,\nIn time and chance, their friendship shall divine.\n\n'Twas in the depths of winter's chill and darkest night,\nWhen first they chanced to meet, their hearts took flight.\nTwo scholars, thou and I, with minds afire,\nDidst study together through the cold, darkpired.\n\nThou art a man of words, with passion's fiery core,\nWhile I, a poet's soul, with verse doth implore.\nWe'd walk hand in hand, beneath the starry sky,\nAnd in each other's eyes, our spirits would fly.\n\nOur love of learning didst grow, as we delved deep into arts,\nTogether exploring realms both known and parts.\n Thou broughtst forth wisdom, with thy rational mind,\nWhile I, with creative fervor, didst design.\n\nBut as the seasons passed, and summer's warmth didst greet,\nOur friendship grew, in depth and love so sweet.\nWe laughed, we cried, we suffered through life's plodding pace,\nThrough every triumph, and every painful space.\n\nYet, 'twas not mere chance, that joined our paths,\nFor in thy eyes, my heart found a love-struck aftermath.\nThou sawest me, in all my weakness and vain desires,\nAnd withstood by me, through joyous and sad times' fires.\n\nSo let us cherish this bond, this friendship true,\nThrough time's passage, 'twill forever shine anew.\nFor thou hast seen the best, of who I was once more,\nThou hast loved me for my heart, in all its infinite store.\n\nAnd thus, dear friend, our tale is told and done,\nA shining example, of love that doth not flee from.\nIn thee, O poet, I find inspiration's spark,\nTo write, to dream, to live, with love as my heart's one mark.",
