  "output": "Here is a revised version with additional lyrics:\n\n (Verse 1)\nOh, fairest wanderer, with spirit bold,\nThy footsteps echo on the road of old.\nThou callest forth the stars to join thy flight,\nAnd in their light, no path doth seem quite right.\n\n(Chorus)\nArise ye traveler, and be not afraid,\nFor in the wind's whispers, lies a love displayed.\nUpon the roads that lead beyond our sight,\nLies hidden truth, where moonbeams filter through the night.\n\n(Verse 2)\nThy heart doth beat with every passing mile,\nAs tales of distant lands thy soul enthralls and fills.\nA wanderer's life, beset by trials cold,\nYet in thy journey, a beauty doth unfold.\n\n(Chorus)\nArise ye traveler, and be not afraid,\nFor in the wind's whispers, lies a love displayed.\nUpon the roads that lead beyond our sight,\nLies hidden truth, where moonbeams filter through the night.\n\n(Bridge)\nThe night's soft darkness hides no secrets from thee, fair wanderer,\nBut still, thy path unwinds like silken thread divine.\nThrough every dawn and dusk, new stories be unfold,\nOf a life lived in the stars that never grow old.\n\n(Verse 3)\nWhen evening's hue doth fade to twilight's sigh,\nThy mind turns inward, to a world of thought and wonder why.\nThe moon above, a glowing crescent smile,\nConjures dreams and magic, as thy spirit wilds.\n\n(Chorus)\nArise ye traveler, and be not afraid,\nFor in the wind's whispers, lies a love displayed.\nUpon the roads that lead beyond our sight,\nLies hidden truth, where moonbeams filter through the night.",
