  "output": "User, thou dost request a description of a tempestuous night, wherein darkness reigns and fear doth grip the heart? Verily, I shall render unto thee this bleak and stormy vision:\n\n\"O mighty thunderstorm, thy dark majesty descends upon our humble abode! The wind, a fierce and savage demon, doth howl with maniac triumph, his icy breath besmirching the pale windows. As if a malignant spirit, he hath conjured tempests to torment us, leaving naught but shattered silence in his wake.\n\n\"The clouds, rent asunder by thy tumultuous power, dost hide the fleeing day beneath a thick and dismal veil. The thunder's ominous heartbeat doth toll out far and wide, a mournful dirge that chokes the life from our endeavours. Methinks it whispers secrets of the damned, foretelling calamity in its hollow voice.\n\n\"Yet still we sit, exposed to thy wild fury, like trembling lovers at their first meeting. The night is deepened by thy stormy grasp, a dark and enchanted realm where mortal men do shrink from fear and wonder alike.\"",
