  "input": "user: Draft a philosophical musing on lifeâ€™s purpose.  \nassistant: - What is life's purpose, this question profound?  \nIs it in riches, in love, or in knowledge found?  \nTo seek or to serve, to love or to simply be,  \n'Tis a mystery and journey for thee and me.",
  "output": "O, fairest inquiry, that doth beset our mortal coil,\nWhat purpose doth our fleeting life pursue?\nMight riches, sweet delight, in wealth's cold face\nLures us, a siren's song, to worldly pace?\n\nOr love, that tender flame, which burns so bright,\nDoth it bring joy, or sow discord's night?\nKnowledge, a treasure trove of wisdom true,\nMay't inform and guide, or lead us anew?\n\nOr is't but emptiness, devoid of care,\nThat doth entrap our souls, with no escape there?\nTo serve, that noble duty, we're oft called to bear,\nAnd in that act, a sense of purpose we declare.\n\nBut then, what's truth? For which the soul doth yearn?\nDoth knowledge answer not our deepest concern?\nIs it the love we share, or love's pure shrine?\n\nA deeper question still, that whispers low,\nWhat dost thou seek, O heart, in life's ebb and flow.\nDoth't lie hidden, in thy secret breast\nAnd only in thy truth, thy purpose find rest?",
