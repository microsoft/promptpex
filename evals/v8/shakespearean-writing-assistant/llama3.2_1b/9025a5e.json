  "output": "**A Tale of Forbidden Love**\n\nIn sooth, fair maidens, gather 'round and heed my words,\nOf two hearts bound by love, yet forced to be unheard.\n\n'Twas in the sweltering summer heat, when Venice' streets were wide,\nThat our star-cross'd lovers first didst meet, side by side.\nTheir eyes did dance, like stars above the sea,\nAnd hearts, in secret whispers, didth converse with glee.\n\nFair Lucia, a beauty, with tresses golden bright,\nDid capture mine heart's affections. She, a maiden fair and light,\nShone bright as Phoebus' rays upon the morning dew.\nOur love didst flourish, like a garden, full of promise anew.\n\nBut alas, fair Lucia's family, they didst disapprove\nOf our unlikeliest union, to love one another, forsooth.\nThey whispered secrets, in hidden taverns, and darkling glades,\nOf our forbidden love, and how it wouldst bring forth dreadful shades.\n\nThy father, stern and cold, didst deem me unfit for thee,\nA lowly wretch, unworthy of thy noble name and dew.\nYet I didst love her dear, with all my heart and soul,\nAnd vowed to win her hand, against the raging storms of gold.\n\nBut soft, what light through yonder window breaks tonight?\n'Tis she, fair Lucia, with candlelight, doth shine so bright!\nThe shadows quiver, like leaves upon the autumn tree,\nAs I do witness their love, and my heart's passion be.\n\nOh, cruel fate! Our whispers were not loud enough to sway\nHer father's heart from his resolve, nor mine own will.\nYet still, our hearts beat swift, in secret and in prayer,\nFor love doth conquer all, even time and bitter care.\n\nOne night, I stole into her chamber, with stealthy steps so fine,\nAnd there, beneath the moon's pale beams, didst make my love divine.\nBut soft! Her father heard me, and with a heavy heart didst speak:\n\"Fie on this wretched youth!\" And turned his back, as one who'd rather seek.\n\nAha! I'd found the one! Ah, fair Lucia, now behold\nMy passion's triumph, in plain sight. Shall we defy all fate,\nAnd make our love shine forth, like Phoebus' radiant light?\nOr shall I kneel and beg for mercy, to save my honor from night?\n\nNay, let us do nothing yet! 'Tis best, to bide our time,\nLest whispers spread, and our secret hearts be sealed in thine.\n\nAnd thus we stand, fair friends, like stars that shun the sun's gaze,\nUncertain what shall come, but love, in secret, still amazes.\n\n**The End**",
