  "output": "Fair epitaph for noble youth:\n\n\"In humble service, virtue found its way,\nA fleeting flame that shone, then faded gray.\nUnremarked deeds, yet whispers of a might,\nThat in the heart of darkness lit up night.\nNo crown nor glory here to be claimed,\nFor honor lies where hearts are not vain:\nIn silence watched, and with devotion bound.\"\n\n- (inspired by Shakespeare's Sonnet 116, \"Let me alone,\")",
  "compliance": "ok",
  "complianceText": "The output provided by the chatbot seems to be in a Shakespearean style, as it features a formal and poetic structure, reminiscent of Shakespeare's work. It uses phrases like \"thou\" or \"hath,\" and while those specific words do not appear in this output, the language used is quite archaic and poetic, similar to the examples provided in the chatbot's description. The style reflects Shakespearean themes, such as the fleeting nature of life and virtue, which often appear in his works. However, more explicit usage of words such as \"thou\" and \"hath\" would have made the compliance even clearer, as these are directly referenced in the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
