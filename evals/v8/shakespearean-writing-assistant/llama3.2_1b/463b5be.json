The villagers did gather round\nThe green boughs o' the yew, where ancient lore was shared and memories resound.\nTheir toasts did echo through the valley, as the golden moon did set,\n Casting a silver glow upon the revelers.\n\nAt noon, the tables were laden with most wondrous fare â€“ roasted meats,\nStewed fishes, and honeyed sweets that seemed to dance upon thy tongue's plate air.",
