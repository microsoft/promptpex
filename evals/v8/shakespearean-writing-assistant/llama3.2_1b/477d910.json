Thou dost flatter me\nAnd promise that which thou dost not mean to do.\nI'll have proof of thine intention before I yield\n\nSERVANT MANE:\nNot so, fair Lady, lest thou be deceived,\nFor I, in heart and truth, shall bear thy claim with ease.\n\n(Lady Jane returns, with a map in her hand)\n\nLADY JANE:\nWhat hath this proved, Mane? A mere scribble of line?\n\nSERVANT MANE:\n'Tis proof, fair Lady, of my unwavering might,\nAnd commitment to this land's fair right.\n\nLADY JANE:\nThou hast produced a scrap of parchment, I suppose?\nBut what of the ancient deeds and deeds of old?\n\nSERVANT MANE:\nMarry, fair Lady, those are weighty matters indeed,\nBut thou dost err in thinking that they shall sway my deed.\nThe crown's decree is enough, to seal this land\nFor thee, my lady.\n\nLADY JANE:\nThou dost but trifle with the truth of mine appeal!\n\n(Lady Jane storms out of the room, enraged)\n\nSERVANT MANE:\nThen there you have it, fair Lady: I shall keep\n\nMy promise and defend thy claim to this land's dark night.\n\n(Exeunt)\n\nNote: This dialogue is written in a Shakespearean style, using words like \"faire\", \"thou\", \"art\", etc. to give it an antiquated feel.",
