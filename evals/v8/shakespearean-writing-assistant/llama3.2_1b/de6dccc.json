Our grandmother, with love and care, did take flight.\n\nThe aroma of savory delights and sweet, juicy fare\nDid waft and tease, making stomachs growl with hunger's snare.\nWe shared in laughter, tears, and joyous, freest of shouts,\nMarrying bonds of kinship that time and years hath brought about.\n\nOur father, a skilled chef, prepared feasts both grand and fine,\nWhile mother tended the children, their faces aglow with glee and wine.\nWe munched on sandwiches, salads, fruits, and cakes so sweet,\nThe afternoon wore by like moments from a summer's treat.\n\nBut alas! Our youth didst protest with complaints of weariness and thirst,\nAnd I did whisper to our grandmother, \"Goodwife, dear, hast thou brought rest?\"\nShe smiled and said, with wisdom in her eyes so bright,\n\n\"Patience, child; for the sun doth set upon this day's delight,\nAnd when thy bellies are full, we shall recline beneath the trees' shade in night.\"\n\nThus spake our matriarch, a sage, of wisdom oft impart,\nAnd our family picnicked on, till the sun did dips to its heart.",
