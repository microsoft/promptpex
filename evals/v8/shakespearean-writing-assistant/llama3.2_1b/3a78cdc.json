  "output": "Fair sir or madam,\n\n'Tis but a whisper of a tale,\nA cautionary yarn, to soothe the pain,\nOf one who wandereth through life's plight,\nIn search of love, and a heart that doth gain.\n\nIn distant realms, a prince didst dwindle away,\nIn solitude, and a melancholy sway.\nHis kingdom's wars had left him poor,\nAnd with them, hope, didst swiftly leave at once.\n\nHe wandered, lost, through forest deep and wide,\nWhere trees do shade the lonely prince's stride.\nThe rustling leaves didst whisper secrets sweet,\nAs he sat down to weep, his heart did make.\n\nAlas! Oh woe was him, in every fiber cold,\nFor love had left him, young and grown old.\nNo maiden fair, with beauty to behold,\nDidst capture his heart, nor tales of gold.\n\nHis mind did turn to memories of youth's fire,\nWhen first he beheld the sunrise higher.\nIn dreams, he'd see her smile so bright and fair,\nAnd in that vision, all pain didst scatter air.\n\nBut alas! For now, 'tis nigh unto night,\nThe fires burn low, the candles burnt out of sight.\nHis bed doth weep, his tears fall like rain,\nAs in his dreams, love's phantom doth remain.\n\nYet still he sits, a lonely soul forlorn,\nLonging for tenderness that once he felt born.\nFarewell, fair prince! May Fortune see to it thou shalt find,\nAnother heart's kiss, and comfort of the mind.",

Additionally, the output takes the form of a poetic narrative, exploring themes of love, solitude, and melancholyâ€”common topics in Shakespeare's works.
