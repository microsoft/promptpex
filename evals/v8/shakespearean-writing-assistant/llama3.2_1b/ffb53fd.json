  "output": "Fair maiden, thou dost pose thy question dear,\nTo one who doth proclaim in verse my secret long-held fear:\nThat though I lay aflame with passion's fervent might,\nMy heart doth tell a different tale, a sorrowful plight.\n\n'Tis not the fire that burns within me true,\nBut rather hidden passions that my soul doth pursue.\nMethinks thou dost perceive in me a love so kind,\nYet oft 'tis but a fleeting dream of passion's confounded mind.\n\nMy breast doth beat with ardent longing, night and day,\nFor one whose gentle smile hath lit my darkest way.\nBut like the nightingale that singeth sweet delight,\nMy heart doth whisper secrets to the shadows' dark of night.\n\nOh, cruel fate, why dost thou take from me this love so true?\nA pang of sorrow cuts like winter's bitter dew.\nFor in thy absence, my soul doth feel a hollowed-out sea,\nWhere once thy laughter echoed sweet and full of glee.\n\nYet still I hold on to hope, a slender thread of cheer,\nThat someday thou mayst perceive the passion that doth yearn to hear.\nFor love, like sunshine brightened for my heart's despair,\nMay one day bring solace to this lovesick poet's snare.",
