  "output": "Thou darkening veil doth shroud the mystic wood,\nAs night's stern hand, in ebony and red,\nDoth wrap the trees, like sentinels of old,\nIn dismal shadow. The wind, a mournful sigh,\nDoth whisper through the branches, cold and gray,\nThe rustling leaves, a soft, eerie sigh.\n\nThe moon, a ghostly galleon, hideth its face,\nWhile darkness reigns, with silent, watchful pace,\nThe forest floor, a whispered, secret place,\nWhere few dare tread, and fewer still find their way.\n\nThy trees, like skeletal fingers, reach towards the night's dark throne,\nTheir limbs outstretched, as if in awe or fright;\nTheir branches creak, a mournful, haunting sound,\nAs if the forest itself did weep and mourn aloud.\nThe shadows dance, a mysterious, ghostly throng,\nThat follows thee, and keeps its distance long.",
