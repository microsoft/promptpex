  "output": "Fair patron, thou dost entrust mine hand\nTo craft a sonnet of devotion's fire,\nA poetic outpouring, gentle as the land:\n\nMy heart doth beat for thee alone this night,\nMy thoughts are filled with sweet and tender dreams,\nThat in thine eyes, my soul hath found its right,\nAnd love's pure flame, that burns within my breast gleams.\n\nThy touch, a lover's gentle caress,\nDoth stir my passion, and my heart doth sing,\nA sweet melody of love's deepness,\nThat in thine arms, I long to cling.\n\nBut alas, fair one, thou must decline\nMy ardent words, for duty calls me hence,\nAnd from thy presence, I must take a leave\nTo answer, obligations of fate and force.\n\nYet still, my love for thee doth hold me fast,\nA constant flame that in thine love will last.",
