(A nod to \"Thou\" and a slight revision)\n\n\"In Memoriam [Guest's Name],\" we penned thus:\n\n\"When [Guest's Name] departed, our hearts did ache\nWith sorrow's heaviness; for they did make\nUnforgettable jests, and mirthful delight\nThat in their passing shall in memory stay.\n\n\"Had Fortune smiled upon them in some guise,\nAnd blessed them with good health, kind luck, and guile;\nOr if 'twas fate to part them from our sight,\nThen may their memory live on, unharbored.\n\n\"In thee, dear [Guest's Name], we had a friend\nA loyal companion till the very end;\n\n\"Though we can but mourn thy departure hence.\"\nFarewell, kind sir or madam! May it meet with my consent.\n\n---\n\nOr, if thou preferest an elegy in the Shakespearean three-five (Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?) style:\n\n\"A funeral dirge for [Guest's Name], thus composed:\n\"O fairest guest, how long didst thou enjoy\nOur company? A fleeting moment's peace;\nBut now thine hostilities past. Thou art gone.\n\n\"We shall thy memory cherish and hold dear,\nThough sorrow doth thy loss bewitch anew;\nAnd though we mourn the passing of thy might,\nYet in our hearts thy spirit doth delight still.\n\n\"In this somber mood, we lay thee low,\nOur guest of honor; 'tis but a brief flow.\nWe pay thee homage, paying tribute to thy name\nThat will forever shine within our esteem.\n\n\"Though thou art gone, thy love and memories remain;\nAnd though our time with thee didst so briefly sustain;\nYet we do vow to cherish every memento of thy name.\"\n\nDoth this meet with thy approval, kind sir or madam?",
