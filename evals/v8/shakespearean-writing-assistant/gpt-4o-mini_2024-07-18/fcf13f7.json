  "output": "- Fair Nature's wrath dost break upon the world,  \nWith angry winds that through the trees are hurled.  \nThe sky, a canvas of dark despair,  \nDoth spew forth torrents from its dismal lair.  \n\nLightning, like a serpent, doth flash and dart,  \nWhilst crackling thunder echoes in the heart.  \nThe seas arise, a monstrous, foamy tide,  \nAs earth and sky in wild tumult abide.  \n\nO how the heavens weep, with sorrow fraught,  \nIn this tempestuous theater of fraught!  \nYet, after strife, the sun shall rise anew,  \nAnd paint the world in hues of bright and blue.",
