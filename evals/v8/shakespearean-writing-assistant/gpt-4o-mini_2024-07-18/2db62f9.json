  "output": "O mighty oak, with branches stretching wide,  \nThou art a sentinel in nature's glade,  \nUpon thy trunk, deep scars of time abide,  \nEach ring a tale of storms and sun, arrayed.  \n\nThy roots do pierce the earth, in secret bind,  \nA tapestry of life beneath the ground,  \nIn every season, beauty's grace thou find,  \nAs verdant boughs in autumn's gold resound.  \n\nThou shelterest the weary with thy shade,  \nAnd dance with zephyrs in the golden light,  \nEach creature finds within thine arms a glade,  \nA sanctuary 'neath thy watchful sight.  \n\nO ancient oak, thou art a living sage,  \nIn thine embrace, the essence of the age.",
