  "output": "O treacherous heart that harbors deceit,  \nWhat venomous breath hath fueled this foul act?  \nIn the garden of trust, thou didst tread soft,  \nYet concealed beneath blossoms, thorns hath thou packed.  \n\nA bond once woven with threads of pure gold,  \nNow frays in the shadow where darkness takes hold.  \nDidst thou not swear by the heavens above,  \nTo guard mine heart with thine own oath of love?  \n\nBut, lo! Even the sweetest of fruits may decay,  \nDeceit, like a serpent, hath led thee astray.  \nIn thine eyes, once kind, betrayal now gleams,  \nA tempest ensnares my once radiant dreams.  \n\nOft have I trusted the light in thine soul,  \nYet now I see naught but a gaping hole.  \nFor what is a friendship when faith is a ghost?  \nA feast of fond memories now turned to a roast.  \n\nYet I shall rise, though this wound cuts me deep,  \nFor through the tempest, my spirit shall keep.  \nNo longer a pawn to thy treacherous game,  \nI reclaim my heart; thy betrayal, in shame.
