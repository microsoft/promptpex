  "output": "In twilight's gentle grasp, where shadows play,  \nI wandered forth, by moonlight led astray.  \nLo, out from yonder thicket, bright and fair,  \nThere beckoned nymphs, with silken, flowing hair.  \n\nTheir laughter chimed, as silver bells doth ring,  \nWith mischief twinkling in their eyes, they sing.  \n\"Come hither, mortal, join our merry throng,  \nFor in our realm, thou'lt find where thou dost belong.\"  \n\nThen from the mist, a graceful griffin soared,  \nWith feathered wings and lion's heart, adored.  \nHe landed soft, in silence, bold and grand,  \nWith a gaze that pierced, as though he knew my hand.  \n\nA whisper of enchantment filled the air,  \nAs sylphs in circles danced without a care.  \n\"Fear not, dear child, for magicâ€™s here to stay,  \nIn nature's heart, the wondrous finds its play.\"  \n\nThus, in that sacred wood, I lost all time,  \nEnraptured by surreal and grand sublime.  \nWith every creature, mystical and rare,  \nI found a world beyond, untainted, fair.",
