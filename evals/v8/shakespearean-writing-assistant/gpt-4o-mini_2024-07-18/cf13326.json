  "output": "In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,  \nThere dwelt a knight, Sir Alaric, strong and keen.  \nWith armor gleaming 'neath the radiant sun,  \nHe sought a quest, a challenge to be won.  \n\nA dreadful dragon, fierce of tooth and claw,  \nDid strike the village, breaching peace with awe.  \nThe fair maid Elowen, with hair like spun gold,  \nWas taken captive, her tale left untold.  \n\nSir Alaric, with heart both pure and brave,  \nDid vow to rescue her from the dragon's cave.  \nHe mounted steed, both proud and fleet of foot,  \nThrough forest dark, where shadows dared to shoot.  \n\nUpon the mountains high, 'neath skies so grey,  \nHe found the beast that made the heavens sway.  \nWith fiery breath, the dragon roared with might,  \nYet Alaric, undeterred, stood firm to fight.  \n\nWith sword drawn high and valor in his breast,  \nA clash did echo—none could him contest.  \nAnd after battle raged, with courage bright,  \nHe struck the beast, restoring peace and light.  \n\nWhen Elowen, in chains of sorrow bound,  \nDid see her hero, with joy she unbound.  \nTogether they returned to lands of grace,  \nA love kindled, 'neath Fate’s most sweet embrace.  \n\nThus, Sir Alaric earned his noble fame,  \nA knight of honor, everlasting name.  \nForever sung in ballads and in lore,  \nHis tale of courage shall endure evermore.",
