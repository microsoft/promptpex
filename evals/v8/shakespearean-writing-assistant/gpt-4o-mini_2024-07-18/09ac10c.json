  "output": "In yonder castle's hallowed hall, where grand tapestries do sway,  \nThere lies a table richly spread, for lords and ladies gay.  \nWith silver goblets shining bright and platters heaped so high,  \nThe fragrant feast doth tempt the sense, as scents of roast supply.  \n\nThe king, a noble sovereign, doth grace the head of table,  \nWith regal mien and laughter sweet, he doth his court enable.  \nTo him, fair maidens weave their songs, whilst gallant knights do rise,  \nWith valor in their hearty speeches, seeking favor in his eyes.  \n\nLo! The dishes rich and rare, a banquet fit for kings:  \nRoasted peacock, dressed in gold, where fragrant spice doth cling;  \nAnd venison, so tender served, with sauce of elderberry,  \nWhile fruits of summer, plump and ripe, lie nestled, bright and merry.  \n\nThe minstrels play sweet melodies, their strains enchant the air,  \nWhilst jesters, clad in motley garb, doth take to stage with flair.  \nAs laughter blossoms 'round the hall, so bright the spirits soar,  \nYet shadows linger, whispers stir, of secrets, plots, and more.  \n\nFor midst the mirth, a tension grows, as eyes do glance askance,  \nA lady fair, with heart aflame, doth seize her fleeting chance.  \nWith love's bold glance, she calls the knight, whom she hath long adored,  \nBut courtly woes and jealous hearts make peace a fleeting chord.  \n\nThus, 'neath the chandeliers of light, where joy and danger meet,  \nThe royal feast doth dance with fate, in laughter and deceit.  \nThe night unfolds, a splendid tale, of feasting, mirth, and wine,  \nA tapestry of life and love, where joy and sorrow twine.
