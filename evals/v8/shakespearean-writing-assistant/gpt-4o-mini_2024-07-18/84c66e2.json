  "output": "In a verdant glade where the sun doth shine bright,  \nDid dwell a rabbit, fair and full of delight.  \nHer name was Floria, with fur soft as cream,  \nA creature of mirth, and of laughter, a dream.  \n\nOne day as she frolicked, mid daisies aglow,  \nShe spied a sly serpent, who moved with such flow.  \n“Good morrow, sweet Floria!” hissed he, with a grin,  \n“I prithee, come hither, let us be akin!”  \n\nBut Floria, wise, and with caution akin,  \nSaid, “Nay, my fine serpent, thy words are but sin!  \nFor thou hast a visage both cunning and sly,  \nTo trust thee, dear serpent, is surely to die.”  \n\nYet the serpent, beguiling, spun tales rich and grand,  \nHe spoke of a treasure, golden, so grand:  \n“’Tis hidden within yonder glimmering brook,  \nA bounty of jewels—come, take a fair look!”  \n\nWith eyes wide in wonder, Floria did say,  \n“A treasure, thou sayest? How glorious the day!”  \nBut wisdom, like whisper, did tug at her heart,  \n“Beware of sweet serpent, deceit is his art.”  \n\nStill tempted by visions of treasures untold,  \nFloria did follow, her fortune to hold.  \nBut when at the brook, she beheld not a gem,  \nNay, only the serpent, with malice to stem.  \n\n“Ha! Foolish young rabbit!” the serpent did sneer,  \n“Thou shouldst have been wary, for thou art not near!  \nThe treasure thou sought was but thine own good sense,  \nNow trapped in my grasp, thou dost face recompense!”  \n\nBut quick-witted Floria, with heart full of fire,  \nDid leap with great fervor and caught him by surprise.  \nWith one mighty bound, she escaped from his grasp,  \nAnd dashed through the thicket, a swift little asp.  \n\nThus learned she the lesson that all creatures must heed:  \nNot all that glitters is true; oft it doth lead,  \nTo perilous places where danger doth dwell,  \nTrust not every serpent, or bid farewell.  \n\nSo tell now this tale to the young and the bold,  \nThat wisdom and caution should never grow cold.  \nFor in forests and meadows, where shadows do play,  \nTrue treasure lies not in gold, but in wisdom’s sway.",
