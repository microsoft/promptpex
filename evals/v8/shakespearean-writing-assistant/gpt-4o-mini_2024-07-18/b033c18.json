  "output": "- Hark! The heralding of dawn doth paint the skies,  \nAs gentle rays of Sol begin to rise.  \nThe slumbering world doth stretch with soft delight,  \nIn hues of amber gold, dispersing night.  \n\nThe dewdrops glisten like a myriad of pearls,  \nUpon the verdant leaves, where morning swirls.  \nBirds, with songs of joy, do greet the morn,  \nWhile blooms unfold their petals, newly born.  \n\nThe tranquil hush that blankets earth doth wane,  \nIn anticipation of the dayâ€™s sweet reign.  \nJoyous is the hour, as shadows take their flight,  \nFor in this dawning hour, hope doth ignite.",
