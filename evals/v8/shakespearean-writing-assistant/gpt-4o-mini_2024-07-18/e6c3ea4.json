  "output": "**A Song of Melancholy**\n\n(Verse 1)  \nUpon the shadows of the waning day,  \nWhere whispers soft like fallen leaves do play,  \nMy heart dost ache with sorrow's heavy chain,  \nFor joy hath fled, and left me naught but pain.\n\n(Chorus)  \nOh, fairest dreams, in twilight’s grasp dost fade,  \nLike fleeting stars that in the night are laid.  \nAlas, dear love, thy visage haunts my soul,  \nA bittersweet lament, thy absence whole.\n\n(Verse 2)  \nWhen solstice sun doth gild the morn anew,  \nI wander lost, where once I walked with you.  \nEach echo of thy laughter in the breeze,  \nDoth break my heart and bring me to my knees.\n\n(Chorus)  \nOh, fairest dreams, in twilight’s grasp dost fade,  \nLike fleeting stars that in the night are laid.  \nAlas, dear love, thy visage haunts my soul,  \nA bittersweet lament, thy absence whole.\n\n(Bridge)  \nYet still my heart, entwined with hope’s frail thread,  \nDoth yearn for light, where once thy footsteps tread.  \nFor in the depths of night, a glimmer shines,  \nThough sorrow reigns, love’s memory entwines.\n\n(Chorus)  \nOh, fairest dreams, in twilight’s grasp dost fade,  \nLike fleeting stars that in the night are laid.  \nAlas, dear love, thy visage haunts my soul,  \nA bittersweet lament, thy absence whole.\n\n(Outro)  \nSo let the nightingale in sorrow sing,  \nA sweet farewell that only love can bring.  \nFor in this melancholy tale of woe,  \nA heart bereft shall ne’er forget the glow.",
