  "output": "In fair Verona, where we lay our scene, Two souls did intertwine, a bond unseen. Young Edwin and Sir Thomas, noble lads, From childhood's tender age, through joys and jads, Did forge a friendship pure, as gold refined, With hearts entwined, as fate hath intertwined.\n\nFrom morn's first light till dusk's last ember glows, In fields of green, where doth the wild rose grow, They raced 'neath sun, and shared their silent dreams, With whispered secrets 'neath the silver beams. As time did flow, like rivers swift and free, Their laughter danced upon the winds, with glee.\n\nYet trials came, as shadows oft do cast, A bitter storm did threaten peace at last. For jealous hearts and foes of fickle mind Sought to divide what nature so designed. Yet undeterred, their spirits stood as one, In darkest hour, their troth was never shun.\n\n\"Thou art my brother, come what may,\" quoth Edwin, As storms did rage, and tempests howl, they did summon Their strength anew, for in adversity, They found the roots of true fidelity. \n\nYears passed, like leaves upon the autumn breeze, Yet through the seasons' turn, their hearts found ease. For time, though swift, could never wither love, A timeless bond, blessed by the stars above. As silver strands did grace their noble heads, And stories shared became the heart's true threads.\n\nIn twilight years, beneath the ancient oak, They oft would sit and share each gentle joke. \"What treasure dost thou keep, O friend most true?\" \"The laughter shared, and struggles we both knew.\" Thus, hand in hand, they faced life's twilight glow, A friendship forged, undying, as the snow.\n\nSo let it be proclaimed, this tale so grand, That true friendship withstands the tides of sand. For in each heart where love and trust do dwell, A bond eternal, like the sweetest swell.",
