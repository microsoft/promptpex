  "output": "**A Ballad of the Lost Ship**\n\n*Verse 1:*  \nUpon the restless waves so wide,  \nThere lies a ship, her fate belied.  \nWith sails of white, she once did glide,  \nNow, dimmed her light, her crew hath cried.\n\n*Chorus:*  \nO lost ship of the tempest’s wrath,  \nWherefore dost thou roam on fate’s cold path?  \nThe stars above, they weep and sigh,  \nFor thou art cast 'neath the stormy sky.\n\n*Verse 2:*  \nThe winds do howl, with voices dire,  \nThe darkened clouds, they gather higher.  \nNo solace found in the sea’s swift embrace,  \nFor the heart of the mariner knows not grace.\n\n*Chorus:*  \nO lost ship of the tempest’s wrath,  \nWherefore dost thou roam on fate’s cold path?  \nThe stars above, they weep and sigh,  \nFor thou art cast 'neath the stormy sky.\n\n*Bridge:*  \nIn dreams of home, their thoughts do stray,  \nTo shores long gone, where they would play.  \nYet now they sail on a ghostly tide,  \nWith hope as frail as the evening’s glide.\n\n*Verse 3:*  \nSo raise a glass to those who roam,  \nIn depths unknown, ‘tis not their home.  \nA sailor’s heart, forever free,  \nYet oft it aches for the land and lea.\n\n*Chorus:*  \nO lost ship of the tempest’s wrath,  \nWherefore dost thou roam on fate’s cold path?  \nThe stars above, they weep and sigh,  \nFor thou art cast 'neath the stormy sky.\n\n*Outro:*  \nSo let the tale be told anew,  \nOf the ship adrift, where the wild winds blew.  \nFor in the hearts of those who dare,  \nLies the spirit of the sea, beyond compare.",
