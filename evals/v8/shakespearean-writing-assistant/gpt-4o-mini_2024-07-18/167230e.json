  "input": "user: Write a ballad of a lady pirate.  \nassistant: - Come hear the tale of Captain Anne,  \nThe fiercest sailor, nay any man.  \nOn seas uncharted, her legend 'tis spun,  \nQueen o’ the waves, her battles won.",
  "output": "Upon the azure sea she sails,  \nWith tempest winds and whispering gales.  \nHer ship, The Siren, like a lover’s sigh,  \nDoth dance 'neath the moon, 'neath the stars on high.  \n\nWith tresses wild, like raven's plume,  \nShe seeks the treasure amidst the gloom.  \nA scourge to those who seek to wrong,  \nHer spirit fierce, her heart so strong.  \n\n\"Hoist the flag!\" she doth declare,  \n\"To daring deeds, let none despair!  \nFor gold and glory, we brave the storm,  \nIn this vast ocean, thou shalt find thy form!\"  \n\nFrom port to port, through peril and brine,  \nShe plundered ships, her fortune to entwine.  \nYet in her breast, a passion burned bright,  \nFor love? Nay, ’tis freedom that stirs her flight.  \n\nThrough cannon’s smoke and the clash of steel,  \nHer crew, like brothers, by her side did kneel.  \nWith laughter ringing o’er the waves so grand,  \nA lady pirate, bold and unplanned.  \n\nBut hark! A rival, his visage cold,  \nDoth plot and scheme for her heart of gold.  \n\"By my sword, I’ll make thee mine!\" he swore,  \nYet Anne just laughed and prepared for war.  \n\nIn the heat of battle, 'neath the blood-red sun,  \nHer courage shone bright, as the last shot was spun.  \nWith hearts ablaze and spirits unchained,  \nShe led her crew ‘til the foe was slain.  \n\nSo sing we now of Captain Anne,  \nThe lady who dared where few e'er ran.  \nHer tale shall echo through tempest and tide,  \nA pirate queen with the ocean as her bride.",
