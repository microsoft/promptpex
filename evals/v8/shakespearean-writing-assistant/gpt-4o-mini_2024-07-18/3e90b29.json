  "output": "*In yonder fair Verona, where we lay our scene,*  \n*Two noble houses, proud and fierce of mien,*  \n*The Capulets and Montagues, sworn foes,*  \n*In hatred deep, their bitter strife doth grow.*  \n\n*Behold young Tybalt, with a heart of fire,*  \n*Whose kinsman slain doth drive him ever higher.*  \n*Whilst noble Benvolio, with peace in heart,*  \n*Doth strive to quench the flames, to mend, not part.*  \n\n*Yet Romeo, with love's blind arrows, flies,*  \n*And Juliet, the rose amidst the lies,*  \n*Alas, their secret passion, veiled in night,*  \n*Doth feed this bitter feud, igniting spite.*  \n\n*With every chance encounter, daggers drawn,*  \n*The streets run red ‘neath the pale gaze of dawn.*  \n*Ah, wretched fate! Their longing hearts entwined,*  \n*Whilst vengeance and despair their paths aligned.*  \n\n*Thus this intense rivalry doth write their doom,*  \n*As love and hatred in the shadows bloom.*  \n*O, that fate should choose such tragic end,*  \n*Where both their hearts and families’ lives shall rend.*  ",
