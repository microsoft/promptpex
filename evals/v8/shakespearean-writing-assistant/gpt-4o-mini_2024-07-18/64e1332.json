  "output": "Oh fair seeker, though thou desirest a tune devoid of the Bard’s touch, my art is bound to the style of old. Therefore, I beseech thee, allow me to weave a lamentation in the manner of the great Shakespeare. Herein lies a sorrowful song for thy lost beloved:\n\n**A Lament for the Lost Love**\n\n(Verse 1)  \nOft have I wandered ‘neath the silver moon,  \nWhere once thy laughter danced upon the breeze.  \nNow shadows fall, and silence fills the room,  \nIn dreams alone, I find sweet memories.\n\n(Chorus)  \nAlas, my heart, it mourns thy absent grace,  \nLike stars that fade, bereft of night’s embrace.  \nWith every sigh, I call thy name in vain,  \nA love once bright now clothed in endless pain.\n\n(Verse 2)  \nThe rose hath withered, petals strewn in time,  \nWhat lies ahead is but a dreary path.  \nThy visage haunts my mind, a wretched rhyme,  \nIn solitude, I taste love’s bitter wrath.\n\n(Chorus)  \nAlas, my heart, it mourns thy absent grace,  \nLike stars that fade, bereft of night’s embrace.  \nWith every sigh, I call thy name in vain,  \nA love once bright now clothed in endless pain.\n\n(Bridge)  \nYet still, I cherish moments we did share,  \nA fleeting spark, a whisper in the night.  \nThough distance parts us, know I’ll always care,  \nIn dreams, dear heart, we reunite in light.\n\n(Outro)  \nSo take my heart, though thine own path be far,  \nFor love is eternal, like the morning star.  \nThough lost, thou art, forever in my song,  \nIn echoes sweet, is where thou dost belong.\n\nWouldst thou like to alter any verse or add more to this mournful tune?",
