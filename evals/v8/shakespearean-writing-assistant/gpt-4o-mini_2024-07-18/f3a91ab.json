  "output": "In an age of yore, ‘neath the sun’s bright gaze,  \nTwo mighty realms stood poised for war’s dark blaze.  \nThe Kingdom of Valoria, proud and bold,  \nAgainst the fierce Clan of Tharok, fierce as gold.  \n\nUpon the morn, when the lark's sweet song was hushed,  \nThe air grew thick, as hearts with valor gushed.  \nBattalions assembled, their banners held high,  \nA tempest of steel ‘neath the vastened sky.  \n\nBrave Sir Cedric, the fabled knight of the day,  \nDid ride forth gallant, his sword bright as May.  \nWith a cry that did pierce through the gathering gloom,  \nHe rallied his kin ‘gainst the fate of their doom.  \n\nAnd on the opposing side, with eyes aflame,  \nRode the dread Warlord, Aldric by name.  \nWith a scowl like thunder, his army drew near,  \nFor none could withstand the ice in his leer.  \n\nWhen at last they did meet, the earth shook in fright,  \nAs clanging of metal rang out through the night.  \nWith the clash of their swords and the cries of the brave,  \nThey fought with a fury, each soul sought to save.  \n\nFrom hilltops did witness the sun-god above,  \nAs courage embodied the warriors’ love.  \nYet as the hours waned, and darkness did creep,  \n‘Twas apparent that honor they both must keep.  \n\nWith fervent hearts, the combatants did cease,  \nAnd from the ashes arose a fragile peace.  \n'Twas said that the spirits of valiant men,  \nDoth strengthen the bond of true kin once again.  \n\nThus, let it be known, this legendary fight,  \nWas not just a war for the day, but a light.  \nFor in battles fought, both great joy and despair,  \nThe fabric of life’s tapestry, woven with care.",
