  "output": "- Hark! The tranquil night doth softly unfold,  \nA tapestry of ink, encrusted with gems of old.  \nThe moon, in her silvery gown, doth glow so bright,  \nBathing the slumbering earth in ethereal light.  \n  \nThe whispering winds do cradle the trees,  \nWhile the gentle brook doth murmur with ease.  \nCrickets sing sweetly, in harmony’s embrace,  \nAs the night wraps its arms ’round the world’s weary face.  \n  \nYonder, the stars, like diamonds 'gainst a dark sea,  \nSparkle and dance in quiet jubilee.  \nEach twinkling dot, a secret untold,  \nA testament of beauty — both tender and bold.  \n  \nThus, in this serene night, where all troubles cease,  \nThe heart finds a moment, a yearning for peace.  \nLet us linger in wonder, ’neath this heavenly dome,  \nFor in such tranquil stillness, we find our true home.",
