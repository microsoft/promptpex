  "output": "O, wretched fate that hath befallen thee,  \nThy cobbled streets, once vibrant, now doth flee.  \nThe laughter of children, the marketplace’s throng,  \nNow silence doth reign where once sang a song.  \n\nOnce proud and fair, thy banners did wave,  \nIn the sun's golden light, a city so brave.  \nYet time, that cruel thief, hath stolen away  \nThy beauty and life, now in shadows they lay.  \n\nThe whispers of history in the winds doth sigh,  \nAs memories linger, but wane and die.  \nO Lost City, thy tears, like rivers do flow,  \nIn the heart of the wanderer, eternal thy woe.  \n\nShall we raise up our voices, a solemn refrain,  \nIn mourning for thee, for thy loss is our pain.  \nThus speak we thy name ‘neath the pale, waning moon,  \nO, city of dreams, shall thy spirit return soon?",
