  "output": "In yon fair glade where sunlight doth doth gleam,  \nTwo warriors stand, their eyes ablaze with fire's dream.  \nWith swords unsheathed, and hearts both fierce and proud,  \nThey take their stances, drawing forth a silent crowd.\n\n“Draw forth thy blade, thou caitiff knave!” quoth one,  \n“Prepare thyself; this day a hero shall be won!”  \nWith sinews taut, the clash of metal rings,  \nAs echoes of their strife through time and space still sings.\n\nThey twirl and spin, like tempest winds that blow,  \nA symphony of fury in each parry and thrust, they flow.  \nWith graceful artifice, each cut and slice,  \nA duel unto the death, whose stakes be naught but life.\n\nLo! The sun doth wane, as shadows grow long,  \nYet still the gallant swordsmen tread where they belong.  \nWith fervent heart, each man doth strike anew,  \n'Til one doth falter, and the ground claims his due.\n\nWith a final heave, his foe doth find his mark,  \nThe victor stands tall amidst the fading light, the dark.  \n“Thou art a worthy foe,” he breathes, with respect profound,  \n“For in this dance of death, our honor hath been found.”",
