The two royal siblings, Prince Edric and Princess Isolde, stand before a window, gazing at the tumultuous kingdom beyond.]**\n\n**Isolde:**   \nO, brother dear, what storm dost brew outside?  \nOur people suffer, and war doth threaten nigh.  \nDost thou not feel the weight of our crown,  \nAs shadows of despair engulf our town?\n\n**Edric:**  \nFear not, my sweet sister, for hope yet remains.  \nIn unity, our strength doth break such chains.  \nThough tides may rise and dark clouds form,  \nTogether we shall weather every storm.\n\n**Isolde:**  \nBut if the nobles’ hearts be turned to play,  \nFilthy greed their guiding light each day,  \nHow shall we stand, when trust hath turned to rust?  \nFor faith hath faltered, and in thee I must trust.\n\n**Edric:**  \nThen let us rally, ignite the spark of pride,  \nTo bend the will of those who seek to bide.  \nFor loyalty, true kinship, cannot wane,  \nIf we inspire, all hearts shall entertain.\n\n**Isolde:**  \nThen what shall be our plan, O noble prince?  \nShall we call forth the loyal, let them commence?  \nTo speak of hope upon this battleground,  \nAnd raise our banner high, till peace be found?\n\n**Edric:**  \nAye, let it be so! A summons shall be sent,  \nTo every loyal heart, let our voices blend!  \nFor in each struggle, our bond shall be shown,  \nTogether we shall stand, as one, not alone. \n\n**Isolde:**  \nThen let us muster courage, for the day is near,  \nAnd with our people’s strength, we shall persevere.  \nO, brother, lead me forth; I shall follow thee,  \nTo forge anew our rightful destiny.  \n\n**[They clasp hands, their resolve strengthened, as the light of dawn begins to break through the darkened sky.]**",
