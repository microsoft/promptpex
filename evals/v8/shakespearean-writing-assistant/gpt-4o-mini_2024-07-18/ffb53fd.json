  "output": "Upon a time, when evening’s breath did sigh,  \nI spied a maid, whose beauty caught mine eye.  \nHer visage bright as stars that grace the night,  \nYet in my heart, she knew not of my plight.  \n\nO cruel fate! That love should bloom in vain,  \nFor like the rose, it blossoms, yet brings pain.  \nI sing her praises in the darkened night,  \nWhilst she, oblivious, doth bask in light.  \n\nThine eyes, like twin lakes shimmering in June,  \nReflect not love, but gently mar the tune.  \nI pen sweet sonnets that shall ne’er be read,  \nFor ‘tis but folly, love that’s left for dead.  \n\nThough every glance doth pierce my soul anew,  \nAnd every smile doth weave a fabric blue,  \nI wear my heart as armor, torn and frail,  \nA silent bard whose melodies shall pale.  \n\nThus, in this tale of love that cannot be,  \nI find my solace in my woeful plea.  \nO time, unkind! Restore my shattered dreams,  \nFor her sweet laughter haunts my tender screams.  ",
