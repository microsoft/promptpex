  "output": "In fair Verona's bustling streets, where merry souls doth gather, a lunch meeting amongst friends unfolds in joyous revelry. Hark! The sun doth cast its golden rays upon a humble tavern, where the air is rich with the aroma of savory feasts.\n\nAround a table laden with delicacies, our merry band dost assemble: sweet laughter echoes in the air as jests and jibes are exchanged like precious gems. Good wine doth flow, and the clinking of goblets rings forth as they toast to friendships anew and old.\n\nOne friend, spirited and keen, doth regale the company with tales of yore, whilst another, jesting with a glimmer in his eye, doth share scandalous whispers of love and folly. The bread is broken, and the meat is shared, as hearts and spirits intertwine in harmonious discourse.\n\nAs the midday sun doth wane, they savor the sweet moments, knowing that such gatherings, like the fleeting hours of summer, bring warmth to the soul. In merriment and mirth, they partake, pledging to meet again ere long, for true friendship doth bloom eternal, nourished by the laughter and love that doth bind them.",
