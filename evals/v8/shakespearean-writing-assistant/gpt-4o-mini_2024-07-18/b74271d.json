  "output": "Upon yonder hill, where darkened clouds convene,  \nStands the haunted castle, veiled in foreboding scene.  \nIts stone walls, weathered by time's cruel embrace,  \nHold tales of despair, love lost, and grim fate's chase.  \n  \nThe winds do moan, a mournful dirge resound,  \nE'er creeping through the corridors, profound.  \nThe flick'ring torches cast phantoms that dance,  \nIn the gloaming's grasp, where shadows enhance.  \n  \nA chill doth creep, like ghostly fingers 'pon the skin,  \nAs footfalls echo of those who once did in.  \nThe air be thick with tales of woe and fright,  \nIn this somber abode, where day dost meet the night.  \n  \nPerchance a specter wanders, lost in despair,  \nWith hollow gaze that pierceth the thickening air.  \nBeware, dear traveller, for within these walls doth dwell  \nA truth most haunting, too dark to quell.
