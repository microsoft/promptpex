  "output": "Ah, fair friend, I shall endeavor to craft an elegy that doth echo with sorrowful grace. Here is a lament for one departed:\n\nO Muse, in grief I call upon thy light,  \nTo weave a tapestry of tender woe;  \nFor one whose spirit shone both pure and bright,  \nNow lies enshrined beneath the silent snow.\n\nWhat sorrow hath the fates conspired to weave,  \nThat snatched from us thy laughter and thy mirth?  \nIn every shadow, I perceive thy leave,  \nFor thou art gone, yet lingerest on earth.\n\nThe gentle breeze doth whisper of thy name,  \nAnd every flower now weeps for thy loss.  \nIn memoryâ€™s garden, thou shalt bear no shame,  \nThough death hath claimed thee, love cannot be tossed.\n\nFarewell, sweet friend, may angels guard thy rest,  \nIn realms where pain and sorrow know no tune.  \nThy essence lives, forever thou art blessed,  \nUntil we meet again beneath the moon.  \n\nThus, in this verse, I mourn what once was dear,  \nIn hopes that peace dost cradle thee up high.  \nThy memory, a lantern, ever near,  \nIn every tear, thy spirit shall not die.",
