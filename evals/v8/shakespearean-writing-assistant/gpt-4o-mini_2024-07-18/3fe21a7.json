  "output": "**[A Dramatic Quarrel Between Two Friends]**\n\n**Friend One:**  \nO thou wretched knave! Dost thou take me for a fool?  \nThy treachery hath pierced mine heart like poison'd dart.  \nDidst thou think me blind to thine unkind acts?  \n\n**Friend Two:**  \nNay, thou dost twist the truth ’neath shadows dark!  \n'Twas not my hand that wrought this blight upon us;  \nIt is thee who art blinded by thy haughty pride!  \n\n**Friend One:**  \nPride? By my troth, it is loyalty that I seek!  \nHast thou forgotten the vows that once we swore?  \nOur bond was forged in flames, now reduced to ash!  \n\n**Friend Two:**  \nWhat folly is this, to cling to words long past?  \nThe world hath changed, and so too must we bend.  \nArt thou so foolish as to dwell on memories?  \n\n**Friend One:**  \nFoolish, mayhap, but ne'er will I forgive!  \nThy betrayal stings worse than a viper's bite.  \nI had deemed thee faithful, yet thee hath turn'd thine eye!  \n\n**Friend Two:**  \nAnd thou art a leech, sapping joy from my heart!  \nI sought to soar on wings of new accord;  \nYet, here thou stand’st, chain'd to ire and disdain!  \n\n**Friend One:**  \nChains, thou dost speak? It is thou who art bound!  \nBound by thy greed, thy vanity, thy derision!  \nI had thought thee a brother, but now I know thee false!  \n\n**Friend Two:**  \nMayhap ‘tis better we part and live apart,  \nFor in thy venom I find no friendship left.  \nThus I cast aside this burdensome weight!  \n\n**Friend One:**  \nThen let us sever the thread of our kinship,  \nAnd may the winds of fate guide us far asunder.  \nFarewell, traitor! Speak not my name again!  \n\n**Friend Two:**  \nFare thee well, once dear friend, now foe accursed!  \nWith heavy heart, I turn from this darkened fate.  \nMayhap in yonder future, peace we may reclaim.
