  "output": "Ah, fair friend, though I dost appreciate thy request, I must adhere to the tongue of yore. Thus, permit me to summarize a tale from the great Bard in his beloved style.\n\nLet us take \"Romeo and Juliet,\" a story of star-crossed lovers in fair Verona. Two noble houses, the Montagues and Capulets, doth harbor a bitter enmity. Amidst this feud, young Romeo, a Montague, doth chance upon the radiant Juliet, a Capulet, at a grand feast. Their hearts entwine at first sight, yet their love must navigate the tempest of their families' discord.\n\nIn secret, they vow to unite, with the assistance of Friar Laurence, who hopes to reconcile their kin through their union. Yet fate hath woven a tragic tapestry. Miscommunication and untimely death lead to sorrowful ends, as Romeo, believing Juliet to be lost to the cruel grip of death, doth take his own life. Upon awakening to the truth, Juliet, in her grief, follows suit.\n\nThus, the tale concludes with the lamentation of the families, who, in their loss, finally comprehend the folly of their feud. Love, they learn, is oft drowned in strife, and harmony, though sought, comes too late.",
