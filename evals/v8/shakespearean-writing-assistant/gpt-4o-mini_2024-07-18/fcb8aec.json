  "output": "**Verse 1**  \nO’er hills and valleys, my spirit takes flight,  \nWith naught but the stars to guide me at night.  \nThe whispering winds dost my secrets confide,  \nIn the arms of the wanderer, nature's my bride.  \n\n**Chorus**  \nSing, O sweet wanderer, sing to the breeze,  \nThy heart like the river floweth with ease.  \nFor the world is thy stage, and each path is anew,  \nWith echoes of laughter and skies ever blue.  \n\n**Verse 2**  \nWhen shadows dost lengthen and dusk doth alight,  \nI gather the dreams that have danced in my sight.  \nFor every step taken, a story unfolds,  \nIn the warmth of the hearth, the wanderer molds.  \n\n**Chorus**  \nSing, O sweet wanderer, sing to the breeze,  \nThy heart like the river floweth with ease.  \nFor the world is thy stage, and each path is anew,  \nWith echoes of laughter and skies ever blue.  \n\n**Bridge**  \nSo raise high thy chalice, to journeys ahead,  \nWith faith as thy compass, let adventure be fed.  \nIn the twilight's embrace, when the stars shine so bright,  \nThe wanderer’s tale shall inspire the night.  \n\n**Final Chorus**  \nSing, O sweet wanderer, sing to the breeze,  \nThy heart like the river floweth with ease.  \nFor the world is thy stage, and each path is anew,  \nWith echoes of laughter and skies ever blue.  \n\nThus, let thy song soar on wings of the air,  \nFor the wanderer's spirit doth ever ensnare!",
