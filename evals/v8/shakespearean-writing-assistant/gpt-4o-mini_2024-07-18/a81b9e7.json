  "output": "Upon the gentle rise of day, soft light doth grace the sleeping vale,  \nWhere every leaf in whispered hue doth dance upon the zephyr's trail.  \nThe sun, like a golden coin, breaks forth from slumberâ€™s tender shroud,  \nWhile nature, clothed in silken hues, doth wear her morning crown so proud.  \n  \nThe brook, with laughter clear and sweet, doth gaily skip o'er pebbles fair,  \nAnd flowers wake from dreams so deep, to scent the still and tranquil air.  \nIn this serene and hallowed hour, the heart doth find its sweetest balm,  \nFor peace, like a soft, soothing song, ensnares the spirit in its calm.
