  "output": "- Mark the scene as nature dons her cloaks of fire,  \nThe trees, like sentinels, bow to the desire  \nOf gentle breezes that through branches weave,  \nAs they scent the air with the tales of leaves.  \n\nThe harvest moon doth rise, round and bright,  \nCasting silver beams upon the coming night.  \nThe cornfields bow low, their bounty laid bare,  \nWhilst whispers of dusk linger soft in the air.  \n\nOft the shy sun doth bid adieu to the day,  \nIn hues of crimson and orange display.  \nNature's canvas painted with splendor so rich,  \nIn the heart of autumn, where beauty doth twitch.",
