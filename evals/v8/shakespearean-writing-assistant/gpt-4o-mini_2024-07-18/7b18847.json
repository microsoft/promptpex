Hark! O spirits, lend us thine ear,  \nIn this enchanted hour, draw ever near.  \nWith fire and earth, with water and air,  \nWe seek thy presence, we seek thy care.  \n\n- Where'er thou art, 'neath darkened skies,  \nCome forth, arise, 'fore our very eyes.  \nBy the light of the moon, by the stars above,  \nWe bind this spell with the force of love.",
