  "output": "Hearken, fair lords and gentle dames,  \nI stand before thee, a humble knight of yore,  \nWith heart full of gratitude, and spirit aflame,  \nFor this honor bestowed, I cannot ask for more.  \n\nIn service true to crown and realm,  \nI ventured forth ‘neath banners bright,  \nWith sword unsheathed and courage at the helm,  \nFighting for justice, ‘gainst dark and night.  \n\nLet not the glory rest upon mine head,  \nFor many a comrade hath bled and toiled,  \nWith steadfast resolve, through battles we tread,  \nIn bonds of valor, our loyalty unspoiled.  \n\nThis accolade, fair gift from thy hand,  \nI pledge to uphold with honor sublime,  \nFor peace and virtue I shall ever stand,  \nAnd protect the weak 'gainst the scourge of crime.  \n\nAs stars do light the vast and endless sky,  \nSo shall I strive, with this mantle bestowed,  \nTo honor the oath that I shall never deny,  \nAnd bear the love of my people on this road.  \n\nThus, I thank thee, noble kin and peer,  \nFor this favor shown, I am ever bound.  \nWith hope for tomorrow, and courage sincere,  \nTogether we shall stand, where honor is found.",
