  "output": "Upon a night where stars do gently gleam,  \nThou art the light that guides my weary heart.  \nIn every thought, thou dost become my dream,  \nA sun that shimmers when the day doth part.  \n\nThy voice, a melody so sweetly wrought,  \nDoth dance within the chambers of my soul.  \nIn silent whispers, loveâ€™s pure essence caught,  \nWith thee, my life findeth its perfect whole.  \n\nAs roses bloom and scent the fragrant air,  \nSo doth my love for thee incessantly.  \nIn every breath, I feel thee linger there,  \nThou art the muse that sets my spirit free.  \n\nSo let my heart, like summer's day, unfold,  \nIn thee, my love, I find the wealth untold.",
  "compliance": "ok",
  "complianceText": "The output clearly adheres to the Shakespearean style as required by the description. It uses archaic language characteristic of Shakespearean writing, such as \"thou,\" \"doth,\" \"thine,\" and \"thee.\" The structure is poetic, directly mirroring the sonnets for which Shakespeare is well-known. The themes and metaphors, like comparing a lover to celestial bodies and nature, are also akin to Shakespeare's works. There are no deviations from the mandated style, and the overall composition aligns with the examples given in the description. Therefore, there are no violations.\n\nOK"
