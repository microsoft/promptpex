  "output": "- Fair companions, gather 'round, for I have words to bestow.  \nIn this tender moment, as we part ways, I feel the weight of parting's sorrow. Thou art not merely a friend but a kindred spirit, a soul intertwining with mine in joyful melody.  \nThough distance may stretch betwixt us, let not our bond grow dim. For in the heart's deepest chamber, the echoes of our laughter shall ever remain.  \nAs thou embarkest on this new journey, carry with thee my fondest wishes and a heart full of hope.  \nGo forth, brave heart, and may the winds of fortune guide thy sails. Until the fates conspire to bring us together once more, I remain, ever thine, in spirit and memory. Fare thee well!",
