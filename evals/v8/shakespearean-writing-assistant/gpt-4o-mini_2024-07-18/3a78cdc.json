  "output": "In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,  \nOnce dwelt a prince, noble of heart, yet seamed  \nWith sorrow deep, for love had turned him pale,  \nHis spirit dimmed by fate’s most cruel gale.  \n\nPrince Alaric, of eyes as azure skies,  \nWith golden tresses that danced 'neath soft sighs,  \nHad fallen for a maiden, pure and bright,  \nLady Isolde, whose beauty stole the night.  \n\nBut alas! Their love, like a fleeting ghost,  \nWas doomed by a bond that the heavens chose;  \nFor she was wed to a lord of fine skill,  \nA rival strong, whose heart was wrought of steel.  \n\nEach eve, in secret, Alaric would wander,  \nBeneath the moon’s soft gaze, he’d sit and ponder,  \nWith heart so heavy, and thoughts like the breeze,  \nHe’d whisper sweet nothings to rustling leaves.  \n\n“O cruel fate! Why dost thou mock mine heart?  \nWhy place her visage, then bid us depart?  \nEach glance, each smile, doth pierce mine very soul,  \nYet like the waves, our destinies roll.”  \n\nThus, in his chamber, he penned her a letter,  \n\"Dear Isolde, thou art my heart’s sole debtor.  \nThough shadows may gather ‘twixt thee and I,  \nIn dreams, my sweet love, together we fly.\"  \n\nYet fate, most unkind, dost not heed his plea,  \nAs the lark sings to the unwaking bee.  \nFor the morn shall break, and the sun shall rise,  \nWhile he remains captive to lingering sighs.  \n\nYet Prince Alaric, though forlorn and pale,  \nLearns that love’s power may weave a new tale.  \nFor in his despair, he vows to be free,  \nTo seek out the light and let love's spirit be.  \n\nThus, he trod on the path of the brave,  \nWith hope in his heart that true love might save.  \nAnd so, with resolve and undying grace,  \nHe shall find his fortune, ‘neath love’s warm embrace.",
