  "output": "Oh, gather 'round, ye stars of heaven's dome,  \nWhere e’er the silvered moon doth softly gleam,  \nIn resplendent circle, while the cosmos roam,  \nA congregation of celestial dream.  \n\nAttend, ye mighty spheres, in regal attire,  \nThe radiant sun, with golden hues most bright,  \nHis countenance dost light the evening squire,  \nWhilst twinkling orbs in harmony take flight.  \n\nWhat solemn discourses dost thou exchange,  \nIn whispers borne on winds of ethereal might?  \nOft ponder’st thou the fate of realms so strange,  \nWhen mortal hearts, with hope, behold thy light?  \n\nWith dignity and grace, thy gathering grand,  \nThe firmament, a stage where dreams ascend,  \nUnited in the cosmic dance, hand in hand,  \nThou weave a tapestry that hath no end.  \n\nSo let us raise our eyes to yonder sky,  \nFor in this celestial conclave we dost find,  \nEternity’s embrace, where time can ne'er die,  \nAnd all creation sings in love entwined.",
