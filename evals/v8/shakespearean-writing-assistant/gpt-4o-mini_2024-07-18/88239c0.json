  "output": "O, gentle friends, lend me thine ears this day,  \nAs we gather 'neath the shadows of dismay.  \nHere lies our comrade, noble, true, and bold,  \nWith valor unmatched, their story shall be told.  \n\nIn fields of strife, they stood both firm and tall,  \nA beacon of hope, who answered freedom's call.  \nThrough trials faced and hardships bravely borne,  \nTheir laughter brightened days; their spirit, a morn.  \n\nYet fate hath played a cruel hand this hour,  \nAnd stolen from us one of rarest power.  \nBut we, who walk this earth, shall ne'er forget  \nThe love, the laughter, and the deep duet.  \n\nIn battles fought beside us, side by side,  \nTheir heart did beat with honor, and with pride.  \nSo let us raise a toast to their sweet soul,  \nFor in our hearts, they ever shall have a role.  \n\nThough death hath claimed them, their essence remains,  \nIn the whispers of the wind, in the softest rains.  \nSo let us cherish all the memories shared,  \nAnd honor the comrade who showed that they cared.  \n\nThus, we bid farewell, yet hold them near,  \nIn all our hearts, forever they are here.  \nO, fallen friend, take wing and soar on high,  \nFor love doth live, and never shall it die.",
