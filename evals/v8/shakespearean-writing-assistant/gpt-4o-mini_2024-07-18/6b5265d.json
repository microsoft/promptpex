  "output": "In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,  \nA maiden named Elenora, bright and keen,  \nWith spirit bold and heart so brave,  \nAgainst the tide of fate she sought to pave.  \n\nHer father, a lord of mighty renown,  \nDid oft in shadows wear a troubled frown.  \nForsooth, a villain, dark as night,  \nDid seek to steal the treasures of their right.  \n\nNow Elenora, with courage unsurpassed,  \nResolved to fight this evil, fierce and fast.  \nWith sword in hand and heart afire,  \nShe vowed to thwart the foe and never tire.  \n\nAt dawn's first light, she donned her armor bright,  \nPrepared to clash, and face the wicked knight.  \n“Thou shalt not take what rightfully is ours!”  \nShe cried unto the heavens, 'neath the stars.  \n\nThrough forest deep and over hill so steep,  \nShe journeyed forth, her resolve to keep.  \nThe whispers of the winds did chant her name,  \nFor all who knew her spoke with awe of fame.  \n\nAt last she came upon the fiend so vile,  \nHis countenance a mask of pure denial.  \n“Thou think'st thyself victorious and strong,  \nBut wrong art thou; I shall avenge the wrong.”  \n\nA battle fierce ensued, the clash of steel,  \nAs courage burned within her like a wheel.  \nWith every thrust and parry deftly made,  \nElenora fought, her fear allayed.  \n\nAt length, with cunning strike and strength of heart,  \nShe laid upon the ground the villain’s part.  \n“Now go, begone, and trouble us no more!  \nFor courage dwells within this heart, I swore.”  \n\nThus, Verona hailed Elenora’s name,  \nA beacon of hope, a light that flickered flame.  \nFor in her valiant quest, the world did see,  \nA courageous young woman, bold and free.  \n\nSo let us raise a toast to those who stand,  \nWith courage as their shield, and heart so grand.  \nFor within every soul, a warrior lies,  \nAnd in the darkest hours, their spirit flies.",
