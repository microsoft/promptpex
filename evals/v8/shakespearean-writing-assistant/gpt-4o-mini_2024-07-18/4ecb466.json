  "output": "Upon a time when trust did brightly shine,  \nAnd hearts entwined in bonds of purest grace,  \nA serpent’s glance did mark the love divine,  \nWith whispered lies, it placed a fell disgrace.  \n\nThou swore upon the stars, thy heart was true,  \nYet shadows crept where sunlight once did play,  \nIn silence deep, thy treachery did strew,  \nAnd turned my joy to sorrow’s dark array.  \n\nOh, how the bitter pangs of love do wound,  \nWhen sweetest words do turn to hollow air;  \nA friendship’s root now severed and unsound,  \nAs trust, once firm, lies shattered and laid bare.  \n\nSo let this heart, though bruised, arise anew,  \nFor loyalty, like dawn, shall break the blue.",
