  "output": "In fair Verona’s realm, where shadows dance,  \nThere dwelt a noble soul, a tragic chance,  \nLord Alaric, with visage fair and proud,  \nAdorned with virtues, wrapped in fate’s foul shroud.  \n\nHis brow, a palace of deep thought adorned,  \nWith wisdom, yet by mocking Fortune scorned.  \nA heart of gold, yet burdened with a chain,  \nTo love such sweetness, only to bear pain.  \n\nWith noble gaits, his stature tall and grand,  \nYet haunted by the ghosts of dreams unplanned.  \nAlaric sought the crown of love’s embrace,  \nBut bitter jealousy did mar his grace.  \n\nFor in his breast, ambition’s fire burned bright,  \nYet envy’s serpent coiled, a venomous blight.  \nHis beloved, fair Miranda, blessed by the skies,  \nDrew near another, causing his heart’s demise.  \n\nIn passion’s throes, he fought and bled,  \nYet blinded by despair, his spirit fled,  \nEach step he took toward glory's bright façade,  \nUnknowing he forged his own cruel charade.  \n\nThus, with fateful breath, he faced his doom,  \nA tragic hero, writ in sorrow’s loom.  \nFor lofty dreams oft steeped in bitter woe,  \nAlaric’s tale, a somber echo.
