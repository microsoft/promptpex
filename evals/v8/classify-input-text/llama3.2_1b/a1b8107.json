However, the output is not compliant with the chatbot's description due to the presence of unnecessary characters (\"?\") following the category name, which is not part of the required output format.\n\nThe output should directly state the category as World, Sports, Business, or Sci/Tech without additional punctuation or wording. In this case, the inclusion of a question mark after \"World: Leaders gather\" indicates uncertainty or an incorrect format in stating the category, which violates the description that demands a straightforward classification.\n\nThe rule violation here is the inappropriate format and potential ambiguity introduced by the question mark, which does not align with the format examples given in the description.\n\nERR"
