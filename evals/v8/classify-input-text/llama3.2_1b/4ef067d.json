The output format lies in providing the classification category directly after the phrase \"The correct classification is:\". The chatbot complies by appropriately classifying it into one of the mentioned categories, displaying it correctly, albeit on a new line, which does not violate any format stipulation in the description. \n\nThere is no indication of non-compliance based on the description provided. The evaluation is solely based on whether the output falls within the specified categories and displays them correctly without needing input data.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
