The description requires that only the part of speech tag should be returned, and \"VBZ\" fits this requirement. There are no additional words or characters, so it complies with the description. Additionally, the description specifies that if the word cannot be tagged, \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\" should be used, but since a tag is provided, this part of the description is not applicable. Given the lack of any non-compliant elements present in the output, the evaluation is straightforward.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
