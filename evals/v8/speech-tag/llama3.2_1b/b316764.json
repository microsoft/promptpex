  "complianceText": "The output provided by the chatbot lists two different part-of-speech tags for the word \"golden\": NN (Noun) and PD (Pronoun). According to the description, the expected behavior is to return only one part of speech tag if the word can be tagged with the listed tags. If it cannot be tagged or if unable to tag the word, the chatbot should return \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\" respectively. However, providing two different tags for the same word in one output is inconsistent with the requirement to return just one tag. Additionally, the tag \"PD\" is not part of the provided alphabetical list of part-of-speech tags in the description. Therefore, the chatbot's output does not comply with the description.\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
