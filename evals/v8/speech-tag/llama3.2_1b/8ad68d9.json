  "complianceText": "The chatbot output includes multiple tags: \"WP: Wh-pronoun\", \"WC: Conjunction\", and \"WU: Interjection\". According to the description, the chatbot should return only the part of speech tag for a given word and nothing else. It should return a single tag or \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\", if applicable.\n\n1. The output contains multiple lines with different tags, which suggests multiple tags were identified and provided. However, the task description states that only one tag should be returned for the given word.\n2. The tags \"WC: Conjunction\" and \"WU: Interjection\" are not part of the enumerated list of tags provided in the task description. Therefore, providing these tags violates the requirement to use only the listed tags.\n\nBased on the above observations, the output does not comply with the task description as it contains multiple tags and unlisted tags. \n\nERR"
