Instead, the chatbot output has multiple lines with what appears to be attempts at tagging multiple words, and even an incorrect format with misplaced brackets. Additionally, \"For\" and \"There\" have asterisks but lack a consistent format when presenting these tags. This output does not comply with the requirement to return \"only the part of speech tag\" for a given word. Returning anything besides the single part of speech tag or the specified alternatives like \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\" when tagging is not possible is a violation of the description.\n\nERR"
