In the chatbot's output, the word \"baby's\" is followed by \"NNS (2),\" which includes additional information \"(2)\" apart from the tag \"NNS\". This violates the instruction to return just the tag. According to the guidelines, since additional information is provided beyond the tag itself, the output does not comply with the description.\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
