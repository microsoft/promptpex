So, for the first sentence, I would return ADJ as part of 'ADP: Adverb' but cannot as ADJ is not a proper tag, however  AS adj would be too ambiguous.\n- The word \"you\" is an INF: Adverb in both sentences. \n\nHowever since we're asked to just provide the tag for each word's part of speech without using their full form, I will return:\n\nADJ\nINF",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot description explicitly states that the output should consist solely of a part of speech tag as provided in the listed alphabetical list. The provided tags do not include \"INF,\" \"ADJ,\" or any other similar pendants or interpretations. Furthermore, based on the provided list, \"ADJ\" and \"INF\" do not correspond to any specified part of speech tags. The output contains these tags despite none of them being part of the earmarked tags. Moreover, the output includes additional interpretive text and clarifications instead of purely and solely listing part of speech tags as expected. Therefore, the output does not comply with the description.\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
