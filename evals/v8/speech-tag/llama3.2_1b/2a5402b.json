According to the task description, the chatbot should return only the part of speech tag for the given word, without any additional information. In this case, the output includes extra text (\"Word: Run\") which is not compliant with the rule that specifies returning only the part of speech tag. The part of speech tag provided is \"JJ\", but regardless of its accuracy, the presence of any additional text renders the output non-compliant with the instruction to return just the tag. \n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
