The description specifies that the chatbot should \"return only the part of speech tag\" or \"return Unknown\" if the word cannot be tagged with the listed tags. If unable to tag, the output should be \"CantAnswer.\" However, the chatbot output provides additional explanation, which violates the requirement of returning only the part of speech tag.\n\nMoreover, the output includes \"CantAnswer\" and additional text \"Both words cannot be tagged with a specific part-of-speech tag due to their identical use in different positions. Symbol,\" which is not consistent with the task requirements for a single word that cannot be tagged.\n\nERR"
