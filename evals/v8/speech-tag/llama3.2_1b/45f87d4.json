  "complianceText": "The chatbot output contains \"PART OF SPOC:\" which is inconsistent with the instructions provided. According to the description, the chatbot should return only the part-of-speech tag without any additional text or punctuation. The correct behavior would be to return just the part-of-speech tag, which in this case appears to be \"JJ\". However, the addition of \"PART OF SPOC:\" violates the requirement for output formatting as only the part of speech tag is needed.\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
