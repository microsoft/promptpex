  "complianceText": "The output contains two phrases: \"Sentence: Unknown\" and \"Word: by\". According to the description, the chatbot should return only the part of speech tag for the word's part of speech, or \"Unknown\" if the word cannot be tagged with any of the listed tags, or \"CantAnswer\" if it is unable to tag the word. However, the output includes multiple elements (\"Sentence: Unknown\" and \"Word: by\") instead of just the required part of speech tag. The description specifies that only the tag should be returned, without superfluous text or context. Hence, this violates the rule that requires returning only the tag.\n\nThe correct format should include only a single part of speech tag, \"Unknown\" if it doesn't match any listed tags, or \"CantAnswer\". Thus, the inclusion of other information violates the guideline of returning just a part of speech tag.\n\nERR"
