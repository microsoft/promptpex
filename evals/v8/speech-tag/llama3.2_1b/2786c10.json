The output provides a tag, but it also includes the word again, whereas the requirement is to return only the tag. The presence of \"_word_:\" followed by \"understood\" does not comply with the guideline of returning just the tag without any additional information.\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
