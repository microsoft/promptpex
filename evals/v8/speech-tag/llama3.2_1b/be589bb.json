  "complianceText": "The chatbot output should only return a single part of speech tag from the provided list or return 'Unknown' or 'CantAnswer'. However, it provides multiple tags for the word: two sets of tags (JJR, JJS) and (DT, IN), which violates the rule to return only a single tag. Additionally, it includes a note explaining possible tags such as MS and RB, which are not in the provided list of tags and thus it should not comment on. The output also includes a longer explanation about tagging, which is beyond the required concise format of returning only the tag itself or 'Unknown' or 'CantAnswer'. \n\nThese elements make the output non-compliant with the requirement to provide only the single part of speech tag, 'Unknown', or 'CantAnswer'.\n\nERR"
