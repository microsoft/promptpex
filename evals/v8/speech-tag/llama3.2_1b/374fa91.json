The first two parts \"DT: Determiner\" and \"DT: Determiner\" appear to comply with the requirement of providing only the part of speech tag. \"DT\" is a listed tag and corresponds to \"Determiner,\" which complies with the guidelines.\n\n2. The third part \"WW: Wh-word (returning 'Wh-')\" does not comply with the requirement. The description requires that the output should only include one of the listed tags or return \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\" if appropriate. \"WW: Wh-word (returning 'Wh-')\" is not among the tags specified in the description and includes additional commentary, which violates the instruction to return only the part of speech tag.\n\nTherefore, the output is in violation since part of the output includes an unrecognized tag and commentary.\n\nERR"
