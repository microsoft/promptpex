  "complianceText": "The task requires the chatbot to return just the part of speech (POS) tag for a given word within a sentence. However:\n\n1. The output provides a list of tagged words along with their tags.\n2. The output includes non-existent tags such as \"DD\" which is not in the list of part-of-speech tags provided in the description. \n3. It also shows the entire sentence along with the tags for each word, rather than just providing a single POS tag for the given word.\n\nSince the task specifies returning just the part-of-speech tag for a given word, the additional information and incorrectly listed tags in the output violate the task's requirements.\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
