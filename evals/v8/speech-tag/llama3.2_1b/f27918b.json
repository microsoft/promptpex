  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output provides a tag \"RC (Relational, no grammatical function)\" for the word \"is,\" which is not among the listed part-of-speech tags provided in the description. Therefore, this part of the output does not comply with the description requirement to only use the specified tags. \n\nThe second instance tags the word \"is\" as \"CC (Coordinating conjunction),\" which is a valid tag according to the list provided in the description. However, since the same word is tagged differently in two instances, it indicates inconsistency, which cannot be addressed without knowing the correct context from the input. Nonetheless, the first tag itself is non-compliant due to using an invalid tag.\n\nErroneous use of a non-listed tag led to the determination of non-compliance. \n\nERR"
