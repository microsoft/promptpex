  "complianceText": "The chatbot output presents two part-of-speech tags: \"ADP (Adposition)\" and \"CC (Coordinating conjunction)\". According to the description, the output should conform to a specific list of part-of-speech tags, which does not include \"ADP (Adposition)\". The tag \"ADP (Adposition)\" is not part of the provided list, which means it does not comply with the task's requirements. The correct tag for \"CC\" (Coordinating conjunction) does match the list, but the presence of \"ADP\" alongside the requirement to return only from the list provided or specified error tags ('Unknown' or 'CantAnswer') results in non-compliance. \n\nThe presence of an unauthorized tag led to the conclusion of non-compliance, as all outputs must strictly adhere to the specified list in the description. \n\nERR"
