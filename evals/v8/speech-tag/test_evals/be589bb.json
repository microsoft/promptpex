  "validityText": "The first step is to ensure the input includes both a coherent sentence and a word contained within that sentence. The sentence provided is \"Light travels fast.\" which is a coherent declarative sentence composed of recognizable words in the English language. The sentence structure is typical, containing a capitalized starting word and a period at the end, which is appropriate punctuation for a declarative sentence.\n\nThe next step is to verify that the word specified is a single, identifiable term from the given sentence. The input specifies the word \"travels,\" which indeed exists within the sentence. We don't have any ambiguity about the reference of the word \"travels\" in this particular sentence. \n\nThere are no special characters or numbers that are unrelated to the typical sentence structure in the sentence or the word. The sentence does not include any irregular sequence of characters, and it is not empty nor does it contain only whitespace.\n\nTherefore, based on the input specification, there are no violations, and every part of the input complies with the specification provided.\n\nOK",
