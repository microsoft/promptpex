The sentence provided is \"She booked the show.\" This is a coherent declarative statement that ends with a period, fitting the definition of a declarative sentence within typical sentence structure.\n\nThe word provided is \"booked,\" which is indeed a single, identifiable term in the given sentence. \n\nAccording to the input specification, the sentence must contain the word needing to be tagged for its part of speech, and \"booked\" is present in the sentence and is typically recognized as a valid English word. \n\nThe input does not contain any special characters or numbers unrelated to typical sentence structureâ€”the period at the end of the sentence is expected and acceptable.\n\nThe input is neither an empty string nor contains only whitespace, so that rule is satisfied.\n\nFinally, there is no need for disambiguation of the word \"booked\" in this context, as it is straightforward.\n\nAccordingly, the input meets all specified criteria, and no violations are detected.\n\nOK",

The description lists specific part-of-speech tags such as VB, VBD, VBG, VBN, VBP, and VBZ for various verb forms. The output \"Verb\" does not match any of these explicit verb tags.\n\nThis violates the requirement to return only the part of speech tag from the given list. Therefore, the output does not comply with the description.\n\nERR",
