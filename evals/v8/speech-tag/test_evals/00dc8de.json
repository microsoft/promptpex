  "coverageEvalText": "The output \"noun\" does not comply with the chatbot description. The chatbot is expected to return a specific part-of-speech tag from the provided list, such as \"NN\" for a singular noun or \"NNS\" for a plural noun. Since \"noun\" is not one of these tags, but rather a general term, it does not follow the requirement to \"return just the tag for the word's part of speech.\" Thus, the output violates the guideline that the tag must be one of the specified POS tags or specific responses like \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer.\"\n\nERR",
