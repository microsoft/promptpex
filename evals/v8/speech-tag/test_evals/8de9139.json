  "coverageText": "VB",
  "validityText": "The input consists of a sentence, \"It shines brightly.\" and a word, \"shines\". Let's evaluate its compliance based on the input specification:\n\n1. **Sentence Structure**: The sentence \"It shines brightly.\" is a coherent sequence of words forming a declarative statement. It appears to be grammatically correct and complete.\n\n2. **Word Presence in Sentence**: The word \"shines\" is present in the sentence \"It shines brightly.\", satisfying the requirement that the sentence must contain the word.\n\n3. **Special Characters or Numbers**: The only punctuation present is the period at the end of the sentence, which is typical for sentence structure. There are no special characters or numbers unrelated to the sentence structure.\n\n4. **Non-empty Input**: The input is not an empty string nor does it contain only whitespace.\n\n5. **Validity of Word**: The word \"shines\" is a valid word in English and is not a random sequence of characters. \n\n6. **Disambiguation**: The word \"shines\" does not require disambiguation within the context of the sentence provided; its usage as a verb in this context is clear.\n\nBased on the evaluation against each specification guideline, there are no violations, and all parts of the specification are satisfied. Therefore, the input meets the requirements.\n\nOK",

  "coverageEvalText": "The chatbot output is \"VB\". To evaluate compliance, I need to check if this output is just the part of speech tag. The description specifies that the output should be the tag representing the part of speech of a word from the list provided or \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\" if applicable. \"VB\" is indeed one of the tags listed in the description (Verb, base form). Since the output is a valid tag from the list and follows the instruction to return just the tag, it complies with the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",
