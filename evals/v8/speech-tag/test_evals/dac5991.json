  "validityText": "The input consists of a sentence \"He will write a letter.\" and a word \"write\" that is intended to be identified in that sentence. I will evaluate this based on the input specification provided.\n\n1. **Sentence Coherence**: The sentence \"He will write a letter.\" is a coherent declarative sentence. It follows typical grammatical structure, ending with a period, and contains no unrelated numbers or special characters besides punctuation.\n\n2. **Word Identification**: The word \"write\" is a valid word in the English language and appears as a single, identifiable term within the sentence. It does not require disambiguation in this context.\n\n3. **Containment**: The word \"write\" is indeed contained within the sentence \"He will write a letter.\"\n\n4. **Absence of Unrelated Characters**: There are no special characters or numbers unrelated to typical sentence structure present.\n\n5. **Non-Empty Input**: Neither the sentence nor the word is empty or consists solely of whitespace. Both inputs contain valid and coherent elements.\n\nBased on these observations, the input complies with the input specification in all aspects, with no violations detected.\n\nOK",
