  "validityText": "The input consists of a sentence and a word from that sentence. \n\n1. **Sentence validity**: The sentence is \"A quick brown fox?\" It seems to follow a coherent sequence of words but ends with a question mark, which is typical for an interrogative sentence. However, without a proper subject-verb-object structure or a clear question formulation, it seems that it's not a fully coherent interrogative sentence. Despite the question mark, the sentence may lack a typical structure of a question.\n\n2. **Word within sentence**: The word \"quick\" is present within the sentence and is a single, identifiable term. \n\n3. **Special characters**: The only special character present is the question mark, which is related to typical sentence structure, but given the context, it adds ambiguity to whether this is a valid question sentence.\n\n4. **Non-empty input**: The sentence and word are non-empty and contain no incorrect characters or whitespace issues.\n\n5. **Straightforward word**: The word \"quick\" is straightforward in the context of the sentence and does not require disambiguation.\n\nBased on these observations:\n- The primary issue is whether \"A quick brown fox?\" truly forms a coherent interrogative sentence. While it ends with a question mark, the sentence structure does not form a clear question nor aligns with standard grammatical constructs for questions.\n\nConsidering these aspects, the core violation comes from the potential incoherence of the sentence as an interrogative form due to lack of a clear question or proper structure. The rules specify that the sentence must be a coherent form of a declarative, interrogative, imperative, or exclamatory statement, which this arguably fails to satisfy.\n\nERR",
