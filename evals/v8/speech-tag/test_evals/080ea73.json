It does not contain any special characters or numbers unrelated to typical sentence structure. The specified word \"you\" is indeed a single, identifiable term found within the given sentence. There is no requirement for disambiguation for the word \"you\" within the context of the sentence, and it is a valid word in the English language.

Based on the provided list of part-of-speech tags in the description, \"PRON\" is not included. The description specifies that if the word cannot be tagged with the listed tags, the output should be \"Unknown,\" and if unable to tag the word, it should be \"CantAnswer.\" Since \"PRON\" is not one of the valid tags or specified fallback responses, the output violates the description.\n\nERR",
