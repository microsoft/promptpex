Let's evaluate it according to the provided specification rules:\n\n1. **Sentence Coherence**: The sentence \"Wow, that's amazing!\" is coherent and is exclamatory, thus forming a coherent sequence of words according to the specification.\n\n2. **Word Containment**: The word \"Wow\" is contained within the sentence.\n\n3. **Valid Sentence and Word**: The sentence is appropriately structured for an exclamatory sentence and the word \"Wow\" is a valid word that fits within the sentence structure.\n\n4. **Special Characters**: The sentence contains punctuation, which is typical of an exclamatory sentence. The comma and exclamation mark are essential parts of sentence structure.\n\n5. **Input Integrity**: The string input is not empty and does not consist solely of whitespace. \n\n6. **Word Specification**: The word \"Wow\" is a straightforward exclamatory part in the context of the sentence and doesn't require disambiguation.\n\nBased on these points, the given input complies with all the conditions of the input specification.\n\nOK",

  "coverageEvalText": "The output provided by the chatbot is \"Interjection.\" According to the guidelines, the chatbot is supposed to return only the part of speech tag. \"Interjection\" is a part of speech but it is not one of the tags listed in the task description. The correct part of speech tag for an interjection, according to the provided list, is \"UH.\" Therefore, the output does not comply with the description as it does not return a valid tag from the given list.\n\nThe specific violation is that the chatbot output does not match any of the part of speech tags provided in the description. The output instead gives a full part of speech name instead of the required tag abbreviation.\n\nERR",
