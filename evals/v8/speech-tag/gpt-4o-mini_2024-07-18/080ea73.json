According to the description, the chatbot is supposed to return only the part of speech tag for the given word from the list of defined tags. \"PRP\" is indeed one of the specified tags (Personal pronoun), which means the output format aligns with what is required. The description also states that if the word cannot be tagged with the listed tags, it should return \"Unknown\", and if it is unable to tag at all, it should return \"CantAnswer\". However, since \"PRP\" is a valid tag from the provided list, there is no visible violation of the guidelines in the output.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
