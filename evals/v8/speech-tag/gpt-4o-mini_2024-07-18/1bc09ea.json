If the word cannot be tagged with the listed tags, return \"Unknown\", and if unable to tag the word, return \"CantAnswer\". The output \"PRP\" is one of the tags in the provided list, specifically representing a \"Personal pronoun\". \n\nSince there is no requirement to know the input to verify compliance, we focus on the format and completeness of the response.
