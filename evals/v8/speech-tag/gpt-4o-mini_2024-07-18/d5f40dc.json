The instructions specify that if a word cannot be tagged with the listed tags, then the output should be \"Unknown.\" This response aligns with the option available in the description for words that do not fall into the provided list of part-of-speech tags. There is no indication in the output that violates the rules, and since no input is given to check the correctness, I can conclude that the output complies with the rules set in the description.\n\nOK"
