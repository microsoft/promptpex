According to the list of tags provided, \"VB\" is a recognized tag for \"Verb, base form.\"\n\n2. **Extraneous Characters**: The presence of the character \"兮\" alongside the tag \"VB\" is not compliant with the instruction to return \"only the part of speech tag.\" There should be no additional characters or symbols.\n\nAccording to the rules, the output should strictly be one of the tags or specific responses such as \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer.\" Any deviation from this violates the description requirements. The inclusion of a non-English character violates these requirements.\n\nERR"
