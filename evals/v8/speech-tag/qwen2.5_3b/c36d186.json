There are no extraneous elements or additional text provided in the output, which aligns with the instruction to return only the part of speech tag. Since there is nothing else in the output except the tag itself, and since it doesn't require knowing the input to confirm the output's format and adherence to the guidelines, the output complies with the description provided.\n\nOK"
