It is important to check if the output is one of the part of speech tags listed or one of the valid outputs in situations where a tag cannot be determined, like \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\". Since \"VBZ\" is indeed a part of speech tag used in the task (specifically for Verb, 3rd person singular present), the output complies with the description requirements of returning just the tag for the word's part of speech. There are no violations in terms of format or content as per the description. \n\nNo violation.\nOK"
