The description specifies that the chatbot should output a list of extracted entities structured with specific categories: company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. However, instead of providing this structured extraction, the chatbot asks for the text to be analyzed, indicating it did not perform the required task of extracting and categorizing entities. The request for the text inherently suggests that the extraction process has not been carried out, which violates the task's guidelines.\n\nERR"
