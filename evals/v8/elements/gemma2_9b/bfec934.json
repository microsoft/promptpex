The output consists of a prompt requesting text input from the user, and it specifies the format it will present the extractions in, but there are no actual extracted entities present. The description requires the chatbot to output the entities extracted from a given text, but here the chatbot is essentially asking for input without presenting an extraction.\n\nERR"
