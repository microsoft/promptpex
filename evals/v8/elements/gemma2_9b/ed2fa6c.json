  "complianceText": "The output is structured almost according to the chatbot's description, listing each category in a logical sequence: Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes.\n\nUpon careful examination, a couple of issues are noted with the format prescribed by the description:\n\n1. **Formatting**: The desired format is to have a comma-separated list for each category without additional text (e.g., prefix like *None mentioned in the text.*). However, the output wraps around the names with additional text, for instance, \"*None mentioned in the text.*\". Ideally, it should present the categories as blank following a colon if there are no entities to list, as per the expected format.\n\n2. **Additional Text**: The final sentence, \"Let me know if you have another text you'd like me to analyze!\" does not adhere to the expected format which strictly limits the output to the entity lists.\n\nDue to these deviations from the strictly expected output format, the chatbot output does not fully comply with the description provided.\n\nERR"
