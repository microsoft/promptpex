  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is asking for input text to analyze, stating it will follow the desired format once the text is provided. The description provided requires the chatbot to extract entities from a given text and to present them in the specified format.\n\nHowever, the current output does not show an extraction of any entities or present any formatted result of entity extraction; it only describes an intention to perform the task upon receiving input. Therefore, it does not fulfill the primary task stated in the description, which is to deliver an extraction result in the specified format. \n\nThe essence of the task is to output extracted entities when text is provided, not to ask for text to be given. Even though it might be logically inferred that the text needs to be given for the extraction to happen, the output here is not in compliance because it doesn't perform or present the extraction task as per the description.\n\nERR"
