The desired format specifies extracting \"company names\" and \"people names.\" The chatbot output has left the sections for \"Company names\" and \"People names\" empty. While it's possible that there might not be any to extract without the actual text, it should be verified with input whether this is the case. However, this cannot be evaluated without the text, so this part of the compliance check can be ignored.\n\n2. The description requires the chatbot's response to conform strictly to the format presented, but the output includes an additional line: \"Let me know if you'd like me to analyze any other texts!\" which is not part of the specified desired format.\n\nDue to the output containing an additional part not in the specified format, it does not fully comply with the provided description.\n\nERR"
