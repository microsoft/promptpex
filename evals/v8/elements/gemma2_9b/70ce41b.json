The format specified in the description requires that all categories (\"Company names,\" \"People names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and \"General themes\") be populated in the output, even if that means indicating no entities were extracted by using a placeholder such as 'None'. In this output, both the \"Company names\" and \"People names\" sections are left completely empty. The required format is not adhered to, as the description mandates a structure that separates categories with colon and lists entities in a comma-separated manner, even if those lists are empty or have a placeholder. \n\nFor these reasons, the chatbot output has violated the description's guidelines regarding the expected format.\n\nERR"
