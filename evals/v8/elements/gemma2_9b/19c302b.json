The description requires only a direct presentation of the extracted entities in the predefined format without any additional commentary.\n\nBased on the description provided, the inclusion of extra commentary that is not part of the specified output format constitutes a violation. The output should solely consist of the formatted extracted information as per the description without additional remarks.\n\nTherefore, due to the presence of unnecessary commentary in the output, it does not fully comply with the description requirements.\n\nERR"
