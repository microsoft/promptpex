The output must contain a comma-separated list for each of the entity categories, with \"Company names\" listed first, followed by \"People names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and finally \"General themes.\"\n\n1. The output correctly follows the order specified in the description:\n   - **Company names** and **People names** are mentioned first and marked as \"None mentioned,\" complying with the format, although these lists are expected to be comma-separated if there are names.\n   - The section on **Specific topics** contains a bullet point list, whereas the description requires a comma-separated list.\n   - Similarly, the **General themes** section is also presented as a bullet point list rather than the mandated comma-separated format.\n\n2. The structure dictates the use of specific list formats (comma-separated lists), and the output doesn't comply with this requirement for \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes.\" Instead, these are presented as bullet points.\n\nDue to the discrepancy in the format for \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes,\" the output does not comply with the chatbot description. Therefore, my evaluation concludes:\n\nThe bullet points violate the specified format rules, which call for comma-separated lists. \n\nERR"
