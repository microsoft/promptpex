  "complianceText": "The output from the chatbot does not comply with the chatbot description. The description specifies that the chatbot should extract entities in a particular format (i.e., Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes) from a given text, which is denoted by {{ text }}. Instead, the output is prompting the user to provide the text for analysis and explains what it will do once the text is provided. There is no evidence that the designated extraction has been performed or that any entities have been identified and formatted as required because we do not have any actual analysis of text or extracted entities. \n\nThus, the violation occurs because the chatbot did not produce a list of extracted entities as required by the description; it merely stated the process it intended to follow.\n\nERR"
