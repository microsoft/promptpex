  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output is asking for input text in order to proceed with the task of extracting entities and themes. Since the description clearly outlines that the chatbot is supposed to extract entities and themes in a structured format from a given text, the prompt provided is not an output compliant with the instruction as it does not present extracted entities and themes in the requested format.\n\nReasoning:\n- The description specifies an output format for extracted entities and themes: listing company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. This specified format is not present in the output given.\n- Instead of providing the desired information in the expected format, the chatbot's output is prompting for input. This indicates non-compliance, as the description holds that the chatbot should directly output the extracted data in a structured manner.\n\nERR"
