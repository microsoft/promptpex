  "coverageEvalText": "The chatbot output lists the entities in the requested format but with missing items. According to the desired format, the \"Company names\" and \"People names\" sections should contain information. However, these sections are empty. The guidelines specify that the output should extract and list all company and people names; the absence of content in these sections despite being listed violates the output format requirements. Therefore, my reasoning leads to the conclusion that there is non-compliance with the chatbot description.\n\nERR",
