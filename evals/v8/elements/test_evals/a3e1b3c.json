Here, \"Specific topics\" includes \"scientific discovery\", and \"General themes\" lists \"radical ideas\" and \"boundaries\". Although we cannot confirm the relevance without the text, the format structure complies with the requirement.\n\nThere is no deviation from the desired output format stipulated in the description provided. Despite not knowing the input and the correctness of entities or topics, the structural compliance with the requested format rules has been met.\n\nOK",
