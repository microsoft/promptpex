  "validityText": "The input text is a coherent passage that contains a complete sentence. It mentions the specific topic of \"cybersecurity breaches\" and references \"large corporations,\" which can be interpreted as a mention of company names or general themes relevant to the content. The text is structured in such a way that the entities, such as the topic of cybersecurity and the reference to large corporations, can be clearly identified. There are no restrictions on the length, and all required aspects of the input specification are adhered to. Thus, this input fully complies with the provided input specification.\n\nOK",

  "coverageEvalText": "The chatbot's output violates the format as the 'Company names' and 'People names' sections are empty. While it is possible that there were no company or people names in the input text, the description does not specify that these sections can be omitted or left blank. The format requires a comma-separated list; if there are none, it would ideally be stated explicitly or acknowledged in a manner consistent with the format, such as by providing terms like \"None.\" Additionally, the \"General themes\" section is incorrectly formatted; it lacks the required spaces after commas.\n\nThere are clear discrepancies between the output and the desired format outlined in the description. These discrepancies led to the conclusion that the output doesn't comply with the chatbot's requirements.\n\nERR",
