  "coverageEvalText": "The chatbot's output fails to comply with the description provided. The specific issues are as follows:\n\n1. Missing Elements: The \"Company names\" and \"People names\" sections are completely empty. According to the description, these sections should contain lists of entities, even if the lists are empty. There should at least be some indication (e.g., a placeholder) to show that the extraction was attempted.\n\n2. Formatting Issue: The section titles \"Company names\" and \"People names\" are followed by colons as specified, but they are not populated with any content, which makes it non-compliant with the expected output where either a list of names or a placeholder should be visible.\n\nGiven these points, the output does not comply with the rule that all sections must contain some content or a placeholder indicating that extraction was attempted. \n\nERR",
