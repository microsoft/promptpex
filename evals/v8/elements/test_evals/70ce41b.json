  "coverageEvalText": "The chatbot output is evaluated based on the required format specified in the description. The desired format consists of four distinct sections: Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes, each followed by a list. \n\n1. **Company names**: The section is present, but the list is empty. The description requires extracting company names. However, without knowing the input, I cannot determine if there were no company names in the text. Therefore, we cannot conclude a violation here.\n\n2. **People names**: Similar to Company names, the section is present but contains an empty list. Again, without the input, we cannot assess if there should have been any people names. Thus, this cannot be considered a violation based on available information.\n\n3. **Specific topics**: This section is present and contains the topic \"AI.\" This follows the format as per the description.\n\n4. **General themes**: This section is also present, including \"investments\" and \"technology,\" complying with the specified format.\n\nBased on the compliance checks that do not require knowing the input, the output adheres to the specified format in the description. There are no apparent formatting violations.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",
