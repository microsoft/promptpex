  "validityText": "The input text is a single sentence stating that new studies show a drop in interest towards non-sustainable startups. The input specification requires that the text must be a coherent passage containing complete sentences, and this sentence fulfills that requirement as it is complete and coherent. The text mentions a specific topic, which is non-sustainable startups, relevant to the content. The passage is structured in a way that entities (in this case, non-sustainable startups) can be clearly identified. Although the input is brief, there are no specified restrictions on the length of the input text by the specification, so the single complete sentence is acceptable. There are no company or people names mentioned, but they are optional according to the specification.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",

  "coverageEvalText": "The chatbot's output does not fully comply with the description provided. The reasons for this conclusion are as follows:\n\n1. The format for all categories should be clear and consistent as specified in the description. However, the \"company names\" and \"people names\" sections are missing the placeholder or indication of information. This violates the requirement to list entities as a comma-separated list, even if no entities are found. The entry should still contain a placeholder indicating that no relevant entities were found.\n\n2. There are missing or empty sections for \"company names\" and \"people names,\" which were expected to be explicitly present even if empty indicating no relevant entities. The output needs to be consistent in format whether or not any specific names are identified.\n\n3. Finally, the format specified in the description explicitly requires each list to be comma-separated, but since those lists are missing in the output, the requirement regarding format compliance is violated.\n\nBased on these reasons, the chatbot's output does not comply with the description provided.\n\nERR",
