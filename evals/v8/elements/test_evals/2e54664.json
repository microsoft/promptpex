  "coverageEvalText": "The chatbot description specifies that the output should include lists for \"Company names\", \"People names\", \"Specific topics\", and \"General themes\", with each list consisting of a comma-separated format. In the provided output:\n\n1. The \"Company names\" field is empty, which may be acceptable if there were no company names in the input, however, since we are evaluating compliance without knowing the input, we cannot determine if this is a violation.\n\n2. The \"People names\" field is also empty, which might be fine in the absence of people names in the text.\n\n3. The \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\" fields both contain comma-separated lists, adhering to the formatting guidelines.\n\nThe guidelines specify to not make assumptions or inferences that require input knowledge, and since all other requirements are met correctly within the possible context of this evaluation, there are no explicit compliance issues in the formatting or structure.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",
