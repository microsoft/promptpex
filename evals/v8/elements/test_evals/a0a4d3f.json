  "rule": "Finally, the output must conclude with \"General themes:\" followed by a list of broader, overarching themes identified from the text, also separated by commas with no additional spaces between themes.",
  "input": "Text: Sustainability and innovation shape corporate strategies.",
  "validityText": "The input text \"Sustainability and innovation shape corporate strategies.\" consists of one complete sentence, which adheres to the requirement for the input text to be coherent and contain complete sentences. It includes general themes, specifically \"sustainability\" and \"innovation,\" which are specific topics relevant to the content within a corporate context. The structure of the sentence allows for the identification of these themes. While there are no specific company names or people names mentioned, the specification indicates that these can be included, not that they must be included. There are no specified restrictions on the length of the input text, and a single complete sentence is sufficient to meet the criteria of the input specification.\n\nTherefore, the input complies with the input specification, as it meets the requirements regarding coherence, completeness, and thematic content.\n\nOK",

  "coverageEvalText": "The chatbot's output must adhere to the specified format, which includes extracting and listing entities under distinct categories: company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. Firstly, the 'Company names' and 'People names' fields are empty, which is compliant because we do not know from the description if there are any entities to extract in these categories. However, what does not comply with the specified format is that the 'Specific topics' and 'General themes' lists should be comma-separated. Here, the 'General themes' have correctly used commas between 'sustainability' and 'innovation', which is compliant, but the 'Specific topics' section does not present a comma-separated list.\n\nTherefore, due to the format issue in 'Specific topics', the output doesn't comply with the desired structure outlined in the description.\n\nERR",
