The sentence does not blatantly violate any particular rule from the input specification. It does not necessarily need to mention company names, people names or overarching themes explicitly as these are optional according to the specification. It conveys a complete idea within a single sentence and maintains clarity and structure which allows the topic to be clearly identified.\n\nOK",

  "coverageEvalText": "The chatbot output lacks any mentioned company names and people names, leaving these sections empty. This could potentially comply with the description if there were no company or people names mentioned in the text, but since I do not have the input text, I cannot verify this requirement. The format provided is correct as it adheres to the required: \"Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\", \"People names: -||-\", \"Specific topics: -||-\", and \"General themes: -||-\". Therefore, based on the visible structure, the output follows the given format and complies with the description, pending the missing input verification.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",
