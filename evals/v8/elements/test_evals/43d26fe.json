This complies with the requirement for the input to be a coherent passage containing complete sentences.\n\n2. **Inclusion of Specific Topics**: The input text includes a specific topic, which is \"virtual reality,\" suggesting an area of interest or discussion.\n\n3. **Clear Identification of Entities**: While the input does not explicitly mention company names or people names, it does mention the specific topic \"virtual reality,\" fulfilling the requirement to clearly identify entities within the text.\n\nOverall, the input text satisfies all the criteria outlined in the input specification.

  "coverageEvalText": "The chatbot's output partially follows the required format. It includes the four categories specified in the description: Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes. However, the \"Company names\" and \"People names\" fields are left empty and also do not contain the placeholder \"-||-\" to indicate an empty list of names. \n\nThis violates the description's guideline of providing a comma-separated list of entities or a placeholder \"-||-\" for each category. The correct format should have been:\n\nCompany names: -||-\nPeople names: -||-\nSpecific topics: virtual reality\nGeneral themes: technology, growth\n\nDue to these format issues in the chatbot's output, the evaluation result is 'ERR'.\n\nERR",
