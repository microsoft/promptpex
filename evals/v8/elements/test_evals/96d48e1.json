  "coverageEvalText": "The chatbot output is expected to be in the specified format, which includes four categories: Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes. \n\n1. **Company names**: The output should contain a comma-separated list, but here it is empty. Without knowing the input, we cannot assess the correctness of this decision, so we ignore this part in compliance checking.\n\n2. **People names**: Similarly to company names, this section is also empty. Compliance checking does not require content correctness, so we ignore this part.\n\n3. **Specific topics**: The output provides \"medicine\" and \"green technology\" as specific topics. These are given as a comma-separated list, which is compliant with the desired format.\n\n4. **General themes**: The output lists \"technological advancements\" as the general theme. This adheres to the expected format, where broad themes are to be included.\n\nThe following points about compliance with the format can be made:\n- Even if categories are empty, the labels (Company names, People names, etc.) are correctly included, maintaining the required structure.\n- Both the Specific topics and General themes are presented in the correct comma-separated list format.\n\nBased on these observations, the chatbot output complies with the format as specified in the description. There is no indication of non-compliance with maintaining the structured format as required. \n\nNo violation.\nOK",
