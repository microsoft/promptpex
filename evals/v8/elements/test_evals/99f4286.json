  "validityText": "The input text is a coherent passage containing a complete sentence. It mentions names of people, Elon Musk and Ariana Huffington, who are recognized as notable individuals. The sentence introduces the theme of innovation associated with these individuals. Therefore, the input meets the requirement of containing complete sentences, and the entities (names of people) are clearly identified.\n\nOK",

  "coverageEvalText": "The chatbot's output attempts to comply with the desired format described in the guidelines by including sections for company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. However, the 'Company names' section is left blank, which does not explicitly comply with the format guidelines that expect a comma-separated list of company names. Even if no company names were found in the input text, the expectation based on the format suggests that there should not just be empty space following the label without some indication like \"None\" or similar. Therefore, because the 'Company names:' field just has a space thereafter instead of a compliant term or a filled content as indicated in the format description, this output does not strictly adhere to the expectation.\n\nERR",
