Instead of listing names or indicating none, the output uses the placeholder \"-||-\", which is not mentioned in the description format.\n\n2. The \"Company names\" field uses \"None\" which is fine, but it should be consistent with \"People names\".\n\nThe output should follow the format provided in the description explicitly for each category. The use of \"-||-\" deviates from the prescribed format, which indicates either a list or a clear indication of absence (like \"None\").\n\nERR"
