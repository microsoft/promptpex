  "complianceText": "In evaluating the chatbot output, several points of non-compliance with the described format are evident:\n\n1. **Format Issues**: The output does not follow the specified comma-separated list format for each category. Even though the chatbot states that there are no company or people names extracted, it does not explicitly use the placeholder stylistically provided -||- in the description, as required.\n\n2. **Excessive Information**: The chatbot output provides more details, such as the mention of \"Google and Amazon\" and additional explanations for \"Sustainability\" and \"Innovation\" within the \"General Themes\" that are not needed. The description does not ask for explanations or references beyond the requested list format.\n\nBased on these observations, the output contains violations related to adherence to the specified format and additional information not described in the output guidelines, thus leading to non-compliance.\n\nERR"
