  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not comply with the description for several reasons:\n\n1. The format specified in the description requires company names and people names to be listed in a comma-separated list. The output deviates by using a bullet point followed by \"None mentioned\" for company names instead of using the required format which should be \"Company names: None mentioned\" or \"Company names: \". Additionally, for people names, it uses \"-||-\", which does not adhere to the format specified in the description (a comma-separated list, even if empty).\n\nGiven these points of non-compliance with the specified format, I must conclude that the output does not adhere to the requirements.\n\nERR"
