  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is not compliant with the prescribed format described in the chatbot description. \n\n1. The \"Company names\" section correctly indicates that none are mentioned.\n2. The \"People names\" section erroneously mentions Leonardo da Vinci along with a note that is inappropriate according to the guidelines since no people names should appear if none are identified in the content.\n3. The output does not adhere strictly to the list format in certain areas:\n   - The \"People names\" section includes additional context and a note which was not asked for in the formatting instructions.\n4. The \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\" are correctly formatted in a list, but the issue remains with the inappropriate handling of the \"People names\" section.\n\nBased on the guidelines and the format requested, the inclusion of unnecessary commentary within the \"People names\" section violates the strict format requirement.\n\nERR"
