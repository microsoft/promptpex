The format specifies that it should contain a comma-separated list or a hyphen-separated list if applicable. In the chatbot output, it is presented as a solitary hyphen '-', which does not align with the format specified. If there are no names, it should explicitly state 'None', similar to how the \"Company names\" section was handled. This discrepancy in formatting is sufficient to conclude non-compliance.\n\nERR"
