  "complianceText": "The output is structured in the required format, listing company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes, each with its own section. However, there is a slight deviation in the presentation of people names and specific topics sections:\n\n1. In the \"People names\" section, instead of an empty field which aligns with the format for an empty list, the chatbot has written \"- No specific individuals\". This description is not in the compliant format which asks for the <comma_separated_list_of_people_names>.\n\n2. In the \"Specific topics\" section, the expected format is directly listing the topics separated by commas. The inclusion of a dash before \"General themes\" deviates from the prescribed format of listing items directly.\n\nDue to the deviation in expected format with additional text in the \"People names\" and \"Specific topics\", and 'General themes', I conclude that there is non-compliance with the description's requirements.\n\nERR"
