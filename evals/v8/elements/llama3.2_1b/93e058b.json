  "complianceText": "The chatbot output provides lists for company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes as required by the description. However, there are several elements which lead to non-compliance:\n\n1. The description specifies using a comma-separated list format for each category. The output correctly uses hyphens (|-||-) for empty lists and simple text for the other categories.\n\n2. For company names, the output gives \"-|\", however, the specified format for empty lists hasn't been matched exactly as described. It should either be consistent as a single placeholder per format or a minor deviation.\n\n3. People names list is given correctly as required by the format using \"-||-\".\n\n4. Specific topics and general themes lists are provided clearly.\n\nThus my final decision stands: \n\nThere is no explicit specification for empty lists except setting a consistent format since it's subjective and involves symmetrical logic.\n\nOK"
