  "complianceText": "The output begins by listing company names, specifically \"Nestle\" and \"Kraft Heinz,\" which is compliant with the format requested. It then lists \"People names\" as \"-||-\", indicating there are likely no relevant people names extracted from the text. This follows the specified format since it maintains consistency across categories, suggesting no entities fell under this category.\n\nFor \"Specific topics,\" it lists \"Food and beverage\" and \"Brand heritage,\" and for \"General themes,\" it lists \"Nutrition\" and \"Consumer goods,\" both in the form of comma-separated lists, which again complies with the required format. There are no obvious formatting errors or omissions in categories according to the description given. Each section is clearly separated and identified as per instructions.\n\nTherefore, the output format complies with the guidelines provided, and there's no part of the formatting that requires interaction or assumption not justified by the given output.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
