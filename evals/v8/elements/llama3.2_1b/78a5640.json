Each category's entities are listed in a comma-separated format, which complies with the required structure. Additionally, the chatbot provides a separate section that only lists the companies and people mentioned, which still falls within compliance as it does not contradict the requirement of the previous section. There are no explicit violations of the compliance rules per the description, as it adheres to the structured format and presents all four categories in sequence with the expected formatting.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
