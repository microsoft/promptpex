The description requires the output to clearly categorize the extracted information into four sections: Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes.\n\n1. **Company Names** and **People Names** sections are correctly formatted and contain the statement \"None mentioned,\" which complies with the format as the description allows for company names and people names to be absent in the text.\n\n2. **Specific Topics** and **General Themes** sections both present separate lists with bullet points, which aligns with the specification that these areas should list topics and themes relevant to the text.\n\nUpon reviewing the provided output, each section is distinctly and properly listed, and there are no apparent violations of the required format or structure. The output abides by the guideline of listing the entities separately in a clear, categorized manner.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
