  "complianceText": "The output does not comply with the description for several reasons:\n\n1. The format for each category should be a comma-separated list. In this output, the lists are not all formatted as such; for example, specific topics appear as a bullet-point list instead of a comma-separated list.\n\n2. The description specifies that company names and people names should be extracted with clarity, but the format here uses \"None mentioned\" and a note about a reference to artificial intelligence, which does not follow the expected format of a comma-separated list.\n\n3. The word \"mentioned\" is inconsistent with the desired format, which specifies extracting and listing entities without such commentary.\n\nThese points indicate that the output does not completely align with the specified format requirements. \n\nERR"
