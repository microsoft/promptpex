  "complianceText": "The output is structured in the desired format provided in the description. The categories \"Company names\", \"People names\", \"Specific topics\", and \"General themes\" are all present. However, there seems to be an inconsistency with the \"People names\" category. According to the template, it should be a comma-separated list, yet a '-' is used, which might suggest a placeholder approach or an attempt to convey absence, although the template does not explicitly prescribe this symbol for absence. Using \"None mentioned\" for \"Company names\" suggests that absence of entities should be expressed in words instead of placeholder characters. Therefore, the inconsistency between how the absence is marked in the \"Company names\" and \"People names\" categories is a minor violation.\n\nThe specific reason for considering it a violation is due to the deviation from the explicit instruction which seems consistent with spelling out absences as demonstrated in the \"Company names\" section. It is crucial to adhere to similar expressions of absence to maintain uniformity across all entity types.\n\nERR"
