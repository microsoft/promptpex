The task requires listing all categories even if they contain no entities, yet some lists (Company names and People names) are marked as 'None', which suggests absence rather than listing an empty list as per typical interpretation unless stated otherwise. Each category should still conform with the format described ('comma_separated_list_of_company_names', etc.), and the absence should be represented properly, for instance, through an empty list or consistent format with description. Additionally, it is incorrect to use 'None' as a substitute for a comma-separated list. \n\nERR"
