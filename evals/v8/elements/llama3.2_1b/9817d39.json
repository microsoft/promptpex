  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output does not comply with the description format in several ways. Firstly, the \"Company names\" section lists \"None mentioned in the given text\" rather than leaving it as an empty comma-separated list if there were none. Secondly, the \"People names\" section uses \"-||-\" to indicate that there are no names, which is compliant with the desired format. The \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\" sections do follow the general desired format but the issue lies primarily with the non-standard way of indicating the absence of company names, which breaks consistency with the rest of the structure. The description requires a comma-separated list, and the output did not provide that for company names.\n\nERR"
