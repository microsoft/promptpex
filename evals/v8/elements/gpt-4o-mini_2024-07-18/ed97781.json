The description specifies using a comma-separated list for all sections, including 'People names'. The output for 'People names' should not include the \"-||-\" format but instead should follow the same format as other sections with a comma-separated list, even if empty.\n\n2. **Consistency Across Lists**: All sections should mirror the format shown for 'Company names', using a comma-separated list. The current output violates this by providing the incorrect format for one of the sections.\n\nBased on these observations, the output does not follow the exact phrasing and structural guidelines described.\n\nERR"
