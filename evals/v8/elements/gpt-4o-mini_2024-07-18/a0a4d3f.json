However, the section for company names is empty, which does not comply with the description's directive to extract all company names mentioned in the text. According to the description, the chatbot should list company names in a comma-separated list or indicate explicitly if there are none, for example by stating \"None.\" Merely leaving the section blank is not compliant with the required format. This oversight leads me to conclude that there is a violation.\n\nThe violation occurs because the \"Company names\" section is left blank without indicating \"None,\" which breaks the compliance with the output format requirements.\n\nERR"
