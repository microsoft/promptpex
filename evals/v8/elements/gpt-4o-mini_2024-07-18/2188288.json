The issues I found are as follows:\n\n1. **Company names**: The output section for company names is empty. There is no compliant placeholder text or indication of \"N/A\" or None,\" which should be present if there are no entities to list.\n\n2. **People names**: The output correctly uses the placeholder \"-||-\" to indicate no people names are mentioned.\n\n3. **Specific topics**: The output lists \"renewable energy policies,\" which fits the desired format.\n\n4. **General themes**: The output lists \"environmental sustainability, energy transition,\" which also fits the desired format.\n\nThe primary violation is in the \"Company names\" section because it does not even provide a placeholder text to indicate that there are no entities present.\n\nERR"
