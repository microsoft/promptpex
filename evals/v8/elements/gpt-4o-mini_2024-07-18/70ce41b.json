The first element in the output under \"Company names\" is \"tech firms,\" which is not a list of company names but rather a generic category. According to the description, it should list specific company names in a comma-separated list. Additionally, the section \"People names\" uses \"-||-\" rather than explicitly stating \"People names: -||-\". These are violations of the prescribed format.\n\nSince these issues directly contravene the guidelines set out in the description, the output does not comply.\n\nERR"
