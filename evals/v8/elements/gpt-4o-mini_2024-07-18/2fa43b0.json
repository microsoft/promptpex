  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output lists company names, specific topics, and general themes which comply with the specified format in the description. However, the section for people names uses a placeholder (\"-||-\") instead of explicitly stating that there are no people names mentioned or providing an empty list. Since the placeholder is not specified as a part of the desired format in the description, this constitutes a violation. Therefore, the chatbot's output does not fully comply with the exact specifications given.\n\nERR"
