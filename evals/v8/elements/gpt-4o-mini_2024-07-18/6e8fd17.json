It provides lists of entities categorized into \"Company names\", \"People names\", \"Specific topics\", and \"General themes\". Each list is delineated correctly following the specified structure: `<category>: <comma_separated_list_of_entities>`. Moreover, it includes placeholders with \"-||-\" for the \"People names\" category, indicating no entries, which is acceptable.\n\nThere is no mention in the instructions that the lists must be fully populated, so it's reasonable to conclude that the placeholders are appropriate when no entities are available for a category.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
