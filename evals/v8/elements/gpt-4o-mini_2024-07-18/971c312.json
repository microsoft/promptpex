  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output does not comply with the description. According to the description, it is required to list all company names in a comma-separated format. However, in the output, the field for company names is left empty, which indicates non-compliance since the output is required to explicitly list entities or provide a comma-separated list, even if it means the field would be filled incorrectly—it should not be left entirely blank. Each section must contain something, even if it’s a placeholder indicating no entities were found, which typically has a format like \"None\" or similar—not just entirely left out entry.\n\nAdditionally, the required format for the remaining sections seems to be based on the assumption there should be something listed or at least a \"None\" when nothing is found. When the chatbot has nothing to list, such a notation could clarify that the field was considered and not just skipped over.\n\nERR"
