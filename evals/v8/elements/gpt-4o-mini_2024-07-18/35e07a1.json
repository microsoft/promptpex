However, I noticed a rule violation: the \"Company names\" section is left empty. According to the format described, even if there are no company names detected, it's expected to list them in a comma-separated manner or clearly denote that there are none found. An empty section without any explicit indication is not compliant with the format. All other sections are compliant with the description.\n\nERR"
