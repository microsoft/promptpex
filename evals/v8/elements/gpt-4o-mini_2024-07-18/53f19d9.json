Each category — company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes — is included in the output and is clearly separated by colons with comma-separated lists when necessary. There are no areas where the format deviates from the described structure.

Hence, there is no violation in terms of compliance with the structure.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
