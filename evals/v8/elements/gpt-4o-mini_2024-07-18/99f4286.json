  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output is supposed to follow the specified format from the description provided. Here's the breakdown of my evaluation:\n\n1. **Company Names Section**: The format for company names is specified as `<comma_separated_list_of_company_names>`. The output has `-||-`, which does not match the required format of a comma-separated list, indicating non-compliance.\n\n2. **People Names Section**: The format for people names is specified as `-||-`. The output contains actual names (\"Elon Musk, Ariana Huffington\"), which directly violates the required format.\n\n3. **Specific Topics and General Themes Sections**: Both sections seem to appropriately list specific topics and general themes as commas separating entries, fitting the implied expectation. \n\nGiven these observations, the output does not fully comply with the description provided especially concerning how the company names and people names are to be formatted. The direct specification of `-||-` is ignored in the People Names section. Therefore, due to format non-compliance in the People Names and Company names sections, I conclude that the output does not comply with the description.\n\nERR"
