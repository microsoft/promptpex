This format complies with the description, since it is possible that the input text did not mention any company names. \n\n2. **People Names**: The output provides a section labeled \"People names\" but leaves it empty. This is in compliance because the description simply requires such a section to be present, not that it contains names, which cannot be checked without the input.\n\n3. **Specific Topics**: The output provides a section for \"Specific topics\" and lists \"diverse portfolios, retirement planning.\" This complies with the description as these are clearly specific topics related to the content.\n\n4. **General Themes**: The output provides a section for \"General themes\" and lists \"financial planning, investment strategies.\" This also complies with the description, as these are overarching themes relevant to the content.\n\nThe output format uses commas to separate list items, and each section is labeled appropriately as stipulated by the description. Therefore, it complies with the guidelines provided and does not violate any specified format or structure.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
