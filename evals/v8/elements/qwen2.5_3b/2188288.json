  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is presented in the desired format outlined in the description, with sections for company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. However, the section for people names displays '-||-', which should follow the format of a comma-separated list similar to 'Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>'. The same issue applies to specific topics and general themes, which are not being separated by commas. Also, placeholders are used ('-||-'), which do not strictly adhere to the format of comma-separated lists. Specific topics and general themes are provided as lists but without commas separating them. This presents a deviation from the strict format described.\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
