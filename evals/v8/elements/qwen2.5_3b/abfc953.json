  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is not compliant with the description provided. The primary issue with the output is the way it lists the absence of company names. According to the format specified in the description, when there are no entries for a category, it should still adhere to the comma-separated list format. However, the chatbot output uses a placeholder \"<no_company_names>\", which deviates from the expected format. Additionally, both \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\" lists deviate from the expected format; these categories should adhere to a comma-separated list, yet they are incorrectly formatted as individual entries. The use of bullets \"-||-\" for \"People names\" seems to follow the placeholder format given that no names are present, so it's acceptable in that context. Therefore, due to incorrect formatting in the output, the response does not comply with the chatbot's described output format.\n\nERR"
