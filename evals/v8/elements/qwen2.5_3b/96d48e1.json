There are several issues with the output:\n\n1. **Company Names Format**: According to the description, if there are no company names to extract, the output should still follow the format guidelines. The current placeholder \"<no_company_names_in_text>\" does not follow the format of a comma-separated list and is different from what appears to be expected. Thus, it violates the format.\n\n2. **People Names**: The expectation is a list, comma-separated, similar to what was expected for company names. Here it has \"-||-\", which deviates from the comma-separated list format as suggested by the description.\n\nThe output does not follow the format description given for \"Company names\" and \"People names,\" which indicates a non-compliance. \n\nERR"
