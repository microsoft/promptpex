The description does not mention using tags such as `<empty>` to denote absence or lack of content; it expects a comma-separated list.\n\n2. **Placeholders**: The placeholder syntax `-||-` used in the 'People names' field is correct for indicating no content according to the guidelines, assuming there were no people names to extract. However, the use of `<empty>` in the 'Company names' instead of `-||-` indicates inconsistency.\n\nBased on the above observations, these issues indicate non-compliance with the output format specified in the description. \n\nERR"
