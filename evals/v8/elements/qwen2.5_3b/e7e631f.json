  "complianceText": "The format for \"Company names\" in the chatbot output is \"<no_company_names>\", which does not comply with the format specified in the chatbot description. The description requests a comma-separated list of company names. While the actual content of the list cannot be validated without the input, the format \"<no_company_names>\" is not a proper comma-separated list. Additionally, the \"People names\" section uses \"-||-\", which does comply with the description, so there are no format issues here. \n\nSpecific topics and general themes follow the correct format as lists of comma-separated items. However, the issue lies with the specific required format being \"<comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\" for company names, which was not followed due to the use of \"<no_company_names>\". \n\nDue to the formatting violation in the \"Company names\" section, I conclude that the chatbot's output does not fully comply with the description.\n\nERR"
