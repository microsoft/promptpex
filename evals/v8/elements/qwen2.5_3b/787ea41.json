The format of the output is structured to extract entities in the required order: company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. Each category is separated with the expected '-||-' symbol, indicating no entries for that specific category where applicable. The specific topics (\"revolution, gene editing, medicine\") and general themes (\"breakthroughs, promise, transformation\") follow the appropriate format as per the guidelines.\n\nDespite the lack of actual values for \"Company names\" and \"People names\", the output appropriately uses the given placeholder format \"<no_company_names>\" and the \"-||-\" symbol. Given that we cannot verify these lists without the input text, they meet compliance in the format outlined by the instructions. \n\nNo specific rule in the provided description is violated, as the format is correctly followed in listing company names, people names, specific topics, and themes as demanded.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
