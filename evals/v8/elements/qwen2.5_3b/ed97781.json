  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output is supposed to follow the format provided in the description. The output for each category (Company names, People names, Specific topics, General themes) should be separated by commas and not enclosed in any other characters or formats.\n\nMy evaluation of the output:\n\n1. **Company names**: \"Google,Microsoft\" is listed correctly in a comma-separated list. This complies with the description since it is explicitly mentioned in this format.\n2. **People names**: The output uses \"-||-\", which matches the format described for an empty response, complying with the description.\n3. **Specific topics**: The output is \"<tech_giants,_Google,_Microsoft,_industry>\". The description specifies using a comma-separated list without additional characters like '<' and '>'. The presence of these characters makes this part non-compliant.\n4. **General themes**: The output \"<growth,_industry_evolution>\" also uses '<' and '>', which is not specified in the desired format. This results in non-compliance.\n\nBecause the output for Specific topics and General themes includes unnecessary characters or formatting that doesn't match the description, the output does not fully comply with the chatbot description.\n\nERR"
