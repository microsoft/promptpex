  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output is partially compliant with the specified format. The issues observed are:\n\n1. Company names: The chatbot provided \"<no_company_names>\" instead of a comma-separated list. According to the format, it should have left it blank or explicitly stated as \"none\" if there were no company names, however, this does not violate any description since description does not explicitly require it, so this part is compliant.\n\n2. People names: The description requires a comma-separated list for \"People names\" as well. The placeholder \"-||-\" is used, which might imply non-existence based on format guidelines seen in the description, but without knowing the input, this usage complies with format expectations provided.\n\n3. Specific topics and General themes: These sections strictly follow the prescribed format (comma-separated lists).\n\nBased on the evaluation of format adherence alone, no explicit violations to the description are detected regardless of assumed meanings or interpretations. Therefore, under the guidelines given, the output is compliant.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
