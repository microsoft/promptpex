It correctly uses the headings: \"Company names:\", \"People names:\", \"Specific topics:\", and \"General themes:\" followed by a comma-separated list for each category. The phrase \"<no_company_names>\" under \"Company names:\" suggests that it recognized no companies were mentioned, which is acceptable as the description does not specify a minimum requirement for entries. The parallel structure for each category is preserved.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
