While it's possible that there were no company names to extract, the format indicates a comma-separated list should be present if detected. However, this is a point that requires knowing the input.\n\n2. The \"People names\" category also doesn't have any names extracted but follows the format, indicating a list if applicable. This is likewise something that requires knowing the input.\n\n3. The \"Specific topics\" list is present and follows the format correctly, listing \"diversified portfolios, retirement planning\". \n\n4. The \"General themes\" list contains one item, \"financial planning\", which complies with the format requirements.\n\nHowever, the empty \"Company names\" appears to be a point of potential non-compliance due to non-format conformity. Therefore:\n\nNo explicit violations, considering much requires knowing the input.\nOK"
