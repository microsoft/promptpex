  "complianceText": "The chatbot output generally aligns with the desired format. It segments the extracted entities into four clearly defined categories: company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. Each section is correctly formatted with a comma-separated list (or appropriate format when only one item is present) which adheres to the layout specified in the description.\n\nCompany Names and People Names sections have the lists in a comma-separated format as required. However, in the People Names section, the separator used is a comma instead of the expected separator '-||-'. \n\nThe Specific Topics and General Themes sections also correctly list items with commas separating different entities. Each category reflects the kind of information expectedâ€”specific topics are more focused on aspects directly mentioned in the text, while general themes provide a broader context or area that the text covers.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the error with the separator in the People Names section is a clear deviation from the format specified in the description. This results in non-compliance.\n\nERR"
