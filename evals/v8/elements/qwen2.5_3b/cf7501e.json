  "complianceText": "The chatbot output generally follows the desired format. However, there is a repetition in the company names where \"Oracle\" appears twice. The description specifies a \"<comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\", implying that each company name should be listed only once. Therefore, having a duplicate entry in the list violates the expected format. Despite this, the output sections for people names, specific topics, and general themes adhere to the required structure.\n\nThe violation stems from the duplication of \"Oracle\" in the company names list, which should be a unique, comma-separated list as per the description guidelines.\n\nERR"
