The output format is specified clearly in the description:\n\n1. **Company names** should be listed as a comma-separated list. In the output, the field for company names is empty, but this cannot be evaluated for compliance without the input text.\n   \n2. **People names** are not provided and marked as -||-, which means no people names were extracted. Again, without knowing the input, this can't be deemed as non-compliant.\n\n3. For **specific topics**, the output lists \"healthcare reforms, political parties.\" This part appears to comply with the format and requirement specified in the description.\n\n4. For **general themes**, \"discussions, policies, government divisions\" are listed, which follows the required format.\n\nThe output follows the structure provided in the description, listing entities under the appropriate categories and separating items with commas. There is no explicit formatting violation in regards to the provided structure and text labels.\n\nThus, based on the directly observable information, the output complies with the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
