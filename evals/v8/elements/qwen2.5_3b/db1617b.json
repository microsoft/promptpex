  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not comply with the description. According to the provided format in the description, the chatbot should list the items in a comma-separated format without adding \"No specific individuals\" to each list. Each category should contain the respective entities, and if a category has no items to list, it should be left empty or possibly omitted entirely; it should not include a statement such as \"No specific individuals.\" \n\nSpecifically:\n- The \"Company names\" section unreasonably repeats \"No specific individuals.\"\n- The \"People names\" section uses the inappropriate phrase \"No specific individuals\" instead of simply leaving it blank or omitting it.\n- The \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\" sections unnecessarily add \"No specific individuals.\" \n\nTherefore, these additions deviate from the format specified in the description.\n\nERR"
