Additionally, each sentence contains multiple `<em>` tags, which further emphasize important words or phrases. As there are three sets of `<p>` tags and the required `<strong>` and `<em>` tags within each, the output complies with the guidelines provided in the description. No part of the evaluation required knowledge of the input, so direct compliance with the output was evaluated.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
