Each `<p>` tag includes one `<strong>` tag, meeting the requirement to have at least one `<strong>` tag per sentence. However, there is a notable issue with the presence of `<u>` (underline) tags, which are neither mentioned nor allowed in the description. Specifically, the description instructs the inclusion of `<strong>` and `<em>` tags, but makes no mention of `<u>` tags. Thus, the incorporation of this additional HTML element constitutes a violation of the compliance rules, as it deviates from the explicit instructions provided in the description.\n\nERR"
