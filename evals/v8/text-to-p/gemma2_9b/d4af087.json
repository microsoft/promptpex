Each <p> tag contains one <strong> tag, which is also consistent with the requirement. The first two <p> tags contain multiple <em> tags, which aligns with the guidelines of having multiple <em> tags to emphasize key words and phrases. However, the third <p> tag contains a formatting issue: it uses **experiences** instead of <em>experiences</em> or another <strong> or <em> tag. This inconsistency in formatting within the HTML tags indicates non-compliance with the description, which requires the use of <em> and <strong> tags specifically. This error in the third <p> tag is a clear violation of the guidelines provided.\n\nERR"
