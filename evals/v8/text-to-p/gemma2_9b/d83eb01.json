Inside these `<p>` tags, there are `<strong>` and `<em>` tags present which emphasize certain words. \n\nFirst paragraph: Contains a `<strong>` tag for \"Internet\" and two `<em>` tags for \"privacy\" and \"concern.\"\n\nSecond paragraph: Contains two `<em>` tags for \"data\" and \"exploited,\" but no `<strong>` tag.\n\nThird paragraph: Contains a `<strong>` tag for \"Legislation\" and three `<em>` tags for \"evolving,\" \"protect,\" and \"consumers.\"\n\nAlthough the second paragraph lacks a `<strong>` tag, the description doesn't explicitly require every paragraph to have a `<strong>` tag specifically, only that at least one is present overall. There are `<strong>` tags in the output, satisfying the inclusion requirement as a whole.\n\nSince there is no explicit description stating that each paragraph must contain `<strong>` tags (just at least one per the whole output), the output meets the compliance requirements provided in the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
