  "complianceText": "The chatbot output contains three <p> tags, which satisfies the rule that states the answer should have at least three <p> tags. Each <p> tag includes a <strong> tag, highlighting a word at the start of each sentence, and there are multiple <em> tags to emphasize key words and phrases within each sentence. This matches the requirement of the description to use both <strong> and <em> tags within each <p> tag. As such, there are no visible violations of the chatbot's description based solely on the output provided.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
