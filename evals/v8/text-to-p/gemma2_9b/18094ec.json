The output contains three <p> tags, which satisfies the condition of having at least three.\n2. Each <p> tag wraps a single sentence; hence, the instructions to split the paragraph into sentences and wrap each in a <p> tag appear to be followed.\n3. Within each <p> tag, there is exactly one <strong> tag highlighting a word and at least one <em> tag to emphasize other words. This satisfies the requirement for adding one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags to emphasize key words or phrases inside each <p> tag.\n4. Although there is additional text (\"Let me know if you'd like to experiment...\"), this does not interfere with the compliance of the HTML formatting and can be considered extra commentary rather than a breach of the outlined task.\n\nSince all mandatory elements of the description are directly and explicitly complied with in this output, except for those needing input knowledge, the decision is:\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
