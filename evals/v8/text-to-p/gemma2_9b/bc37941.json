  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not comply with the description for the following reasons:\n\n1. The description requires each sentence in the paragraph to contain at least one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags. In the output provided:\n   - The first paragraph has one <strong> tag but only one <em> tag used for spacing, which does not qualify as meaningful emphasis on a specific word.\n   - The second paragraph has one <strong> tag and one <em> tag, which meets the requirement of having an <em> tag. However, it should have multiple <em> tags as required by the description.\n   - The third paragraph has one <strong> tag and no <em> tags at all.\n   \n2. Additionally, the presence of a <span> tag does not comply with the specification, which only mentions the usage of <strong> and <em> tags for emphasis.\n\n3. The output has only three <p> tags which means there is no issues with the number of <p> tags as the description only mentions at least three and does not put any upper limit.\n\nOverall, the lack of adherence to the usage of multiple <em> tags for emphasizing key words and phrases, as well as the inclusion of <span> tags, leads to the conclusion that the output does not comply with the given description.\n\nERR"
