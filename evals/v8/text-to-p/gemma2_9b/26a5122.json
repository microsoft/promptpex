The text must be split into individual sentences and each sentence must be wrapped in a <p> tag.\n2. It must have at least three <p> tags.\n3. Each <p> tag must include at least one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags for key words and phrases.\n\nAnalyzing the given output:\n\n- The output has three <p> tags: this satisfies the requirement of having at least three <p> tags. \n- The first <p> tag contains three <strong> tags and two <em> tags. However, it contains an asterisk (*) around the word \"lazy,\" which is not enclosed in <em> tags and seems likely to be an error.\n- The second <p> tag includes one <em> tag, but no <strong> tag, violating the requirement that each <p> tag must have at least one <strong> tag.\n- The third <p> tag contains one <strong> tag and one <em> tag, satisfying the requirements for tags in an individual sentence.\n\nDue to the second <p> tag missing a required <strong> tag and the unexpected use of an asterisk in the first <p> tag, the output does not fully comply with the description.\n\nERR"
