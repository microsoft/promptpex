  "complianceText": "The chatbot output includes three sentences, each wrapped in a `<p>` tag, which satisfies the requirement of having at least three `<p>` tags. However, the output has some compliance issues. The first `<p>` tag contains a `<strong>` tag, but it uses \"**\" instead of `<em>` tags for emphasis, which does not comply with the requirement to use `<em>` tags. This is a violation of the given description that mandates the use of `<em>` tags to emphasize key words and phrases inside each `<p>` tag.\n\nThe second `<p>` tag correctly includes `<em>` tags to emphasize keywords, but it does not include a `<strong>` tag, which is required to be in each sentence wrapped by a `<p>` tag.\n\nThe third `<p>` tag includes `<em>` tags but again lacks a `<strong>` tag.\n\nTherefore, there are clear violations related to the proper use of `<strong>` and `<em>` tags according to the description provided.\n\nERR"
