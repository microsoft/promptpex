Additionally, <em> tags are used to emphasize keywords within each <p> tag, which complies with the guideline.\n\n3. **Use of Additional Tags**: There is an unexpected presence of a <u> tag within the first <p> tag. The description only mentions using <strong> and <em> tags inside <p> tags. The presence of a <u> tag is an explicit violation of this requirement, as it does not adhere to the given instructions for emphasized key words and phrases.\n\nBased on the observation, using the <u> tag is the reason for non-compliance since it deviates from the instructions provided, which focus on using only <strong> and <em> tags for emphasis. \n\nERR"
