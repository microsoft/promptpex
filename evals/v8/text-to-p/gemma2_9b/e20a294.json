Split the paragraph into individual sentences and wrap each sentence with a `<p>` tag.\n2. Ensure the output has at least three `<p>` tags.\n3. Add one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize key words and phrases within each `<p>` tag.\n\nAnalyzing the output:\n\n1. The chatbot output includes three `<p>` tags: `<p><strong>Life</strong> is <em>beautiful</em>.</p>`, `<p><strong>Mountains</strong> are <em>grand</em>.</p>`, and `<p><strong>Oceans</strong> <em>call</em>.</p>`. This complies with the requirement of having at least three `<p>` tags.\n2. Each sentence within a `<p>` tag contains exactly one `<strong>` tag, which aligns with the requirement.\n3. Each `<p>` tag contains only one `<em>` tag, which does not comply with the requirement of having multiple `<em>` tags.\n\nThe violation occurs because the chatbot output does not have multiple `<em>` tags in any `<p>` tag, as required by the description. This failure to include multiple `<em>` tags constitutes non-compliance with the specified formatting rules.\n\nDue to this non-compliance regarding the use of multiple `<em>` tags, the decision is:\n\nThe output violates the chatbot's description because it does not have multiple `<em>` tags in each `<p>` tag, as required by the instructions.\nERR"
