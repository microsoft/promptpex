  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not comply with the description because of the following reasons:\n\n1. Although each sentence is wrapped in a `<p>` tag, and there is usage of `<strong>` and `<em>` tags, the output potentially violates the requirement for \"multiple `<em>` tags\" per `<p>` tag for the first two sentences. The first two `<p>` tags have only one `<em>` tag each. The description specifies the addition of \"one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags\" inside each `<p>` tag.\n\n2. The output contains three `<p>` tags, which satisfies the requirement of at least three `<p>` tags.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the second requirement on the multiple `<em>` tags is not met for every `<p>` tag.\n\nERR"
