  "complianceText": "The evaluation of the chatbot output identifies several areas of non-compliance with the given description. \n\n1. The first requirement is that each sentence is wrapped with a `<p>` tag. The output does include three `<p>` tags, which suggests multiple sentences have been wrapped correctly. This is compliant with the requirement of having at least three `<p>` tags.\n\n2. In terms of adding `<strong>` and `<em>` tags, each `<p>` contains these elements. The first `<p>` tag incorporates a `<strong>` tag around \"Human rights\" and an `<em>` tag around \"justice.\" The second `<p>` uses `**` for \"protect\" instead of `<strong>`, which is incorrect according to the HTML requirements specified in the description. It also includes an `<em>` tag around \"vulnerable.\" The third `<p>` tag correctly uses a `<strong>` tag for \"equitable.\"\n\n3. The error in the second `<p>` regarding the use of `**protect**` instead of an HTML `<strong>` tag directly violates the HTML formatting as specified in the description.\n\nBased on these observations, although there are three `<p>` tags as required, the incorrect use of `**` for bold text in the second `<p>` tag violates the guideline to use HTML `<strong>` tags.\n\nERR"
