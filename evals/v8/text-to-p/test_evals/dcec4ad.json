I checked the input for the presence of sentences. Each sentence is correctly punctuated with a period at the end.\n2. Count the number of sentences. There are three distinct sentences in the input.\n3. Sentences' structure: Each has both a subject and a predicate, which qualifies them as valid sentences.\n\nAmple evidence confirms every rule of the input specification has been satisfied. Hence, the compliance statement should be positive.\n\nOK",
