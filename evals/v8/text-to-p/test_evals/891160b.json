Leaves fall. Rain pours.\" This input contains exactly three sentences. Each sentence is separated by a period which is the correct punctuation for ending sentences. Based on the criteria in the input specification of containing at least three sentences, the input meets this requirement.\n\n3. **Paragraph Structure**: A paragraph generally implies a set of sentences that relate to a single topic or point, and are grouped together visually with appropriate spacing. The input consists of short, simple sentences that collectively form a text and can be considered a paragraph, albeit minimalistic. The input specification does not define particular characteristics of paragraph structure other than requiring a minimum of three sentences.\n\nBased on the above observations, no violations of the input specification are detected.
