  "validityText": "The input provided is a paragraph of text consisting of three separate statements: \"Colors dance in the rainbow.\", \"Birds sing in the morning.\", and \"Wind howls at night.\". Each of these statements ends with a period and is structured in a way typical of a sentence. According to the input specification, the input must contain at least three sentences. In this case, the input meets that requirement as it presents three distinct sentences.\n\nThinking through the input specification, my evaluation confirms that the input indeed adheres to the requirement of containing at least three sentences. There are no elements of the input that contradict the rule, and thus, it complies with the specification.\n\nOK",
