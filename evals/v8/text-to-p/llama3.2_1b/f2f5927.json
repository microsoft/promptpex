  "complianceText": "The chatbot output contains three paragraphs, as required. Each paragraph is enclosed in <p> tags. The first paragraph appears to have missing closing <p> tags. Additionally, the first and last paragraphs include text surrounded by asterisks rather than enclosed in <p> tags, which suggests formatting inconsistencies since the description explicitly requires using HTML tag formatting, not markdown styles. Each paragraph contains at least one <strong> tag, fulfilling the bold emphasis requirement. There are also <em> tags present, meeting the requirement for emphasized text. However, the presence of asterisks suggests non-compliance in adhering strictly to the HTML formatting rules described.\n\nConsidering these observations, the output does not fully comply with the requirements, mainly due to the inconsistent use of non-HTML asterisks for emphasis and the potential incomplete <p> tag in the first paragraph.\n\nERR"
