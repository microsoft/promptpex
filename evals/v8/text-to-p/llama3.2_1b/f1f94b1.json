  "complianceText": "The chatbot output needs to be evaluated for compliance with the description provided. According to the description, the output should split a paragraph into individual sentences and wrap each sentence with a `<p>` tag. The output should include at least three `<p>` tags, and inside each `<p>` tag, there should be one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize key words and phrases.\n\nUpon examining the provided output:\n\n1. There are only two `<p>` tags present. The description clearly states that there should be at least three `<p>` tags. This violates the requirement for the number of `<p>` tags.\n\n2. Each `<p>` tag should contain one `<strong>` tag. The usage of standalone asterisks is not a valid HTML `<strong>` tag. HTML requires a specific tag format: `<strong>text</strong>`. The standalone '**' in this context does not satisfy the requirement for HTML `<strong>` tags. Thus, the provided `<strong>` tags in the output are empty, which violates this requirement.\n\n3. The output does not include any `<em>` tags, even though the description requires multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize key words and phrases within each `<p>` tag.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the output does not comply with the description on multiple counts, including insufficient `<p>` tags, improper use of `<strong>` tags, and missing `<em>` tags. Therefore, the decision is clear.\n\nERR"
