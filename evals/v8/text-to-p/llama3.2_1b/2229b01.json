Specifically, the tag in \"<strong>Life</-strong>\" is incorrect (\"/\" should be a backslash \"\\\"), and there is a trailing \"</em>\" without a corresponding opening \"<em>\" tag in \"<p><strong>Life</-strong> is a journey, not a destination. </em>\".\n  \n2. The description specifies that each sentence should be wrapped with a <p> tag. One of the sentences \"seasons pass.\" is not wrapped inside its own <p> tag as it appears outside the <p> tag of the preceding sentence.\n\nThese issues indicate that the output does not fully comply with the provided description.\n\nERR"
