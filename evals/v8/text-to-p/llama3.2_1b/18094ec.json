  "complianceText": "The evaluation of the chatbot output shows several compliance issues with the description provided. The description requires that each sentence of the paragraph is wrapped with a `<p>` tag. However, the output does not properly implement this formatting requirement. \n\n1. The `<p>` tags are not used correctly. The entire line `<p strong>` and `<p em bold>` are invalid HTML tag syntax. The `<p>` tag should simply wrap content. The correct syntax should use just `<p>` at the start and `</p>` at the end of each sentence or set of content.\n\n2. There is no use of `<strong>` tag in a correct manner inside each `<p>` tag. The `<strong>` tag appears incorrectly as `<p strong>` and similarly for `<em>`.\n\n3. The description requires multiple `<em>` tags, but the structure doesn't clearly use multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize key words or phrases within each sentence.\n\n4. Additionally, the structure `<p em italic>` and `<p semicolon;>` again are invalid HTML syntax and demonstrate incorrect use of the tags.\n\nFor these reasons, there is definite non-compliance as the output does not respect the required use of HTML tags as described.\n\nERR"
