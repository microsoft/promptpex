  "complianceText": "The evaluation of the chatbot output reveals discrepancies with the description provided.\n\n1. The output contains less than three `<p>` tags that correctly encapsulate entire sentences. The `<p>` tags present do not clearly enclose state-of-the-art sentences. Some tags seem to be incorrectly placed, encapsulating individual words or breaking up sentences, which is contrary to the task of wrapping each sentence within a separate `<p>` tag.\n\n2. The output mentions using `<Strong><Em>` but does not consistently adhere to the proper casing and nesting required for HTML elements, such as `<strong><em>` and `</em></strong>`. The description requires one `<strong>` tag per sentence to emphasize key words and phrases, but the current output does not conform to these standards.\n\n3. The emphasis using `<em>` tags should encompass multiple keywords and phrases. While there are attempts at emphasizing words, the improper tag usage raises issues with displaying intended emphasis as described.\n\nBased on these observations, the output does not comply with the descriptive requirements.\n\nERR"
