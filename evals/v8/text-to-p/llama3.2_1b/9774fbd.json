  "complianceText": "Upon evaluating the chatbot output, the primary requirement is to format each sentence into a <p> tag. The description mandates the inclusion of at least three <p> tags, each containing one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags. \n\n1. The output contains more than three <p> tags, indicating that the condition of at least three <p> tags is satisfied.\n\n2. However, not every <p> tag follows the requirement of containing exactly one <strong> tag. For example, the first and last <p> tags contain multiple <strong> tags.\n\n3. Furthermore, not every <p> tag appears to have multiple <em> tags. Upon closer inspection, some <p> tags like the third one contain only one <em> tag with no <strong> tag. \n\n4. The output has also shown repeated text at the end inside the <p> tags without a clear structure. The interleaving of <em> and <strong> tags also appears incorrectly or without valid context.\n\nBased on this analysis, there is non-compliance with the descriptorâ€™s requirements for clear structuring and the correct number of <strong> and <em> tags within each <p> tag.\n\nERR"
