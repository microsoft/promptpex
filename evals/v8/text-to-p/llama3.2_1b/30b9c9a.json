  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not comply with the description for several reasons:\n\n1. The description states that each sentence should be wrapped in a `<p>` tag. In the provided output, the first sentence is not enclosed in a `<p>` tag. Instead, the text begins with `<i strong >`, which is incorrect. The third sentence is also not enclosed in a `<p>` tag; it begins with `<a strong >`.\n\n2. There should be at least three `<p>` tags to comply with the guideline that each sentence should be wrapped in a `<p>` tag, and the chatbot output should have at least three `<p>` tags. In this output, there is only one pair of `<p>` tags present, which is insufficient.\n\n3. The usage of `<strong>` and `<em>` tags is incorrect:\n   - The first usage `<i strong >Ice</ strong>` includes incorrect syntax and tag usage.\n   - The second usage `<a strong >Steam</ strong>` also includes incorrect syntax and tag usage as `<a>` tags are not appropriate for this context. \n\nBased on these clear violations of the description, the output does not comply with the format and structure specified.\n\nERR"
