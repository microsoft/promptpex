  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output does not comply with the description provided due to the following reasons:\n\n1. The output does not have at least three <p> tags as required by the description. There are only two <p> tags present in the output.\n\n2. Inside the <p> tags, the requirement is to add one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags to emphasize key words and phrases. The output contains <strong> tags but lacks the use of <em> tags entirely. The description specifies that multiple <em> tags should be used.\n\nTherefore, based on these observations, the chatbot's output fails to meet the outlined requirements, leading to the conclusion of non-compliance.\n\nERR"
