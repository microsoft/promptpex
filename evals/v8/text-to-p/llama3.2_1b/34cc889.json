  "complianceText": "The output does not comply with the description in the following ways:\n\n1. According to the description, each sentence should be wrapped in a `<p>` tag. In the output, while there are three sentences wrapped in `<p>` tags, the additional segments are improperly wrapped in `<span>` tags instead. Specifically, the second and third `<span>` elements appear to contain full sentences or parts of sentences that should have been included within the `<p>` tags instead. \n\n2. The description specifies that inside each `<p>` tag, there should be one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags. The first and third `<p>` tags do not contain any `<strong>` or `<em>` tags within them. Instead, these tags are misused outside or separately from the sentences wrapped in `<p>` tags.\n\n3. The tags `<span class=\"strong\">` and `<span class=\"em\"builtin-emphasis>` are used instead of the required `<strong>` and `<em>` tags. This does not adhere to the specified tag usage as per the description.\n\nGiven these observations, there are multiple areas where the output does not comply with the chatbot's description.\n\nERR"
