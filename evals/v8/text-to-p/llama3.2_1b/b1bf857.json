According to the description, each sentence should be wrapped with a <p> tag, and inside each <p> tag, there should be one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags to emphasize key words and phrases. Upon analysis, there are several violations:\n\n1. <strong> tags are placed outside of <p> tags instead of inside them. For each sentence, the <strong> tag should be within the <p> tag according to the description.\n2. Some <em> tags are also placed outside the <p> tags. Each sentence should have multiple <em> tags inside its corresponding <p> tag.\n3. While it is not clear without the input whether all sentences have been wrapped in <p> tags or the correct use of <strong> and <em> tags in terms of key words, the structure requirement is clearly violated as tags are misplaced.\n\nDue to these reasons, the output is marked as non-compliant with the description.\n\nERR"
