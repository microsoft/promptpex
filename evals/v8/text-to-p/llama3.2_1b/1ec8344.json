  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output does not comply with the description. The issues present in the output are as follows:\n\n1. Incorrect HTML Syntax: The syntax for the <strong> and <em> tags is incorrect. It should be <strong> and <em> instead of <span strong> and <span em strong>.\n   \n2. Missing Closing Tags: In the last <p> tag, there is a missing closing <span> and <em> tag, resulting in broken HTML.\n\n3. Requirement for Multiple <em> Tags: There is a rule that states there should be multiple <em> tags to emphasize key words and phrases inside each <p> tag. This is not fulfilled, as only one instance of an <em> equivalent (incorrectly implemented as <span/em>) is present in the second sentence.\n\nThinking process:\n- Checked the structure for the presence of <p> tags: Complies, there are three <p> tags.\n- Verified the presence of at least one <strong> tag per <p>: Intent is correct but implementation is syntactically wrong (<span strong> was used instead of <strong>).\n- Assessed the requirement for multiple <em> tags per <p>: This requirement is not fully satisfied due to incorrect syntax and absence in two paragraphs.\n\nDue to these syntax errors and missed requirements, the output is marked as non-compliant.\n\nERR"
