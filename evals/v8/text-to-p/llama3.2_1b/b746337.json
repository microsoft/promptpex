  "compliance": "err",
  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not comply with the description in the following ways:\n1. The output shows more than three `<p>` tags, which is technically not a violation because the requirement is to have at least three. But, the main issue is the incorrect use of `<strong>` tags and missing emphasis across sentences which do not adhere to the requirements.\n2. In the given output, `<strong>` tags are used incorrectly. They are applied as attributes within `<p>` tags such as `<p class=\"strong\">`, which is not what the description requires. The description specifies that a `<strong>` tag should be used inside each `<p>` tag, not as a class attribute of the `<p>` tag.\n3. Moreover, the output lacks emphasis with `<em>` tags in most of the sentences; only two sentences contain `<em>` tags. The description requires multiple `<em>` tags inside each `<p>` tag to emphasize key words and phrases.\n4. Some `<p>` tags are wrapped around incomplete or broken sentences which indicates incorrect sentence splitting or structuring.\n\nDue to these violations, specifically regarding the incorrect application of `<strong>` and `<em>` tags and lacking usage across multiple sentences, the output does not comply with the description provided.\n\nERR"
