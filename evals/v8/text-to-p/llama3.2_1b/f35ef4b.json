  "complianceText": "The output provided by the chatbot does not comply with the given description for several reasons:\n\n1. The description requires that each paragraph be split into individual sentences and each sentence should be wrapped with a <p> tag. However, the content inside the <p> tags in the output is not well-formed. Ideally, each <p> tag should contain a complete sentence, but in the output, the <p> tags contain individual words (\"Colors\", \"Birds\", and \"The\"), and the rest of the sentences is outside of the <p> tags.\n\n2. The description specifies that each <p> tag should contain one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags for emphasizing key words and phrases. In the output, the <p> tags themselves do not contain any <strong> or <em> tags. Instead, these tags appear outside the <p> tags.\n\n3. The description also states that there should be at least three <p> tags. While the output does contain three <p> tags, my decision on the compliance was based on how those tags are currently being used rather than their quantity.\n\nDue to these reasons, the chatbot output does not follow the required description formatting and thus, it results in non-compliance.\n\nERR"
