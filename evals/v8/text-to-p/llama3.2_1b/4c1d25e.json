  "complianceText": "The output provided contains four `<p>` tags, which means it meets the requirement of having at least three `<p>` tags. Each `<p>` tag includes a `<strong>` tag, satisfying that requirement as well. Additionally, the output contains `<em>` tags within the `<p>` tags, adhering to the condition of adding multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize key words and phrases.\n\nHowever, the output contains a malformed `<p>` tag: `<p><strong>Leaves</strong>%27<em>whisper</em>.</p>`. The string `%27` suggests an encoding issue for an apostrophe, which might not display correctly in a browser, potentially leading to a compliance issue. HTML cannot display the tag exactly as intended without being correctly encoded.\n\nBased on the evaluation, the presence of a malformed tag constitutes non-compliance with the description, as the description implies correctly formatted HTML structure.\n\nViolation: The fourth `<p>` tag includes `%27` instead of a correctly formatted apostrophe or relevant character, which is an issue in HTML formatting.\n\nERR"
