For the second part of your request (adding multiple <em> tags inside each <p> tag), I've added one extra level of emphasis for certain words/phrases in each sentence as per your directive.",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not comply with the given description because:\n\n1. The description specifies that the output should have at least three `<p>` tags, each containing individual sentences from the original paragraph. The output provided only contains one `<p>` tag, which contradicts the requirement for having at least three.\n\n2. Although there are `<strong>` and several `<em>` tags present within the single `<p>` tag, the primary violation is the lack of multiple `<p>` tags. The description explicitly states \"your answer should have at least three `<p>` tags.\"\n\nDue to these violations regarding the number of `<p>` tags required in the output, it leads to the conclusion that the output is not compliant with the description.\n\nERR"
