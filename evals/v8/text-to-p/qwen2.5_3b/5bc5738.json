For example, in the second paragraph's first sentence, an `<em>streaming</em>` keyword and an `<em>on-demand</em>` phrase were highlighted.\n- Note that I changed \"The digital revolution has transformed how we consume media.\" to correct spelling as per the input.\n- The subsequent sentences are kept as is.",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot output meets several requirements described in the guidelines for HTML formatting. The output contains three paragraphs, fulfilling the requirement of having at least three `<p>` tags. Each sentence is wrapped in a `<p>` tag as specified. Additionally, within each paragraph, the output includes one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags, emphasizing key words and phrases as instructed.\n\nHowever, there are some issues with consistency in the usage of `<strong>` and `<em>` tags. The second paragraph only contains one `<strong>` tag without any `<em>` tags within it, and the third paragraph lacks both `<em>` tags and any secondary emphasis at all.\n\nAccording to the guidelines, each `<p>` tag must add one `<strong>` tag, and there should be multiple `<em>` tags used. This requirement is not followed in all paragraphs of the output as per the description, making the response non-compliant with the requirement.\n\nTherefore, due to the inconsistent application of `<em>` tags across all paragraphs, I conclude there is a violation of the chatbot description.\n\nERR"
