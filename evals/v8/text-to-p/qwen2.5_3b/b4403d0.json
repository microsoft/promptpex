  "complianceText": "The output provided by the chatbot does not comply with the description for several reasons:\n\n1. The description requires that the paragraph be split into individual sentences, each wrapped with a separate <p> tag. The output only includes one <p> tag that encapsulates multiple sentences, which does not adhere to the requirements.\n\n2. The description explicitly states that the answer should have at least three <p> tags. The output only contains a single <p> tag, which violates this guideline.\n\nDue to these reasons, citing the absence of multiple <p> tags and the enclosure of multiple sentences within a single <p> tag, the output does not comply with the description.\n\nERR"
