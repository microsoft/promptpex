Additionally, while there are <strong> and <em> tags inside the <p> tag, each sentence should ideally be enclosed within its own <p> tags. This requirement is not met here, as all sentences are enclosed within one <p> tag. The use of <br /> tags might suggest a distinction between sentences, but the specification clearly asks for individual <p> tags for each sentence. Therefore, the output violates the requirement of having at least three <p> tags, and sentences not being enclosed individually.\n\nERR"
