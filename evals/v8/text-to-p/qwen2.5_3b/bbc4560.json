The description specifies that every sentence should be wrapped in a <p> tag, and inside each <p> tag there must be one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags. \n\nIn the output:\n\n1. The second sentence is not properly enclosed within a <p> tag, as the <strong> tag for the word \"significant\" and part of the sentence are placed outside a <p> tag.\n2. The third sentence is split improperly with <strong> and <b><em> tags placed outside a proper <p> tag closure.\n3. The requirement to have each sentence contained fully within a <p> tag is not met in multiple instances.\n\nTherefore, the viability that the requirements for each sentence are not satisfied makes the output non-compliant with the required description outlined. \n\nERR"
