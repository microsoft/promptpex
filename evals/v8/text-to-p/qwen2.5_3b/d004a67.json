Each sentence within the <p> tags has multiple <em> tags and one <strong> tag included, which is consistent with the description's instructions to add one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags to emphasize key words and phrases.\n\nThere are no violations of the given rules, as the description focusing on the structural requirement is met: at least three <p> tags are present, and each contains the required formatting elements. Without knowledge of the input, individual sentence segmentation cannot be judged, thus compliance is determined based on observed rules.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
