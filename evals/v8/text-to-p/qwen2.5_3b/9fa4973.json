Instead, each word of the sentences is placed inside separate `<p>` tags. According to the description, each sentence should be wrapped in its own `<p>` tag, not each word. Secondly, each sentence is expected to have one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags within its respective `<p>` tag. However, the output does not follow this guideline since strong and emphasis tags are not used inside the same `<p>` tags. Thus, it fails to meet the stated requirements.\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
