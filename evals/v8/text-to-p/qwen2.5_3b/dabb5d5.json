Each sentence should be wrapped in a `<p>` tag.\n2. The output should contain at least three `<p>` tags.\n3. Each `<p>` tag should include one `<strong>` tag to emphasize key words or phrases.\n4. Each `<p>` tag should include multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize key words or phrases.\n\nUpon examining the chatbot output:\n\n- There are three `<p>` tags in the output, which meets the requirement of having at least three `<p>` tags.\n- Each `<p>` tag contains one `<strong>` tag, complying with the requirement for the `<strong>` tag.\n- Each `<p>` tag includes only one `<em>` tag, whereas the requirement is for \"multiple\" `<em>` tags inside each `<p>` tag. The use of only one `<em>` tag in each `<p>` tag does not satisfy the requirement for multiple `<em>` tags.\n\nTherefore, the violation is that each `<p>` tag should contain multiple `<em>` tags, but the output contains only one `<em>` tag per `<p>` tag.\n\nERR"
