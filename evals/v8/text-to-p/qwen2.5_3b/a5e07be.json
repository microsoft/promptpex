Each <p> tag contains at least one <strong> tag, which also includes a <em> tag in the first two paragraphs, emphasizing key parts as required. The third paragraph meets the requirements by including both <strong> and <em> tags but does not combine them; however, since the description does not specifically require combining the tags in every instance, this approach is acceptable. Thus, there is no direct violation of the given description.\n\nNo violation.\n\nOK"
