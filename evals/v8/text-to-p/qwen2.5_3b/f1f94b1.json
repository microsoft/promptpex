However, there are multiple issues with the `<em>` tags:\n\n1. The closing `<em>` tag is missing for the word \"is\" in the second sentence: `<em>i</strong>s`.\n2. The closing `<em>` tag is missing for the word \"Creativity\" in the third sentence: `<em>i</strong>sa`.\n\nThese structural issues with the `<em>` tags demonstrate a violation of the output formatting guidelines as they result in improperly nested HTML tags. The incorrect usage of HTML tags violates the guideline to add multiple `<em>` tags properly to emphasize key words and phrases within the `<p>` tags.\n\nERR"
