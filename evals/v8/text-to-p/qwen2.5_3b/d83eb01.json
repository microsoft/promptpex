Legislation is evolving to <strong><em>protect</em></strong> consumers.</p>\n```\n\nThis ensures that each sentence within the paragraph is properly enclosed in its own <p> tag, with appropriate <strong> and multiple <em> tags applied.",

  "complianceText": "Upon evaluating the chatbot output, I noticed that the output contains only a single `<p>` tag, while the description explicitly states that there should be at least three `<p>` tags. Each sentence should be wrapped in its own `<p>` tag, but instead, the entire paragraph is enclosed within a single `<p>` tag. The violation here is the failure to split the paragraph into individual sentences with each having its own `<p>` tag. \n\nFurthermore, only one `<strong>` tag per sentence requirement cannot be checked since the number of sentences is not correct due to not having the input, it is ignored. However, compliance with the condition of using multiple `<em>` tags cannot be confirmed for each separate sentence since there is not enough separate `<p>` tags. But it's worth noting that multiple `<em>` tags are used overall in the output.\n\nTherefore, the output does not comply with the chatbot description.\n\nERR"
