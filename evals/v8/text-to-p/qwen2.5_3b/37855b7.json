Each <p> tag contains a <strong> tag to emphasize a key word, which complies with the description. However, none of the <p> tags include any <em> tags to emphasize additional key words or phrases, which is a requirement stated in the description. Therefore, the chatbot's output does not fully comply with the requirement of having multiple <em> tags per <p> tag. Since this is a clear non-compliance, I shall return 'ERR'.\n\nERR"
