Each <p> tag contains one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags are included within each <p> tag to emphasize key words and phrases. This is consistent with the description that each <p> tag should contain one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags. There is no part of the description that requires checking the correctness of which words are emphasized, as that would require knowing the input. Since the output has met all the other specified requirements, I conclude that the output is compliant.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
