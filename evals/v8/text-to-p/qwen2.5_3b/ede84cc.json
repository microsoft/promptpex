Additionally, the output should contain at least three <p> tags. However, in the output provided, all three sentences are wrapped within a single <p> tag. Therefore, it does not meet the requirement of having each sentence in an individual <p> tag and also fails to produce at least three <p> tags.\n\nConstraints related to the use of <strong> and <em> tags are observed, as these tags are used within the <p> tag. However, since the main instruction regarding the <p> tags is not followed, the output is in violation of the description.\n\nERR"
