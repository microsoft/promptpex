However, there are no `<em>` tags used in any of the `<p>` tags to emphasize key words and phrases, which violates the requirement to include multiple `<em>` tags within each `<p>` tag. Since there is a lack of compliance due to the absence of `<em>` tags, this output does not fully comply with the description provided.\n\nERR"
