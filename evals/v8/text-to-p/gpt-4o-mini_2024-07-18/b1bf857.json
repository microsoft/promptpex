Each `<p>` tag contains exactly one `<strong>` tag, which complies with the instruction to add one `<strong>` tag inside each `<p>` tag. Further, each `<p>` tag also contains multiple `<em>` tags, following the guideline to emphasize key words and phrases. \n\nThere are no elements in the description that would suggest limiting the output to a particular number of `<p>` tags, therefore having more than three does not constitute a violation.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
