  "complianceText": "The chatbot output contains three `<p>` tags, which satisfies the requirement of having at least three `<p>` tags. Each `<p>` tag contains one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags, which aligns with the requirement to include one `<strong>` and multiple `<em>` tags within each `<p>` tag. Since the description does not provide specific criteria on how the emphasis should be applied or on which keywords to use for `<strong>` and `<em>` tags (and checking such criteria would require knowledge of the input), this output conforms to the guidelines provided in the description to the extent possible without the input.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
