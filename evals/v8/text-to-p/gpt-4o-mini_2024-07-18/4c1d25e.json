According to the given output, it has sentences wrapped individually in `<p>` tags, which complies with the requirement.\n\nNext, per the guidelines, the output must have at least three `<p>` tags, and the output provided contains six `<p>` tags. Hence, this requirement is fulfilled.\n\nFurthermore, within each `<p>` tag, there is a `<strong>` tag and some `<em>` tags, which also aligns with the requirement to add these tags for emphasizing key words and phrases.\n\nThus, based on direct and explicit compliance with the description, the output adheres to the guidelines related to paragraph splitting and HTML formatting using `<p>`, `<strong>`, and `<em>` tags.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
