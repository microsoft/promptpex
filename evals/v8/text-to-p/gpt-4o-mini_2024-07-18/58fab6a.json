  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output is evaluated based on the given description. The description states that the chatbot should format a paragraph of text into multiple sentences, each wrapped with a <p> tag, which it does. Further, it requires that at least three <p> tags must be present, which is satisfied as there are exactly three <p> tags visible in the output.\n\nAdditionally, the description requires that each <p> tag should contain one <strong> tag used to emphasize a key word or phrase and multiple <em> tags for additional emphasis on key words and phrases. The output adheres to this requirement as well: \n\n1. In the first <p> tag, \"Journalism\" is wrapped in a <strong> tag, while \"informs\", \"public\", and \"discourse\" are wrapped in <em> tags.\n2. In the second <p> tag, \"Investigative reporting\" is wrapped in a <strong> tag, while \"holds\", \"power\", and \"accountable\" are wrapped in <em> tags.\n3. In the third <p> tag, \"Ethical standards\" is wrapped in a <strong> tag, while \"maintain\" and \"credibility\" are wrapped in <em> tags.\n\nEach sentence includes one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags, following the guideline specification. There are no rules requiring checking for the correctness of these sentences based on the unknown input.\n\nTherefore, the output fully complies with the described requirements.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
