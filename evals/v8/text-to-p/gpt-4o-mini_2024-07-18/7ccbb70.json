There are three `<p>` tags, which meets the requirement of having at least three `<p>` tags.\n\n2. Inside each `<p>` tag, there is one `<strong>` tag used to emphasize a key word or phrase, which adheres to the description's requirement.\n\n3. Each `<p>` tag contains multiple `<em>` tags, which are used to emphasize key words and phrases, as described.\n\nAll elements of the output align with the requirements stated in the description. No part of the evaluation relies on the input, so compliance is based on the structure and use of tags.\n\nOK"
