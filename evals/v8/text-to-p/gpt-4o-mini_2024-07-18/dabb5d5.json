  "complianceText": "The chatbot output contains six `<p>` tags, which satisfies the requirement of having at least three `<p>` tags. Each sentence is wrapped in its own `<p>` tag, as required. Inside each `<p>` tag, there is one `<strong>` tag used to emphasize key words, and there are multiple `<em>` tags, further highlighting different parts of the sentences. Although some sentences appear to be repeated, repetition is not a constraint or consideration for compliance based on the given description. Therefore, the output meets all the requirements laid out in the chatbot's description without relying on input-dependent checks.\n\nOK"
