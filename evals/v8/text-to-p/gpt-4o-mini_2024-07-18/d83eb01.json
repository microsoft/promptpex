  "complianceText": "The chatbot output contains three `<p>` tags, each with a `<strong>` tag emphasizing some key text. Additionally, within each `<p>` tag, there are one or more `<em>` tags used to emphasize individual words or phrases. This aligns with the description requirement to format a paragraph of text as HTML by splitting it into individual sentences wrapped in `<p>` tags, and incorporating at least one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags within each `<p>` tag. Since there are exactly three `<p>` tags present, it also meets the stipulation to have at least three `<p>` tags. No apparent rule from the description is violated by the output.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
