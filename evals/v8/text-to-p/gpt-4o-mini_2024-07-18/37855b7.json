The description requirements are fulfilled because:\n\n1. There are multiple `<p>` tags (at least three are required, and there are six present), demonstrating that the paragraph is split into individual sentences with each sentence wrapped in a `<p>` tag.\n2. Inside each `<p>` tag, there is exactly one `<strong>` tag, fulfilling the requirement to add a strong emphasis on a key word.\n3. Each `<p>` tag also contains `<em>` tags to emphasize key words, satisfying the inclusion of multiple `<em>` tags for key words and phrases in each `<p>` tag.\n\nConsidering these points, the output complies with the description provided.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
