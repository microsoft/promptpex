Additionally, each <p> tag includes a <strong> tag and at least one <em> tag, adhering to the task of emphasizing key words and phrases within the sentences.\n\nThe repetition of the same sentences and structure across the tags does not violate the chatbot's task description, as it does not specify that sentences need to be unique or that such repetition is not allowed.\n\nSince the output meets the minimum requirement of having at least three <p> tags with each tag containing both <strong> and <em> tags, there is no identified violation of the task description based on the output alone.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
