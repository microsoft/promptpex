  "complianceText": "The description states that each individual sentence should be wrapped with a `<p>` tag. In the provided output, there are six `<p>` tags, which implies that at least three `<p>` tags requirement is met. Each of these `<p>` tags contains a `<strong>` tag, as well as multiple `<em>` tags, which means the requirement to add one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize key words and phrases inside each `<p>` tag is fulfilled. Based on these observations, I conclude that the chatbot's output complies with the given description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
