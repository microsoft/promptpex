Night deepens.,"To evaluate whether this input complies with the specification, let's refer to the specification rule: ""The input must contain at least three sentences.""

Now evaluating the given input:
- Sentence 1: ""Moon rises high.""
- Sentence 2: ""Stars shimmer.""
- Sentence 3: ""Night deepens.""

Here is my thinking and reasoning process:
1. I checked the input for the presence of sentences. Each sentence is correctly punctuated with a period at the end.
2. Count the number of sentences. There are three distinct sentences in the input.
3. Sentences' structure: Each has both a subject and a predicate, which qualifies them as valid sentences.

Ample evidence confirms every rule of the input specification has been satisfied. Hence, the compliance statement should be positive.

1. ""The cat jumps high.""
2. ""The dog barks loud.""
3. ""The bird flies far.""

According to the input specification, the requirement is that the input must be a paragraph of text containing at least three sentences. 

Upon evaluating the input:
- It clearly forms a paragraph as it is continuous text without any excessive breaks or unrelated content between sentences.
- It satisfies the requirement of containing at least three sentences. There are precisely three sentences present in the input as listed above.

Since the input satisfies both aspects of the input specification (being a paragraph and containing at least three sentences), there is no violation of the input specification.

Therefore, based on the compliance of the input with the input specification, the decision is:

OK",ok,"```html
