The input is a string representing the abstract of a machine learning paper.  
The input must contain text that is typically found in academic paper abstracts.  
The input may include model names, technical terms, and references to methods or techniques.  
The length of the input is not explicitly restricted, but it should be within a reasonable range typical for abstracts.
