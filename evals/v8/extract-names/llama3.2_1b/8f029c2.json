However, the output provided starts with an introductory phrase \"After analyzing the given abstracts, the potential model names are:\", which is not in accordance with the response format outlined in the description. The output must consist solely of an array of model names in the format [\"model_name\"], without any additional text. Therefore, this violates the specified output format requirement.\n\nERR"
