  "complianceText": "The evaluation for compliance should be based exclusively on whether the output follows the specified format, where if model names are present, they should be in an array format like [\"model_name\"]. In this case, the output provides an array [\"MaintAI\"], which follows the required format specified in the description. There is no information about whether \"MaintAI\" exists in the input, but since there is no way to evaluate this aspect without knowing the input, it is irrelevant for this evaluation. The format compliance thus meets the requirements. Therefore, the output is compliant with the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
