However, the square brackets used are not in the correct format as specified in the guidelines which state that the output should be an array of model names in the format `[\"model_name\"]`. The output should have been provided inside quotation marks as a string within an array. Additionally, the message asking for more information if the provided output is not what the user wanted is unnecessary according to the guidelines provided, as it introduces additional instructions not described in the task. The correct format and structure were not followed, resulting in non-compliance with the given guidelines.\n\nERR"
