If there is no mention of a model, the model name is also returned as [\"NA\"]. \n\nHere's an example:\n\nAbstract: Introducing new techniques for natural language processing (NLP) in [ industry ] to solve problems with big data.\nIn this case:\nThe extracted model name is [\"NA\"] because it could be any model that enhances NLP capabilities, not PhraseFinder specifically.",

If the model name is not found or if it is uncertain, it should return [\"NA\"]. The provided output goes beyond this requirement by including an explanation of the conditions under which \"PhraseFinder\" is identified as a model name or why [\"NA\"] might be returned. Additionally, the example included at the end is unnecessary according to the task description. The output should be strictly the array without any additional explanations or examples, to align with the format requirement.\n\nERR"
