There might be a redundancy with the same model name being listed twice, but based on the compliance checks that do not require knowing the input, the output seems to follow the basic structure required by the description. Given that we are not checking for the correctness of model names due to lack of input, it does not violate the expected format of presenting model names.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
