This format directly complies with the description, which specifies that the response should be an array of model names in the format [\"model_name\"]. Since the description does not provide any criteria for evaluating the correctness of the extracted model names without the abstract input, I am restricted to verifying compliance with the structure and instructions provided. \n\nNo violation.\nOK"
