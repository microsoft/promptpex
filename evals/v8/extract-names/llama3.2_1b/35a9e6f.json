  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output is: `[\"SVM+\", ] [\"SVM+\"][\"Text Classification Under Constrained Resources\"]`. \n\nUpon examining the output, I observed the following issues:\n\n1. The output is not a single array of model names. According to the description, the response should be an array, which indicates a need for a single list in a consistent format. Here, the output is split into separate elements, failing to align with the required format.\n\n2. There is a syntax problem in the output. There are commas followed immediately by brackets, making the output format inconsistent, as seen in the second instance: `[\"SVM+\", ] [\"SVM+\"][\"Text Classification Under Constrained Resources\"]`. An array should contain elements properly separated by commas and enclosed within a single pair of brackets.\n\nThese issues demonstrate that the chatbot's output does not comply with the description provided because of format violations.\n\nERR"
