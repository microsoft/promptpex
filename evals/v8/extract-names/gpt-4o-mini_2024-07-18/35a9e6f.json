  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is an array of model names: [\"SVM+\", \"SVM\"]. According to the description, the output should be in the format [\"model_name\"] or return [\"NA\"] if no model names are found or if it is uncertain. The provided output does adhere to the format by presenting an array with what appears to be two model names. The description does not explicitly limit the number of model names nor does it prohibit similarity in names as long as they are correctly formatted as a list. Therefore, even without knowing the input, the output complies with the description available for evaluation.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
