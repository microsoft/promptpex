In this output, an array of model names [\"InceptionV3\", \"ResNext\"] is provided. The format complies with the required format [\\\"model_name\\\"]. Since compliance checking does not include verifying if these are actual model names present in the abstract (since we do not have the input), the output does comply with the description.\n\nNo violation. \nOK"
