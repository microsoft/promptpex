If no model names are found or if there is uncertainty, the response should be [\"NA\"]. The output provided by the chatbot is [\"Transformer-X\"]. This output is in the correct format, as it is an array containing a single model name. There are no violations of format, and there are no additional elements or indications of uncertainty (which would trigger the [\"NA\"] output). Since there is no input provided, I cannot determine if [\"Transformer-X\"] is a correct model name extraction, but compliance does not rest on correctness.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
