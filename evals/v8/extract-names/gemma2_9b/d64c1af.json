  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output [\"PhraseFinder\"] is an array consisting of a single model name, which complies with the format [\\\"model_name\\\"] as specified in the description. The additional sentence \"Let me know if you have other abstracts for me to analyze!\" is not explicitly mentioned in the description as part of the expected output, but it doesn't contradict the core requirement of providing the model name in the specified format. The primary requirement is met, so there is no violation regarding the output format concerning the model names. \n\nNo violation.\nOK"
