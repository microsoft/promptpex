The provided output complies with this requirement, as the output is indeed an array.\n\nSince I do not have the input abstract, I cannot evaluate whether these are the correct model names extracted from the abstract. However, this is outside the scope of the compliance check because it requires knowledge of the input.\n\nTherefore, the output complies with the provided description based on the visible rules. \n\nNo violation. \nOK"
