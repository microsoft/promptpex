  "complianceText": "The chatbot description specifies that the output should be an array of model names in the format `[\"model_name\"]`. The current output has more than one model name: `[\"BERT\", \"GPT-3\"]`, which does not match the described format. If there are multiple model names, the expectation is that each should be enclosed individually as a separate output, but from the description, it appears only one model name is expected or even if there are multiple names, it should follow the format of containing exactly one model name. Also, if unsure or no names were found, it should return `[\"NA\"]`. Since the format doesn't precisely comply with the description's guidelines of containing exactly one model name, it constitutes a violation. \n\nERR"
