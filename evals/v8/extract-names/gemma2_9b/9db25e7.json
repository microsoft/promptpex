This aligns with the description, which specifies that an array of model names should be returned if model names are found in the abstract. There is no way to determine if \"OptiPath\" is indeed a model name found in the given abstract without the input, but the format of the output, being an array with a string, complies with the description. There is no requirement violated based solely on the output format.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
