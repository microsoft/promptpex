This output is consistent with the requirement to return an array of model names. The guidelines specify that in the case where model names are extracted from the abstract, they should be provided in an array format which is achieved here. Whether \"InceptionV3\" and \"ResNext\" are actual model names extracted from the abstract cannot be assessed as the input is not available. The format and structure of the output comply with the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
