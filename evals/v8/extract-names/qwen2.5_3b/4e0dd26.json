However, without knowing the input, I can't say for sure whether \"ResNet\" was actually in the text or a model name was correctly extracted. Based purely on the output's format, it fits the pattern [\\\"model_name\\\"], thus complying with the description rules that do not depend on input knowledge.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
