According to the description, the chatbot should return an array of model names extracted from machine learning paper abstracts in the format [\"model_name\"]. In this case, the output format is [[\"BERT\", \"GPT-3\"]], which is not in the correct format of a single array of model names like [\"BERT\", \"GPT-3\"]. The output is instead a nested array, which is not according to the description's requirements. Therefore, there is a violation in terms of the output format.\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
