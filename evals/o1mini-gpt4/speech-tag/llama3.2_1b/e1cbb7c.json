  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output includes two parts of speech tags represented with examples. However, the description specifies that the output should return only a single part of speech tag. Each tag is supposed to correspond to the given word, not simply listing tags with examples, and also \"He\" is incorrect example of cardinal number according to standard grammar rules. Therefore, based on the description, the first violation is that there is more than one part of speech tag in the output. Additionally, the examples have been provided which is not stated as part of the required output format. As a result, the output does not comply with the given description.\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
