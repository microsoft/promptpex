However, the output raises a concern based on the description. The task requires returning only the part of speech tag. Including a preceding sentence \"The part of speech tag for the word \"possible\" is CC.\" violates the instruction to return only the tag. The expected compliance is to provide just the tag \"CC\" without any additional context or explanation. \n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
