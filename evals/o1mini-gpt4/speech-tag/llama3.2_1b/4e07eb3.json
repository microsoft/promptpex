The description clearly states that the chatbot should return only the part of speech tag for the given word. If the word doesn't match any given tags, it should return \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\". Instead, the chatbot's response seems to be about receiving or generating input rather than providing a part of speech tag.\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
