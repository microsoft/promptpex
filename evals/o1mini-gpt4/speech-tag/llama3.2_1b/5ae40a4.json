The output provided starts with \"IN:\", which seems to indicate a part of speech tag for \"They,\" but it is followed by \", will,\" which is not required by the task description. According to the description, only the part of speech tag should be returned, and any additional text is not compliant with the task requirements. Therefore, the inclusion of \", will\" in the output is unnecessary and does not align with the requirement to return just the tag.\n\nERR"
