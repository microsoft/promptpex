  "complianceText": "The chatbot output provides a part of speech tag \"IN\" along with the term \"jump\" and includes an additional sentence that suggests \"jump\" is the object pronoun in both sentences. According to the given description, the chatbot was supposed to only return the part of speech tag. However, the output includes extra information beyond just the tag. Therefore, the output violates the specification that requires only the part of speech tag to be returned without additional explanations or sentences.\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
