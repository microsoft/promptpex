The description specifies \"Return only the part of speech tag\", implying that only one tag should be returned per word. Therefore, the presence of two tags (\"VB\" and \"VBZ\") in the output violates the instruction to return only one tag. This leads to non-compliance with the task description.\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
