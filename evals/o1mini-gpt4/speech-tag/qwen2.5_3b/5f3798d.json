According to the description, the output should be a part of speech (POS) tag from the given list or specific exceptions like \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\". \"VB\" is a valid POS tag (it represents \"Verb, base form\"), and \"AE\" is not mentioned in the list or as one of the exceptions. The presence of \"AE\" is not explained in the description, indicating a violation of the guidelines since the output should only consist of a single part of speech tag or one of the exceptions.\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
