  "validityText": "To determine the compliance with the input specification, let's break down the input:\n\n1. **Sentence Compliance**: The input contains \"He writes letters,\" which appears to be a grammatically correct English sentence. It follows the subject-verb-object structure expected in simple sentences.\n\n2. **Word Compliance**: The word provided is \"writes,\" which is contained within the sentence \"He writes letters.\"\n\n3. **Single Input String**: The input consists of both the sentence and the word in a single string: \"He writes letters, writes.\"\n\n4. **No Additional Information**: There is no additional information beyond the sentence \"He writes letters\" and the word \"writes.\" The comma serves to separate the sentence from the word, which seems appropriate given the lack of further specifications regarding punctuation use in the input specification.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the input adheres to all rules outlined in the input specification. There is no violation found.\n\nOK",
