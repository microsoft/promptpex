  "validityText": "The input consists of a sentence \"The code is 123abc\" and a word \"123abc\". \n\nFirstly, examining the sentence: As per standard English grammar, \"123abc\" is not a recognized English word. English sentences do not typically comprise word-like structures starting with numbers or having such sequences positioned as words. Therefore, the sentence does not qualify as a grammatically correct English sentence according to standard rules of the language.\n\nSecondly, evaluating the word: While \"123abc\" does appear within the provided sentence, the issue lies with the specification's requirement for a grammatically correct English sentence, which the input fails to uphold.\n\nDue to the sentence not being grammatically correct, the input violates the input specification that requires a grammatically correct English sentence.\n\nERR",
