  "validityText": "Upon evaluating the given input, let's assess its compliance with the input specification:\n\n1. The input consists of a phrase: \"She is beautiful, beautiful\".\n2. According to the specification, the input must include a sentence and a word contained within that sentence. \n3. Checking if \"She is beautiful, beautiful\" forms a grammatically correct English sentence:\n   - The phrase does not follow typical grammatical patterns for English sentences due to the repetition of the word \"beautiful\" without a conjunction or clear contextual indication of intent.\n4. The target word mentioned is \"beautiful\", which exactly matches a word in the provided phrase.\n5. The input does include both the sentence and the target word within a single string, but the sentence must be grammatically correct, which this is not.\n\nConclusively, the phrase fails to meet the specification of being a grammatically correct English sentence.\n\nAs per my analysis:\n\n- The phrase lacks grammatical correctness due to the unconventional duplication of the word \"beautiful\".\n- This violates the requirement for the input to be a grammatically correct English sentence.\n\nERR",
