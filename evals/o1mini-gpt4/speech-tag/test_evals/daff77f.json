  "coverage": "RB",
  "validityText": "The input consists of \"Quickly did, quickly\". Evaluating it against the specification:\n\n1. The input must consist of a sentence and a word contained within that sentence.\n   - This input contains a comma which seems erroneous and does not form a proper English sentence.\n   \n2. The sentence must be a grammatically correct English sentence.\n   - \"Quickly did, quickly\" is not a grammatically correct English sentence. The structure is incorrect as it lacks the necessary components to form a complete sentence, such as a clear subject and predicate or coherent logical structure.\n\n3. The word must exactly match a word in the provided sentence.\n   - The word \"quickly\" does appear identically in the input string. However, since the \"sentence\" itself is not grammatically correct, this compliance is moot.\n\n4. Both the sentence and the word must be included in a single input string.\n   - The input string does contain both elements: the \"sentence\" and the \"word\".\n\n5. The input must not contain any additional information beyond the sentence and the target word.\n   - There is no evidence of additional information beyond the \"sentence\" and \"word\".\n\nConsidering these criteria, the input fails to comply with the grammatical correctness requirement for the sentence, which is a core part of the input specification.\n\nERR",
