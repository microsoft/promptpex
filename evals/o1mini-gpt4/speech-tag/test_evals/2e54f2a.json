  "validityText": "The input consists of a sentence \"A big house\" and a word \"big\". First, let's evaluate the sentence part. \"A big house\" is a grammatically correct English sentence. It makes sense and follows the English sentence structure with an article (\"A\"), an adjective (\"big\"), and a noun (\"house\").\n\nNext, we evaluate the inclusion of the word \"big\" in the sentence. The word \"big\" exactly matches a word in the provided sentence \"A big house\". Therefore, this part of the input specification is satisfied.\n\nFinally, we consider the input as a whole. The input does not contain any additional information beyond the given sentence and the target word. It adheres to the requirement of containing both the sentence and the word in a single input string.\n\nIn summary, the input satisfies all the requirements of the input specification: it contains a grammatically correct sentence, a word that exactly matches a word in the sentence, and no extraneous information. \n\nOK",
