  "validityText": "The input provided includes a sentence and a word: \"Run every morning, run\". Let's evaluate the input based on the input specification:\n\n1. The sentence must be grammatically correct: \"Run every morning, run\" could be considered an imperative sentence suggesting a command with emphasis. While it isn't a typical sentence, it might be interpreted as listing or emphasizing the action of running, which can be considered grammatically acceptable in a conversational or imperative context.\n\n2. The word must exactly match a word in the provided sentence: The word \"run\" is indeed found in the sentence provided and matches exactly.\n\n3. Both the sentence and the word must be included in a single input string, and the input must not contain any additional information beyond the sentence and the target word: The input is given in a single string, and there is no extraneous information beyond the provided sentence and word.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the input adheres to all the specifications:\n\n- The grammaticality of the sentence meets the requirements, though it is an atypical imperative form.\n- The word \"run\" is present in the sentence and matches exactly.\n- The sentence and word are presented as a single string without additional information.\n\nThere is no specific violation of the input specification.\n\nOK",
