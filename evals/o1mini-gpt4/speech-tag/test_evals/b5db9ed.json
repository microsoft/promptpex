  "validityText": "Upon evaluating the input according to the given specification, the following steps were considered:\n\n1. The input must consist of a sentence and a word contained within that sentence.\n2. The sentence must be a grammatically correct English sentence.\n3. The word must exactly match a word in the provided sentence.\n4. Both the sentence and the word must be included in a single input string.\n5. The input must not contain any additional information beyond the sentence and the target word.\n\nConsidering these points, here is the reasoning:\n\n- The input given is \"The word is unik, unik\". The sentence \"The word is unik\" appears to be a grammatically correct English sentence.\n- The target word provided is \"unik\".\n- Upon analysis, the word \"unik\" is not a recognized English word, and thus its presence in a sentence questions the grammatical correctness of said sentence. This violates rule number 2 that demands the sentence to be grammatically correct.\n- Therefore, the given input fails to comply with the specification as the sentence is not considered grammatically correct in standard English due to the non-standard word \"unik\".\n\nGiven this explanation, the decision is:\n\nERR",
