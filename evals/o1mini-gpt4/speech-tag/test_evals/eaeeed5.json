  "validityText": "Upon reviewing the input specification, the input provided must include a grammatically correct English sentence and a word contained within that sentence. The sentence in this case is \"The cat sleeps, sleeps\" and does not strictly adhere to standard grammatical rules as it contains a repetition of the word \"sleeps\" without a clear grammatical structure or conjunction, which is atypical for standard English sentences. Additionally, the input does not specify a word from the sentence separately, which is required by the specification. Thus, there is a violation of the specification as it neither constitutes a complete, grammatically correct sentence, nor includes the separate mention of a target word. \n\nERR",
