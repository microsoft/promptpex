  "validityText": "The given input needs to consist of a sentence and a word that is contained within that sentence. Here is my evaluation:\n\n1. Sentence: \"They quickly ran to catch the bus\"\n   - This is a grammatically correct English sentence.\n   \n2. Word: \"ran\"\n   - The word \"ran\" is indeed contained within the sentence \"They quickly ran to catch the bus.\"\n\n3. Input Structure:\n   - The input contains both the sentence and the word, and they are separated by a comma.\n\nThe input specification does not explicitly prohibit separating the sentence and the word by a comma, therefore this is acceptable. Furthermore, there is no additional information beyond the sentence and the word in the input string.\n\nBased on my thorough examination according to the provided specification, I find no violations.\n\nOK",
