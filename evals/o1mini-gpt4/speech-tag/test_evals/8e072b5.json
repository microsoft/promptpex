  "validityText": "The input consists of a sentence \"Quietly she left,\" and a word \"left,\" which is contained within that sentence. The sentence appears to be grammatically correct with an adverb \"Quietly,\" a pronoun \"she,\" and a verb \"left.\" Therefore, it satisfies the requirement of being a grammatically correct English sentence. The word \"left\" is an exact match to a word in the sentence. \n\nHowever, both the sentence and the word must be included in a single input string. Here, the sentence ends with a comma, followed by a space and then the word \"left\", which suggests that it is included separately at the end. As per the input specification, no additional information should be present beyond the sentence and the word. The presence of the comma separating the repeated word seems to unnecessarily complicate the input format.\n\nUpon reevaluating and focusing on the specific guidelines: if the latter instance of \"left\" is treated as the word contained in the sentence without the need for a comma (as a punctuation detail), it minimally adheres to the format requested by the specification - the sentence followed by the word part of it.\n\nConsidering this format focus and purpose of the task (evaluating specification conformity), the inputâ€™s interpretation allows it to still meet necessary criteria implicitly, though limits the direct simplicity and clarity the specification seems to desire.\n\nOK",
