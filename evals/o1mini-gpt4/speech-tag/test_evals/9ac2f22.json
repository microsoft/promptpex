  "validityText": "Upon evaluating the given input, here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The input consists of a sentence and a word. The sentence is \"The old man walked slowly,\" and the word is \"walked.\"\n\n2. The sentence appears to be a grammatically correct English sentence. It has a subject (\"The old man\") and a predicate (\"walked slowly\"), which complies with the rules of sentence construction.\n\n3. The word \"walked\" is contained within the sentence as required by the input specification.\n\n4. Both the sentence and the word are included in a single input string, and there is no additional information beyond the sentence and the target word.\n\nSince all elements of the input specification are met:\n\nNo violation.\nOK",
