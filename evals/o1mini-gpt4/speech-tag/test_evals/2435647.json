  "validityText": "Upon evaluating the input against the provided input specification, I have identified the following:\n\n1. The input specification requires the input to consist of a sentence and a word contained within that sentence. The provided input is \"Undefined word usage: xqz, xqz\", which does not form a grammatically correct English sentence. Instead, it appears to be a phrase with a colon and repetition of an undefined term \"xqz\", which might not be recognized as a word in English.\n\n2. The input specification also demands that the word provided must exactly match a word in the sentence. While \"xqz\" is repeated, its inclusion in the phrase \"Undefined word usage:\" is not part of a grammatically correct sentence, making it non-compliant as a valid sentence-word pair as per the requirement.\n\n3. The input contains the phrase \"Undefined word usage:\", which can be seen as additional information beyond a simple sentence and word as stipulated in the input specification.\n\n4. Given these points, this input does not comply with the input specification since it lacks a proper grammatical sentence, includes undefined words that may not be English, and contains additional information beyond a mere sentence and word pairing.\n\nBased on the reasoning outlined above, the input does not meet the required specification.\nERR",
