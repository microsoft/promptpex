  "validityText": "In evaluating the given input against the input specification, we can break down the process as follows:\n\n1. **Sentence Structure**: The input \"She quickly, quickly\" is evaluated to determine if it constitutes a grammatically correct English sentence. This input consists of a subject \"She\" and a repetition of the adverb \"quickly,\" but it lacks a verb to form a complete sentence. Grammatically, an English sentence requires at least a subject and a predicate (which typically includes a verb) to be considered complete. The input, therefore, does not fulfill these criteria.\n\n2. **Word Matching**: Although the word \"quickly\" is mentioned, and it matches exactly with a part of the sentence fragment, this is irrelevant since the primary condition of having a grammatically correct sentence is not satisfied.\n\n3. **Additional Information**: There is no additional information in the input beyond the sentence fragment and the word mentioned, which satisfies that part of the requirement. However, the presence of a grammatically incomplete sentence still results in non-compliance.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the input violates the requirement of containing a grammatically correct sentence as per the specified input conditions.\n\nERR",
