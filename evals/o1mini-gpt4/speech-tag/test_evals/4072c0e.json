The word \"walks\" is present in the sentence \"She walks gracefully.\"\n\n3. **Inclusion Requirement**: Both the sentence and the word are included in a single input string, which is the case here.\n\n4. **No Extra Information**: There should not be any additional information beyond the sentence and the target word. The input contains the sentence \"She walks gracefully\" and the word \"walks,\" with no additional information.\n\nGiven all of the considerations above, the input complies with the input specification as \"She walks gracefully\" is a sentence and 'walks' is a word from that sentence without any extra information. Therefore, the input is compliant.\n\nOK",
