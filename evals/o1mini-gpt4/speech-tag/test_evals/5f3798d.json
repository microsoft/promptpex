This satisfies the part of the specification that requires a grammatically correct English sentence.\n\n2. **Word Contained Within the Sentence**: The second part of the input is the word \"am\", which must be a word contained within the given sentence. In the sentence \"I am happy\", the word \"am\" is indeed present and matches exactly. This satisfies the requirement concerning the presence of the word within the sentence.\n\n3. **Single Input String**: The input appears as a single string, containing both the sentence and the specified word. There are no additional data or elements that deviate from this instruction.\n\nBy assessing each criterion laid out in the input specification, I find that each requirement is met by the provided input. Therefore, the input complies with the input specification.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",
