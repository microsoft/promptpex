  "coverage": "Unknown",
  "validityText": "The input consists of two parts: \"This is a mystery word,\" and \"blorf.\" \n\n1. **Sentence Evaluation**: The first part, \"This is a mystery word,\" is a sentence that appears grammatically structured. It includes a subject (\"This\"), a verb (\"is\"), and a complement (\"a mystery word\"). It ends with a comma, which is an uncommon, though not necessarily incorrect, way to end a standalone sentence. However, the sentence structure itself is grammatically permissible.\n\n2. **Word Evaluation**: The second part is the word \"blorf.\" To comply with the input specification, \"blorf\" must exactly match a word in the provided sentence. However, \"blorf\" does not appear anywhere in the sentence \"This is a mystery word.\"\n\n3. **Specification Compliance**: The specification requires that the input includes a sentence and a word that is exactly contained within that sentence. Since \"blorf\" does not match any part of the sentence provided, this requirement is not met.\n\nTherefore, the input does not comply with the provided input specification due to the mismatch between the word specified outside the sentence and the words contained in the sentence.\n\nERR",
