  "validityText": "The input provided is \"Random characters: 123abc, 123abc\". According to the specification, the input must include a sentence and a word within it. Upon examining the input, several issues arise:\n\n1. **Grammatical Sentence**: The input does not form a grammatically correct English sentence. \"Random characters: 123abc, 123abc\" cannot be categorized as a sentence as it lacks a subject and predicate.\n\n2. **Word Matching**: While \"123abc\" is repeated, it's not clear whether it is being used correctly as a word within a sentence, primarily because the entirety of the input doesn't constitute a sentence.\n\n3. **Extra Information**: The input seems to contain extra information like a list or formatting that is not a part of a natural sentence.\n\nConsidering these observations, the input does not meet the conditions outlined in the specificationâ€”it is not a grammatically correct sentence.\n\nERR",
