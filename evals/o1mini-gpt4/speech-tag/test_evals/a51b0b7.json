  "validityText": "To evaluate the input, we'll break down the input specification and check for compliance:\n\n1. The input must consist of a sentence and a word contained within that sentence.\n   - The input \"Green leaves, green\" consists of both a sentence and a word. \n\n2. The sentence must be a grammatically correct English sentence.\n   - \"Green leaves,\" is a phrase and not a complete sentence. A grammatically correct sentence typically contains at least a subject and a verb, and \"Green leaves,\" lacks a verb. Therefore, it fails to meet this requirement.\n\n3. The word must exactly match a word in the provided sentence.\n   - The word \"green\" is indeed found in the provided input.\n\n4. Both the sentence and the word must be included in a single input string.\n   - This requirement is satisfied as both are present within the single string \"Green leaves, green.\"\n\n5. The input must not contain any additional information beyond the sentence and the target word.\n   - The input does not contain any additional information; it only includes a sentence/phrase and a word.\n\nBased on the analysis, the input fails to meet the requirement of being a grammatically correct sentence. Therefore, it does not comply with the input specification.\n\nERR",
