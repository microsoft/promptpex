  "complianceText": "The output does not comply with the chatbot description. The description specifies that only the part of speech tag should be returned, but the output contains more than just the part of speech tag. It provides a detailed breakdown with the word and its tag, which violates the instruction of returning just the tag. Furthermore, the output fails to address the case when a word cannot be tagged with the listed tags or if it's unable to tag the word, as it includes a breakdown for multiple words, indicating it processed an entire sentence instead of just a single word.\n\nERR"
