  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is \"CD\". According to the description, the chatbot is supposed to return only the part of speech tag for a given word in a sentence or return \"Unknown\" if the word cannot be tagged with the listed tags, or \"CantAnswer\" if unable to tag the word. \"CD\" is indeed one of the part-of-speech tags listed in the description (CD stands for Cardinal number). The output adheres to the instruction of providing just the tag without any extraneous information or context. Since the compliance check involves just ensuring the format and type of output is as per instructions without needing to verify correctness against input (which is not provided), this output is compliant with the rules.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
