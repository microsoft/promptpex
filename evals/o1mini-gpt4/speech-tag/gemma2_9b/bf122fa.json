The tag \"VBP\" is included in the list of part-of-speech tags provided in the description, which indicates \"Verb, non-3rd person singular present.\" The output does not contain any additional or extraneous information, and it does not give an incorrect tag format. Since we cannot know the input sentence, we cannot evaluate the correctness of the tag. The output adheres strictly to the task's requirement of returning only a part of speech tag from the predefined list. Therefore, there is no violation of the task description. \n\nNo violation.\nOK"
