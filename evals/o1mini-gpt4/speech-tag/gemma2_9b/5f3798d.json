According to the description, the chatbot is supposed to supply only the part-of-speech tag for a given word, without any additional information or context. The output \"am - VBP\" includes two components separated by a dash: the word \"am\" and the tag \"VBP\". The proper output should only include the part-of-speech tag, \"VBP\", without including the word itself or any symbols like a dash. The inclusion of additional text beyond the tag constitutes a violation of the chatbot's description, which explicitly states to return only the tag.\n\nERR"
