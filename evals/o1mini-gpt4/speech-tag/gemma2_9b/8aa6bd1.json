According to the chatbot description, it is expected to return only a single part-of-speech tag for the given word or return \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\" if applicable. The output does not comply with the described behavior because it returns multiple tags instead of one. This violates the description's requirement to return just one tag or the specified alternative responses (Unknown or CantAnswer).\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
