The output adheres to the instruction to return an explicit tag or \"Unknown\" if the word doesn't fit any of the specified parts of speech. Since self-contained judgment is based on the form of output rather than the correct application of it without input context, the output complies with the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
