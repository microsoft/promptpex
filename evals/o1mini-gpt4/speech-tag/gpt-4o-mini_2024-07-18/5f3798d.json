The output \"VB\" is a valid part of speech tag listed in the description, representing \"Verb, base form\". The description also states that if the word cannot be tagged with the listed tags, it should return \"Unknown\" or if unable to tag, \"CantAnswer\". Since the output \"VB\" is one of the listed tags, the output complies with the description. There is no mention of incorrect use of these tags as no input is provided, so we cannot evaluate that aspect.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
