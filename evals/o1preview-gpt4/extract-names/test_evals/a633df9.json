  "validityText": "The input provided is missing the required starting phrase 'Abstract: ', which is specified as necessary in the input specification. The specification clearly states that the input must start with 'Abstract: ', followed by the abstract text. Therefore, the absence of 'Abstract: ' at the beginning of the input is a violation of the input specification. My reasoning was based on the explicit requirement outlined in the specification regarding the starting structure of the input. There is no mention in the input specification that allows for exceptions to this rule, so based solely on the provided specification, the input does not comply.\n\nERR",
