  "validityText": "The input provided begins with 'Abstract: ' exactly as specified, which satisfies the first requirement of starting with 'Abstract: '. The text that follows seems to be an abstract of a machine learning paper, as it mentions terms like NeuralNet, SmartAI, and DeepPredict, which are indicative of potential model names and relevant to machine learning. The input could be of any length, and it is mentioned in English, which adheres to the input specification. There is no specific requirement around the length or presence/absence of model names other than stating that they may or may not be present. \n\nThus, upon evaluation, there appears to be no violations of the input specification. \n\nOK",
  "validity": "ok"
