  "validityText": "The input begins with \"Abstract: \" followed by the text \"This paper reviews computational methods.\" This aligns with the requirement that the input should start with 'Abstract: ' followed by the abstract text. The text appears to be the abstract of a machine learning paper and it is in English. There are no explicit requirements in the specification regarding the presence of model names, so the absence of model names in this input does not violate any rules. The input specification does not impose any constraints on the length or content of the abstract besides being related to the topic generally implied to be machine learning. Therefore, the input meets all outlined specifications.\n\nOK",
