The text that follows is a brief description likely meant to be part of an abstract for a paper describing models DataMiner and InfoExtractor, and the term 'data processing' hints that it could relate to machine learning. The input specification allows the abstract to contain model names and requires it to be in English, which is satisfied here. There is no restriction on the length of the input, and it is in English language. \n\nNo violation.\nOK",
