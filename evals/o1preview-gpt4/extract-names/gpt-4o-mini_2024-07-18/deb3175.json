Since we don't have the input to verify whether there were model names present in the abstract, we can't evaluate the correctness of the output, but we can check for compliance. The output format is correctly an array with the value \"NA\", as specified by the description. Therefore, the output complies with the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
