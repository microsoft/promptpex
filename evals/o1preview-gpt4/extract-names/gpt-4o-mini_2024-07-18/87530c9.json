If no model names are found or if unsure, it should return [\"NA\"]. Without the input abstract, I cannot determine if \"AutoML\" is indeed a model name mentioned in the abstract. However, the format of the output complies with the requirements stipulated in the description, as it is an array with a string element that appears to be a model name. Given the available information, there is no evident violation of the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
