The output directly matches this requirement. Since we do not have the input and thus cannot determine if there actually were model names within it, there is no way to claim a violation of the compliance. The output adheres to the format required by the guideline, which is an array containing \"NA\" when model names are not found or when uncertain. \n\nNo violation.\nOK"
