According to the description, if the model names are extracted from the machine learning paper abstracts, they should be presented in an array format, which has been adhered to here. However, I don't have information on whether these model names actually appear in the abstract due to the absence of the input. Despite this, the format of the output is in compliance with the description. There is no explicit indication or requirement in the description that would render this output non-compliant based on the format or output conditions provided. Therefore, there is no violation in terms of the format, and the output can be evaluated as compliant.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
