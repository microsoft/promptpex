Since we cannot determine from the output alone if \"AIModel\" is extracted from the input as per the instructions (because the input is not provided), it is compliant with the description in terms of format. The task guidelines specifically allow me to ignore correctness since the input is not available, focusing only on compliance with the described output format. Therefore, there is no violation in terms of format.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
