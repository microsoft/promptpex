  "complianceText": "The chatbot output shows an array containing three items: [\"SmartAnalyser\", \"QuickSorter\", \"FastIndexer\"]. The format of the output, where it provides an array with model names, complies with the description that states the response should be an array of model names in the format [\"model_name\"]. There is no indication given that no model names were found or uncertainty about the input, so returning [\"NA\"] is unnecessary. Based on the output, it appears to meet the format requirement as mentioned.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
