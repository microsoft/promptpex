Since evaluating the correctness of the extracted model names requires knowing the input abstract, which has not been provided, the compliance check is solely based on the format and structure of the output. The output satisfies the format requirement by presenting the model name as an element of an array. Therefore, no violations are detected based on the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
