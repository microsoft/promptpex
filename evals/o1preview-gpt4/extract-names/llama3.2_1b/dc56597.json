The description states that the output should be an array of model names in the format [\"model_name\"]. However, the output utilizes an awkward structure \"Array([\"...\"]),\" which does not align with the prescribed format. Instead, the expected format would be a simple array structure, such as [\"CNN-1\", \"GAN-Gamma\", \"VAE-V\"]. Due to this inconsistency in output format description, it violates the description. Therefore, the output does not comply with the given guidelines.\n\nERR"
