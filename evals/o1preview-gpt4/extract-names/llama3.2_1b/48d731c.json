According to the description, the chatbot output must be an array in the format [\"model_name\"]. However, in this particular output, there are two separate arrays: ['Neural'] and ['Networks']. The description explicitly states that the response should be a single array, not multiple or separate arrays. Therefore, this output violates the required format because it provides two arrays instead of combining the model name into one single array as instructed.\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
