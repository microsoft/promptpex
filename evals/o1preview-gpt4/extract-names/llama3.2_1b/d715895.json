The chatbot's description specifies that the output should strictly be an array of model names formatted as [\"model_name\"] or [\"NA\"] if no model names are found or if it is not sure. However, the chatbot's output includes variable assignment syntax (`parsed_model_names =`) which is not part of the required output format. Additionally, it attempts to handle output printing with conditional logic and includes printing statements that are not aligned with the described output format. These programming constructs are not compliant with the simple array format requested in the description.\n\nERR"
