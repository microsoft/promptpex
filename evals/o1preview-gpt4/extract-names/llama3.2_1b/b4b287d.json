However, the output given is in the format `joint_model_names = ['AIModel']`, which does not follow the required format. The chatbot description does not mention using any prefix like `joint_model_names = ` before the listed model names. Therefore, the format directly violates the requirement.\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
