The description requires the response to be a single array containing only model names formatted as [\"model_name\"]. The output provided does not meet this format requirement as it includes text before the array and lists model names separately.\n   \n2. The output mentions \"None explicitly named,\" which indicates uncertainty or the absence of model names, but fails to comply with the description, which states that in such cases, [\"NA\"] should be returned as the response.\n\nBecause of these violations, the description's requirements are not met.\n\nERR"
