This format complies with the described task of extracting model names from machine learning paper abstracts as the format [\"model_name\"] is maintained. There is no explicit indication that the output is incorrect based on the description provided, as the description mentions either presenting model names in this format or returning [\"NA\"]. Since the task is to check for format compliance and not correctness of extracted content (which requires knowing the input), the provided output is in compliance.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
