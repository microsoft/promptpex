The model name in this case is \"DeepMind\". However, based on the description, the output format should be strictly [\"model_name\"], meaning it should be a single model name without nested square brackets. The output [[\"DeepMind\"]] contains nested square brackets, which is not compliant with the required format.\n\nThe specific violation here is the use of nested square brackets in the output, which does not conform to the expected format stated in the description. My decision is based solely on this discrepancy.\n\nERR"
