This format complies with the requirement to return an array of model names in the format [\"model_name\"]. The output is consistent with the description provided, which does not stipulate that there must be more than one name, only that the output, if model names are found, should be an array of strings. Since I do not have access to the input, I cannot evaluate the correctness of the model name itself. Therefore, based solely on format compliance, the output is described correctly.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
