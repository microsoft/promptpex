This format aligns with the description, which specifies that the response should be an array of model names formatted as [\"model_name\"]. Since no input is provided, I cannot evaluate whether \"DeepClustering\" is actually a model name from the input abstract, but that is not required in this compliance evaluation. Thus, based on the information given and the explicit compliance with the described format, there is no violation in the output.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
