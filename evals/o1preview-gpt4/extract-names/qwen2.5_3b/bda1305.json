The output indicates the model name as \"Proximal policy optimization\" enclosed in an array with an extra set of brackets, which is not compliant with the description requirement. The correct format should be a single array of model names, each name enclosed in quotes, without any additional enclosure. The double brackets suggest a nested array or an extra layer that violates the specified format of a single-level array.\n\nERR"
