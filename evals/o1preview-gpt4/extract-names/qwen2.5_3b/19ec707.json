  "complianceText": "The task requires the chatbot to provide an array of model names extracted from machine learning paper abstracts. The expected format is [\"model_name\"]. If the model names are not found or the chatbot is unsure, the response should be [\"NA\"]. The output given is [[\"NeuralGraph\"]]. \n\nThe output uses double brackets, indicating it is one level deeper as a list within a list, rather than following the specified format of a simple list [\"model_name\"]. This violates the requirement that each model name should be in the format [\"model_name\"] directly, without additional list nesting. \n\nErroneous output structure: [[\"NeuralGraph\"]] \nRequired output structure: [\"model_name\"]\n\nThe additional nesting of the list is a clear violation of the output format rule described in the task. This prompts a decision of non-compliance based on the strict adherence to the designated output format.\n\nERR"
