The response should be an array of the model names in the format [\"model_name\"]. In the case that no model name is found or if uncertain, the response should be [\"NA\"].\n\nIn the given output, the format of the response is a compliant format (an array with a string element). Whether \"AIModel\" is a correct model name or not cannot be determined without knowing the input abstract, which is beyond the scope of the evaluation based solely on compliance with the provided description. Therefore, based on the format alone, the output appears to comply with the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
