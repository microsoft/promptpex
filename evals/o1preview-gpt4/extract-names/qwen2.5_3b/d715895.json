In this case, the output given is [[\"DataMiner\", \"InfoExtractor\"]]. The format here is incorrect because the expected format is a single array containing string elements directly, without any additional nesting within arrays. Therefore, the nesting of arrays suggests that the output does not comply with the description provided, which specifies that a flat array should be returned. This indicates a violation of the format requirement.\n\nFormatting violation: Incorrect array nesting.\n\nERR"
