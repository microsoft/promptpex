  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output is provided in an array format as specified in the description, which is [\"model_name\"]. However, each individual model name extracted should be given as a single string within the array, like [\"SuperLearner\"]. The double square brackets suggest that the output is nested incorrectly, as it should not have an extra level of array. The correct format should have a single pair of square brackets, not double. Based on this issue with the output format, there is a violation of the description provided.\n\nThe violation stems from the incorrect array formatting. The description clearly states that the output should be an array of the model names in the format [\"model_name\"]. The output [[\"SuperLearner\"]] includes an additional pair of square brackets, violating the specified format.\n\nERR"
