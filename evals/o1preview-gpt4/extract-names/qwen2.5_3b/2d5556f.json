  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output consists of a nested array, [[\"ModelA\", \"ModelB\", \"ModelC\"]], instead of a flat array in the format [\"model_name\"]. The description specifies that the output should be a single-level array of model names, whereas the current output is a nested array. This deviation from the expected format constitutes a non-compliance with the description. Based on this, my decision is:\n\nThe violation stems from the multiple levels of brackets, indicating a nested array, instead of the required flat array. This detail clearly contravenes the specified format outlined in the task description. My evaluation process focused on identifying such elements of the output that do not align with the given guidelines.\n\nERR"
