The format of the response with [[\"NA\"]] includes an extra pair of square brackets, as the output should be a single array: [\"NA\"].\n\nThis output suggests that there is a violation of the chatbot description since the format does not match the required [\\\"NA\\\"] when no model names are found or when uncertain.\n\nERR"
