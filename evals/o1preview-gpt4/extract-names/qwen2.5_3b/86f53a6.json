According to the description, if the chatbot finds model names, it should format them as a single list, like [\"ModelOne\", \"ModelTwo\"], without nested brackets. The presence of nested brackets in the output, i.e., [[\"ModelOne\", \"ModelTwo\"]] instead of [\"ModelOne\", \"ModelTwo\"], indicates non-compliance with the format specified in the task description.\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
