The output should be an array enclosed in square brackets '[' and ']'.
The array should contain the model names extracted from the machine learning paper abstract.
Each model name in the array should be a string enclosed in double quotes '"'.
If multiple model names are found, they should all be included as separate string elements in the array, separated by commas ','.
If no model names are found in the abstract, or if you are unsure, the output should be an array containing the string "NA" enclosed in double quotes.
The output should contain only the array and nothing else.
There should be no additional text, explanations, or formatting outside the array.
