According to the description, the output should be in the format of an array of model names, which the output meets as it lists the model names in an array. However, without the input, we cannot check if the names are correctly extracted or relevant, but that is not required. The key point to note is that the response is formatted correctly as an array of strings, which is what's required by the description. There is no need to verify the correctness of these extracted names, just the compliance with the output format rule.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
