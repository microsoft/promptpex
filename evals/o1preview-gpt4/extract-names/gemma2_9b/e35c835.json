This format is consistent with the expected output format of model names as specified in the description. The output does not suggest any non-compliance with the description, as it neither includes elements that are not allowed nor deviates from the expected structure. Since the evaluation is based on compliance with the format and structure outlined in the description, without judging correctness due to missing input, the output adheres to the guidelines.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
