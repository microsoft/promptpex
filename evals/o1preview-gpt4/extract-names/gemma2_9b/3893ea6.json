If no model names are found or if the extraction is uncertain, the output should be [\"NA\"]. \n\nIn the given output, [\"DeepClustering\"], a model name is presented in an array format. As I am not provided with the input text (the abstract), I cannot verify whether this is accurate or should have been \"NA\". However, based on the output form and the outlined task, the format of an array with a string value corresponds correctly to the expected format in the description. There is no explicit violation of the format requirement here. \n\nGiven the rules for compliance checking without needing the input, there is no violation.\n\nOK"
