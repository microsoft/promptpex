  "output": "A lone figure stands silhouette against an increasingly stormy sky, their face hidden in shadow as heavy, brooding thunderclouds gather on the distant horizon, casting long, ominous shadows across the landscape. The air crackles with anticipation as a gust of wind whips around them, ruffling the grass and darkening the once vibrant blues to menacing purples and grays.  A golden sliver of sunlight bleeds through the clouds for a fleeting moment before being swallowed by the encroaching darkness, illuminating the figure's back in a poignant farewell glow.  The image should evoke a feeling of hushed anticipation and impending doom. \n\n\n",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not comply with the description due to the following reasons. Firstly, the output exceeds the required word limit of 80 words. Upon counting, the output contains more than 80 words, which is a violation of the description. The description specifies that each description should not exceed 80 words. Secondly, the output is crafted in multiple sentences but required to be in a single paragraph. While it does focus on subjects and characteristics, detail timing and lighting, describe the background, and convey the feeling the image should evoke, the length and structure do not meet the prescribed format of a single paragraph within 80 words.\n\nERR"
