It then details the timing and lighting (sunlit, cloudless winter day) and describes the background (footprints on a pristine white yard, glistening landscape). The description concludes by conveying the feeling the image should evoke, which is \"unadulterated joy\" and the \"simple pleasure of a carefree moment in the heart of winter\".
