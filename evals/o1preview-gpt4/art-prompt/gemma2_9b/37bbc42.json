  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is a single paragraph with a focus on setting detail, such as the newsroom, lighting, and atmosphere, as well as the background details like journalists at work and clocks displaying different time zones. It also effectively conveys the energic and intense feeling of a breaking news cycle. However, the output exceeds the 80-word limit. While it's descriptive and captures the essence of a scene, this specific word count criterion is not met. Therefore, there is a violation of the word limit requirement.\n\nERR"
