  "output": "A skilled violinist stands bathed in the soft, golden light of dusk, his passionate fingers dancing across the strings of his instrument. Long shadows stretch across the cobblestone streets of a historic city square, where oblivious passersby continue their evening stroll. Capture this scene with an ethereal quality, highlighting the melancholy beauty inherent in the simple act of playing music amidst the hustle and bustle of urban life.  \n\n\nLet me know if you'd like to create another prompt! \n",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is largely compliant with the description, but there is an element that does not adhere strictly to the guidelines. The text does transform a user description into a detailed prompt for generating an AI photo, discussing the subject and his characteristics (the skilled violinist), the timing and lighting (soft, golden light of dusk), the background (historic city square, cobblestone streets), and the feeling the image should evoke (melancholy beauty). The prompt is crafted in English and it fits within a single paragraph, staying within the word limit of 80 words. However, the last sentence, \"Let me know if you'd like to create another prompt!\" does not belong to the image prompt. Including additional instructions or conversational phrases like this does not align with the guideline to create a single paragraph for the photo description.\n\nERR"
