  "output": "Capture the vibrant energy of a morning market scene. Focus on colorful baskets brimming with plump, ripe fruits cascading over weathered wooden stalls nestled along cobblestone streets. Drenched in the warm glow of daybreak, show shoppers engaged in lively conversations as they browse the bounty. Surround the bustling market with charming, pastel-colored shops, their windows displaying handcrafted treasures.  Aim to evoke a sense of community spirit and contagious joy through every detail. \n\n\n\nLet me know if you have another description you'd like me to transform! \n",

  "complianceText": "The output consists of a single paragraph, which is in line with the requirement to craft the description in one paragraph. The word limit is adhered to, as the description does not exceed 80 words. The description focuses on the subjects (baskets, fruits, market) and their characteristics. It also details the timing and lighting (\"morning market,\" \"warm glow of daybreak\"), describes the background (\"cobblestone streets,\" \"pastel-colored shops\"), and concludes with the feeling the image should evoke (\"sense of community spirit and contagious joy\"). However, the final sentence \"Let me know if you have another description you'd like me to transform!\" is not part of the image prompt but rather an interactive or service-oriented message, which deviates from the task of crafting a singular, detailed prompt. \n\nERR"
