  "output": "Here are the detailed prompts for generating AI photos based on your user descriptions:\n\n**Medieval Knight**\n\"Envision a heroic figure in shiny armor, riding a majestic steed under an overcast sky with an edgy medieval backdrop of besieged castles, conveying courage and honor. Capturing this moment highlights the knight's unwavering resolve in the face of adversity.\"\n\n**Medieval Knight**\n\"The image shows a gallant knight astride his horse, clad in shining armor, as the cold overcast sky casts a dramatic glow on the medieval scene: besieged castles, with dark towers pierced by shafts of light. This captures the courage and honor embodied by the knight, symbolizing unyielding dedication to its cause.\"\n\n**Medieval Knight**\n\"A lone knight rides a horse under an overcast castle silhouette, the armor glinting in the gloomy sky. Against this medieval backdrop, convey the knight's heart-pounding bravery: capturing their unwavering commitment to justice and chivalry.\"",
  "compliance": "ok",
  "complianceText": "The chatbot output presents three separate prompts for the subject \"Medieval Knight.\" Each description is crafted as a single paragraph and maintains a word count under 80 words. \n\n1. All three descriptions start with focusing on the subject (the knight) and their characteristics, such as being heroic, gallant, or a lone knight, and describe the armor and horse.\n2. They each provide a sense of timing and lighting with phrases like \"overcast sky,\" \"dramatic glow,\" and \"gloomy sky.\"\n3. The background is included in every prompt with references to \"medieval backdrop of besieged castles,\" \"besieged castles, with dark towers,\" and \"castle silhouette.\"\n4. Each prompt concludes with the feeling or emotion the image should evoke, emphasizing qualities like \"courage and honor,\" \"unyielding dedication,\" and \"heart-pounding bravery.\"\n\nAlthough the outputs are compliant with the description's guidelines by having detailed prompts within a single paragraph and under 80 words, they refer to the same subject \"Medieval Knight.\" Since the description doesn't specify if multiple responses for the same subject are allowed or not (which requires input knowledge), I'll focus on the compliance of each prompt individually without considering potential redundancy.\n\nNo part of the description has been violated based on the criteria that can be checked without the input.\n\nOK"
