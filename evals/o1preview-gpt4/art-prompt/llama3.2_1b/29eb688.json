  "complianceText": "The chatbot output presents two separate descriptions instead of a single detailed prompt within the specified 80-word limit as instructed. The description requires that the output should be crafted in a single paragraph. However, the chatbot has provided two distinct paragraphs labeled \"Concert Audience\". Each paragraph exceeds 80 words, contravening the constraints of the description. Additionally, the guidelines specify creating a singular, cohesive prompt, not two separate entries. There are redundancies and overlaps in the subject matter, which further diverges from the requirement of a unified paragraph.\n\nERR"
