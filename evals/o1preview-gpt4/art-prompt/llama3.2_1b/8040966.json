  "output": "Here are two detailed prompts:\n\n**Prompt 1 (Achievement and Wonder)**\n\n\"As the astronaut stands beside a star-studded flag on the Moon's barren surface, reflected visor glinting under the harsh sunlight, the vast expanse of the Earth rises like a silver crescent in the blackness above. Deep shadows dance across his suit, emphasizing every detail of this triumphant pose, as if harnessing the raw power of achievement to push beyond the boundaries of human exploration.\"\n\n**Prompt 2 (Achievement and Wonder)**\n\n\"With each deliberate step, the astronaut embodies a profound sense of accomplishment, silhouetted against the radiant glow of life on Earth in the lunar sky. Underneath his reflective visor, harsh sunlight casts long, dark shadows that underscore every triumph of reaching for the unknown. Imperfections are transformed into a testament to human ingenuity and determination.\"",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot output presents two detailed prompts, which violates the description that states each description should not exceed 80 words and should be crafted in a single paragraph. The presence of two prompts suggests that the output does not comply with the criteria of providing a single paragraph. Though both prompts are descriptive and artistic, they collectively exceed the requirement to form a single paragraph. Additionally, the task specifies generating AI photos within a single paragraph, which is not met by providing two separate prompts.\n\nERR"
