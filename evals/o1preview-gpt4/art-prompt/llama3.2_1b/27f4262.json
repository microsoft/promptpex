  "output": "To craft an evocative image of this serene moment, let's focus on defining the swimmer's characteristics and aesthetic. We'll imagine our subject standing atop a rocky outcropping at the shoreline, wearing a sleek, sun-reflecting swimsuit and a streamlined wetsuit underneath, with a determined expression on their face amidst the turquoise water's gentle gradient. The mountains loom behind them, shrouded in mist, their snow-capped peaks reaching for the sky like nature's own cathedral. The ambient light is soft and diffused, with sunlight filtering down from above to illuminate the swimmer at her most vulnerable yet triumphant moment.",

  "complianceText": "The output describes an AI-generated photo prompt focusing on the subject, their characteristics, timing, lighting, and background. The description emphasizes the swimmer's aesthetics and positioning, describes the environment with mountains and mist, and specifies the lighting as soft and diffused. The ending evokes a feeling of vulnerability and triumph. The description is in one paragraph and seems concise, but it's essential to count the words. Counting the words reveals it is over the 80-word limit set by the instructions. This violation of the word count requirement leads to non-compliance with the described instructions for output.\n\nERR"
