  "complianceText": "The output does not comply with the chatbot description provided. According to the description, the chatbot's task is to transform user descriptions into a single detailed prompt for generating AI photos, and ensure this prompt does not exceed 80 words and is crafted in a single paragraph. However, the output consists of six separate prompts instead of one. Each of these prompts is intended to generate a separate image. Additionally, the description mandates the transformation into a single detailed prompt, whereas the output provides multiple prompts, each focusing on similar subject matter but framed differently. This does not align with the guidance to create a singular cohesive text. Therefore, the requirements for paragraph structure and length are not met.\n\nERR"
