  "output": "Here is a detailed prompt for generating an AI photo based on your description:\n\n\"In a vast, open landscape with rolling hills and sparse trees, distant thunderclouds approach across the horizon, their dark base rapidly deepening into a swirling mass of gray and black clouds. The wind picks up, rustling the few remaining leaves and causing the branches to sway gently. The air is charged with electricity, and the sky seems to vibrate with anticipation. As the storm draws closer, the light begins to fade, casting long shadows across the landscape. The overall mood is one of foreboding and excitement.\"",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not comply with the description provided due to several reasons. Firstly, the output exceeds the specified word limit. The prompt provided is more than 80 words long, which directly violates the rule that each description should not exceed 80 words. Moreover, while the description does focus on environmental details like the landscape and weather, it does not adhere to detailing subjects and their characteristics as prioritized in the description. The output also does not begin by mentioning the subject, which is required by the description. Based on these points, the output cannot be considered compliant.\n\nERR"
