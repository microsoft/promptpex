  "output": "\"Imagine standing atop Yavapai Point near the South Rim of Arizona, with the warm golden light of a desert sunset casting a kaleidoscope of oranges, pinks, and purples across the vast expanse of the Grand Canyon. The rocky outcroppings and layered sandstone formations create a stunning mosaic of colors as they are bathed in this breathtaking scene, with the Colorado River snaking its way through the valley below, its gentle gurgling melody a poignant accompaniment to the symphony of color. Capture a moment when the light is soft and diffused, imbuing the entire scene with an otherworldly beauty that seems frozen in time.\n\nTiming: Late afternoon to early evening, just as the sun dips below the horizon, casting long shadows across the landscape.\nLighting: Soft, gentle golden light with gradual transitions from warm oranges to soft pinks; utilize layered lightscapes to create depth and atmosphere.\nBackground: Expanse of rust-hued rock formations stretching towards the distant horizon, blending seamlessly into a hazy sky ablaze with colors.\nFeeling: Capturing the tranquil essence of nature during sunset, inviting contemplation and awe in those who behold this breathtaking panorama.\"",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output does not comply with the given description. The output exceeds the word limit of 80 words, as it contains more than what's allowed. Additionally, the information about timing, lighting, background, and feeling appears to be separated into distinct sections rather than being combined into a single, cohesive paragraph, as required by the description. The chatbot description emphasizes crafting the entire prompt in one continuous paragraph, which this output fails to achieve. \n\nERR"
