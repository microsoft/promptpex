  "output": "To craft a captivating AI-generated photo of a high-speed train blurring through dreamy, misty fields set against majestic mountains in the background, consider the following prompt:\n\n\"As dawn breaks over a rolling landscape of undulating hills and whispering trees, a sleek high-speed train hurtles forward, its silver body blurring as it cuts through the gentle morning fog. Shrouded in a veil of mist, the towering mountains rise up to the train's right, their craggy peaks reaching for the sky like shards of splintery stone. The camera captures this fleeting moment, frozen in time, where modernity and tradition converge in a kaleidoscope of movement and tranquility.\"",

  "complianceText": "The evaluation of the chatbot's output based on the provided description reveals a key non-compliance with one of the guidelines. Specifically, the description exceeds the specified 80-word limit, as it is too verbose and detailed with 100 words. Additionally, the output splits the introductory reason for the prompt from the actual prompt itself into two separate parts, thus violating the requirement of crafting the prompt within a single paragraph. However, the output successfully includes details about the subjects (the high-speed train), timing (dawn), lighting (morning fog), background (mountains and hills), and the feeling to be evoked (a convergence of modernity and tradition in movement and tranquility). The primary issue is the word count and paragraph structure.\n\nERR"
