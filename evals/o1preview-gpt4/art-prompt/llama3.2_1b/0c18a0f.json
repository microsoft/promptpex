  "output": "Here are two potential prompts:\n\n**A city skyline at dusk, with lights twinkling in vibrant hues of pink and orange**: Warm golden light spills across a glittering metropolis, as the sky transforms into a kaleidoscope of colors from fiery pinks to oranges. The reflective waters of a lake or river create a subtle mirror effect, amplifying the beauty of this serene cityscape at dusk. As twilight falls, a sense of calmness gives way to evening energy, inviting the viewer's gaze deeper into the heart of this breathtaking metropolis.\n\n**A city skyline at dusk, with lights twinkling in vibrant hues of pink and orange**: Soft peach tones illuminate the majestic silhouette of a city at its most tranquil hour. A gentle warm glow emanates from towering skyscrapers, as if reflecting off the calm waters beyond. Gentle ripples on the lake's surface mimic the flickering light effects of twinkling stars, drawing the viewer's eye into this enchanting urban landscape bathed in a soft evening breeze.",

  "complianceText": "The output contains two separate prompts rather than a single detailed prompt as specified in the description. The description requires transforming user descriptions into a detailed prompt within a single paragraph, not exceeding 80 words. The output provided exceeds this word limit and splits the information into multiple paragraphs. Furthermore, it does not strictly adhere to the requirement of initially focusing on subjects and their characteristics, followed by timing and lighting, background, and then conveying the feeling. The presence of two distinct prompts violates the instruction of crafting a cohesive, singular prompt that combines all elements cohesively within one paragraph. These violations are evident through the structure and length of the chatbot's output.\n\nERR"
