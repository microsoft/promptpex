  "complianceText": "The evaluation of the chatbot's output reveals several compliance issues with the description provided. The primary purpose of the chatbot is to transform user descriptions into a single detailed prompt that does not exceed 80 words and is crafted within one paragraph. However, the output provided consists of two separate prompts. Each prompt has been broken down into multiple lines with distinct sections (Subject, Background, Feeling). This format violates the requirement for a single cohesive paragraph. Moreover, the description also specifies a single prompt rather than multiple. This separation into different headings and multiple prompts indicates a clear non-compliance with the description's stipulation of a singular prompt within 80 words.\n\nThe chatbot output did not meet the expectation to be crafted in a single paragraph and presented a single prompt. \n\nERR"
