  "output": "To transform this very short input into an evocative and detailed prompt for generating an AI photo of a contentious feline napping in warm sunlight, consider the following:\n\nThe subject is the cat (characteristic), located on a windowsill surrounded by natural light, which creates warmth (characteristic). The time refers to morning when cats are usually most active, typically around early hours. Soft, gentle lighting (characteristic) with a slight gradient from soft to medium-contrast would be ideal.\n\nThe background should evoke the feeling of a cozy and inviting window treatment - perhaps old wood textures or woven vines draped along the windowsill. Ensure that the warm sunlight is framed by clean lines of furniture and shadows add depth without overpowering the main subject.",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output contains several issues regarding compliance with the given description. Primarily, the description specifies that the prompt should not exceed 80 words, but the provided output is significantly longer. Additionally, the output is not presented as a single paragraph as required, instead, it is formatted with separate sections for subjects, timing, lighting, and background, which violates the one-paragraph rule. Furthermore, the output does not explicitly conclude by conveying the feeling the image should evoke, although it attempts to touch on this aspect while discussing the background. These reasons indicate non-compliance with the description.\n\nERR"
