  "output": "Here are the formatted prompts based on your inputs:\n\n**Prompt 1:** \n\"A skier in mid-stance, cutting through untouched fresh powder, amidst snow-capped towering peaks and lush evergreen trees bathed in brilliant sunshine. The wind whispers secrets as they pivot effortlessly down the gentle slope.\"\n\n**Prompt 2:** \n\"High above the serene landscape, a solitary skier finds freedom as they carve through undisturbed powder, sunlight dancing across snow-encrusted ridges and emerald-green forests. Unbridled exhilaration and primal mastery infuse every movement.\"\n\nIn both prompts, I aimed for an overall 80-word limit while maintaining the described characteristics, timing, lighting, and background elements. The language is designed to evoke a sense of excitement and mastery by conveying the skier's movements and connection with nature.",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot output provides two distinct prompts, which already seem to deviate from the chatbot's description of generating a single paragraph per description. According to the description, the chatbot should create only one paragraph not multiple prompts. By presenting two separate prompts, the output violates the \"single paragraph\" requirement stated in the description. Additionally, there's no indication that the entire description does not exceed the 80-word limit as required, and it should ideally focus on a single subject description. The output also includes meta-information like \"Here are the formatted prompts based on your inputs\" and \"In both prompts, I aimed for\", which are not parts of the descriptive prompt as outlined in the requirements.\n\nConsidering these points, there are non-compliances with the chatbot's description as analyzed above.\n\nERR"
