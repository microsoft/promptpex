  "output": "A warm summer night, soft moonlight casting a gentle glow on the City of Light. The Eiffel Tower, towering above the rooftops, stands as a beacon of hope and romance. Its iron latticework glows with an ethereal light, as if infused with an inner radiance. Amidst this dreamlike scene, citizens stroll hand in hand, their faces aglow with \"joie de vivre\". A soft breeze carries the sweet scent of freshly baked croissants, enticing passersby to linger. The Seine River flows serenely through the heart of Paris, its waters reflecting the tower's majesty, like a mirror to the heavens, as night whispers secrets of love and beauty to the City.",

  "complianceText": "The output exceeds 80 words and is not presented in a single paragraph, both of which are violations of the guidelines. Additionally, while there is a focus on subjects, characteristics, and background details, there isnâ€™t a specific mention or clear structure categorizing timing, lighting, and emotional evocation, though these aspects are implicitly covered. Nonetheless, the word count and lack of a singular paragraph are explicit non-compliances.\n\nERR"
