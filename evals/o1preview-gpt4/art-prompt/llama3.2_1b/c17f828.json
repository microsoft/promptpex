  "complianceText": "The chatbot output contains two prompts, which violates the chatbot's description requirement of crafting a single paragraph prompt that does not exceed 80 words. Each of the prompts seems to comply with the need to describe the subject and their characteristics, timing, lighting, background, and emotive feeling independently, but the creation of multiple distinct prompts suggests a lack of adherence to the instruction of producing outputs within a single paragraph. Furthermore, since each prompt is provided in separate paragraphs, this further indicates non-compliance with the single paragraph requirement.\n\nERR"
