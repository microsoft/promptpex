  "output": "Here are two detailed prompts based on your subjects:\n\n**Desert Landscape:** \"A sprawling sand dune field bathed in warm sunset hues, ripples emanating from the rugged surface like water's gentle lapping against a tranquil shore. Silhouetted in the distance is an emerald-green lone caravan, its dark form a stark contrast to the golden light stretching across the sky. The gentle heat of early afternoon dissipates into a kaleidoscope of warm pinks and burnt oranges.\"\n\n**Desert Landscape:** \"A majestic sweep of sand dunes undulates with rhythmic movement, their ancient, worn surfaces shrouded in intricate patterns that seem to shimmer in the hazy afterglow of a setting sun. Silhouetted in the shadows of the desert's vastness is a lone caravan disappearing into the growing darkness, its outline vanishing behind a swirling vortex of deep blues and indigo hues. The air is heavy with the scent of creosote and mesquite as day succumbs to night.\"\n\nLet me know if you need any adjustments!",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot output consists of two separate prompts, each exceeding the single-paragraph requirement stated in the description. According to the description, the chatbot should provide a singular paragraph, prompting AI photos based on user descriptions without exceeding 80 words. Additionally, the description specifies focusing on subjects, their characteristics, timing, lighting, background, and the overall feeling in one brief paragraph. In this output, the compliance with a single-paragraph format is clearly violated as there are two separate paragraphs representing two different scenes. Hence, this is a case of non-compliance.\n\nERR"
