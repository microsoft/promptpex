  "output": "Here are two detailed prompt suggestions:\n\n1. \"Imagine a stunning landscape with a kaleidoscope pattern covering the sky, complete with symmetrical flowers, swirling clouds, and radiant suns in vibrant colors. The scene should be bathed in an even, soft light that shifts from pink to blue to green as it illuminates the ever-changing background. As the eye navigates the patterns, it should feel like witnessing endless possibilities unfold before your eyes.\"\n\n2. \"Envision a mesmerizing cityscape with a kaleidoscope pattern emerging from the city streets. The scene should feature symmetrical skyscrapers, pulsing LED lights, and abstract buildings blending seamlessly into each other. As night falls, the entire urban landscape is transformed by an even, starry light that reflects off the vibrant colors, creating an intoxicating sense of fascination and endless possibilities.\"",

  "complianceText": "The output does not comply with the description. The main issue is that the output includes two separate detailed prompt suggestions when the description specifies that the result should be a single paragraph. Additionally, each description appears to exceed the 80-word limit set by the description, though it's not necessary to count the exact words; the extensive detail suggests this. Furthermore, the chatbot output should combine information about subjects and their characteristics, timing and lighting, and background into a single cohesive paragraph instead of being presented as separate suggestions. This violates the requirement to provide a singular, succinct paragraph for generating AI photos.\n\nERR"
