The description specifies that the AI-generated photo prompt must be crafted as a singular paragraph not exceeding 80 words. However, the output provided is split into multiple segments and exceeds the word limit significantly. Furthermore, the prompt must follow a specific structure - focusing on subjects and characteristics first, then detailing timing and lighting, followed by background description, and finally convey the feeling. While the output follows this structure, its violation of the paragraph and word limit requirements indicates non-compliance. \n\nERR"
