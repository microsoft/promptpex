  "output": "Here are the detailed prompts for generating AI photos:\n\n**Subject: A Dragon Flying**\n\"Moonlit, scales glisten like polished jewels as our 3D flying dragon emerges from behind the curtain of clouds, its wings spread wide in a majestic arc. Against the silhouette of a medieval castle perched precariously on a cliff's edge, the wind ruffles the windows and towers, emphasizing the sense of power and freedom.\n\n**Subject: A Dragon Flying**\n\"Moonlit night sky ablaze with soft, otherworldly hues as our dragon bursts from clouds, its wings beating fiercely in the darkness. The castle's battlements are shrouded in mist, while the drawbridge lies abandoned, allowing the creature to soar unencumbered over the windswept landscape.\n\n**Subject: A Dragon Flying**\n\"Airborne, scales glimmer with an ethereal luster as our dragon spreads its majestic wings across the star-studded sky. A medieval castle stands sentinel against the darkness, its towers and battlements like jagged silhouettes against a backdrop of twinkling constellations, imbuing the scene with a sense of enigmatic mystery.\n\nThese prompts aim to evoke the desired emotions while providing clear direction for the AI painter.

  "complianceText": "Upon evaluating the chatbot output, it is evident that there are several areas of non-compliance with the description provided. The description requires the output to be a singular paragraph of no more than 80 words. However, the chatbot output consists of multiple paragraphs, each associated with a different variation on the theme of \"A Dragon Flying.\" Moreover, each paragraph appears significantly longer than the 80-word limit. Furthermore, the instructions specify that the chatbot should focus initially on subjects and their characteristics, then address timing and lighting, followed by the background, and conclude with the emotional feeling that the image should convey. While the prompts do elaborate on these areas, the structure does not adhere to the mandated sequence and singular paragraph format. \n\nThe non-compliance issues identified are based on the requirement for a single paragraph with a maximum of 80 words, the order of content description, and deviation from the one paragraph structure. \n\nERR"
