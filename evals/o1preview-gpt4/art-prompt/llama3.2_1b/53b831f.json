  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output provides two transformed prompts for generating AI photos: \"Mandala Focus\" and \"Abstract Background.\" Each prompt is under 80 words and focuses on artistic creativity. However, the output does not comply with the description because the task requires transforming user descriptions into a single prompt crafted in a singular paragraph. The description specifies a single prompt structure that includes subjects and their characteristics, timing and lighting details, background description, and feeling evocation in one paragraph. The output provides two separate entries instead of combining subjects, lighting, background, and emotion into a single structured prompt. Additionally, there is no mention of timing in the descriptive prompts.\n\nERR"
