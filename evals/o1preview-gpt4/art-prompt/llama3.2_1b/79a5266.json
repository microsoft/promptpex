  "output": "I'm happy to help you generate an AI photo description. To start, could you tell me a bit more about the mood and atmosphere you want to create? Is it serene and peaceful, or maybe adventurous and thrilling? Perhaps think of a specific time of day or year that evokes a particular feeling - morning, afternoon, sunset, or twilight. Are there any specific colors or colors schemes you'd like the image to feature? For instance, do you prefer a warm and earthy tone or cool and blue-ish hues?\n\nAlso, could you describe what kind of mountains, rivers, trees, animals, sky, clouds, and nature you're thinking of featuring in your image? Are they lush and green, rugged and rocky, or perhaps more vibrant with flowers, leaves, or fruits? The more details you provide about these elements, the better I can tailor the description to create an AI-generated photo that meets your vision.",

  "complianceText": "The output provided by the chatbot seems to be an interaction asking the user for further information rather than transforming the user's initial description into a detailed AI photo prompt, as required by the description. The chatbot's response is in the form of multiple questions, rather than a single 80-word paragraph. The description states that the output must focus on the subjects and their characteristics, details about timing and lighting, background description, and the feeling to be evoked, all within one paragraph. The chatbotâ€™s current output does not adhere to these requirements. It also exceeds the word count with multiple interactions without forming a single paragraph. Therefore, the output does not comply with the requirements set forth in the description.\n\nERR"
