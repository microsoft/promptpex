  "input": "A cat sleeping on a sunny windowsill.",
  "coverage": "Prompt:\nCapture a serene cat with soft, fluffy fur sleeping peacefully on a sunlit windowsill. The sunlight bathes the cat in a warm, golden glow, with gentle afternoon rays streaming through the window. The background features a tranquil garden view, with lush greenery subtly blurred to focus on the cat. The image should evoke a sense of calmness and warmth, creating an idyllic and comforting atmosphere that invites quiet reflection and contentment.",
  "validityText": "The input provides a description that includes a subject (\"A cat\") and characteristics or details about the subject's state (\"sleeping\") and the setting (\"on a sunny windowsill\"). It also includes details about timing and lighting with \"sunny\" indirectly suggesting both time of day and lighting condition. The background context is vaguely conveyed by mentioning the \"windowsill\". While there is no explicit mention of emotions or feelings, the description can naturally imply a sense of peace or contentment. Thus, the input aligns with the input specification as it involves subjects, characteristics, timing, details of the setting, and offers an indirect emotional suggestion without explicitly requiring one according to the specification. Therefore, the input complies fully with the specification.\n\nOK",
