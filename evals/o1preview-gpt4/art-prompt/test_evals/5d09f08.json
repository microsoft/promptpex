It's early morning, with soft, golden sunlight casting a warm glow, filtering through the mist outside. The background reveals a blurred landscape of rolling hills and distant towns, creating a sense of movement. The image evokes a feeling of solitude and hope, capturing a moment of introspection and the promise of new beginnings.",

No explicit requirements are mentioned for the inclusion of timing, lighting, background, or emotions. As the input description includes a valid subject and part of a scene, it complies with the specification that allows inclusion of subjects and characteristics.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",
