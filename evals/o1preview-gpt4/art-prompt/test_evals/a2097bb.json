  "input": "A crowded subway station during rush hour, people moving quickly.",
  "coverage": "Prompt:\nCapture a bustling subway station during rush hour with people moving swiftly in various directions. The subjects are diverse commuters with purposeful expressions, carrying bags and wearing a range of work attire. Evening lighting casts soft glows from the overhead fixtures, illuminating the crowd's movement. The background shows tiled walls, train tracks, and advertisement posters blurred by motion. The image should evoke energy and urgency, reflecting the dynamic and fast-paced rhythm of urban life.",
  "validityText": "The input provided is \"A crowded subway station during rush hour, people moving quickly.\" Let's evaluate it against the given input specification:\n\n- The description includes a subject: \"a crowded subway station.\"\n- It involves characteristics of the subject: \"during rush hour\" provides timing, and \"people moving quickly\" describes action.\n- There is no explicit mention of lighting, but timing can imply it indirectly (rush hour typically has certain lighting conditions), which is an acceptable detail for general context.\n- There are no explicit descriptions of the background besides the general setting of a subway station, which can be considered part of the subject in this context.\n- The input does not convey specific feelings or emotions that the image should evoke.\n\nBased on these observations, the input complies with the input specification as it provides a clear description of the subject, includes characteristics and timing details, and can be reasonably inferred to touch on setting as part of the subject. The lack of explicit emotional or background details is optional as the specification does not mandate these points but allows for their inclusion if present.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",
