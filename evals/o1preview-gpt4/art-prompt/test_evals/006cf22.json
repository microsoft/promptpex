  "coverage": "Prompt:\nCapture an empty theater with rows of plush red seats and an ornate stage, showing the aftermath of a bustling show. The scene is lit with soft, ambient lighting from elegant chandeliers, casting gentle shadows and highlighting the theater's grandeur. The background features elaborate golden accents and rich, velvet curtains drawn back to reveal the now-quiet stage. The image should evoke a sense of nostalgia and tranquility, celebrating the theater's opulent beauty and the silent echoes of performances past.",
  "validityText": "The given input \"An empty theater after a show.\" includes a description of a subject (an empty theater) and a timing detail (after a show). The description does not mention specific characteristics of the theater, such as its size or layout, but it provides a clear sense of the scene being described. It does not include explicit mentions of lighting, background, or emotions; however, the phrase \"after a show\" can imply a certain quiet or reflective mood. The input complies with the specification by providing elements such as the subject and timing. There is nothing in the specification that requires all possible details (like lighting or emotions) to be present, so the absence of these elements does not constitute a violation.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",
