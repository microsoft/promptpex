  "coverage": "Prompt: A serene cat with sleek fur and bright, attentive eyes sits on a windowsill, focused intently on the lively birds flitting outside. It's an early morning scene, with soft, golden sunlight streaming through the glass, casting a warm glow on the feline and its surroundings. The background showcases a garden with lush greenery and a clear blue sky. The image evokes a sense of tranquility and the simple joys of observing nature's beauty.",
  "validityText": "The given input describes a scene involving a subject (a cat) and an activity (watching birds from a window). This aligns with the input specification, which allows for descriptions of subjects and their characteristics. While the description does not explicitly mention characteristics like timing, lighting, or background details, the lack of such descriptions does not violate the input specification. The specification does not mandate that all elements must be present, only that any present element should be within the accepted categories, which are subjects, characteristics, timing, lighting, background, and emotions. Since the subject and activity fall within these categories, the input complies with the specification.\n\nOK",
