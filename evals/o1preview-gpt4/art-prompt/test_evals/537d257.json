  "validityText": "The input is \"A parade marching down the street.\" Let's evaluate this input based on the input specification provided:\n\n1. **Subjects and their characteristics**: The input mentions a subject, \"a parade,\" which is in line with the input specification allowing for subjects.\n2. **Timing and lighting**: There is no specific mention of timing or lighting in the input. The input specification does allow for such details, but it does not require them. So, the absence of such details is acceptable.\n3. **Descriptions of the background**: The input does mention \"the street,\" which can be considered a minimal background description. The specification allows for background descriptions, but it does not mandate any specific level of detail.\n4. **Feelings or emotions**: The input does not explicitly convey any feelings or emotions. However, similar to timing and lighting, while such descriptions are allowed, they are not mandatory. The lack of this element does not violate the specification.\n\nConsidering the details within the input and the requirements specified, there is no requirement for each aspect to be present for compliance. The input provides a subject and a minimal background, which meets the basic criteria of the input specification. Therefore, no violations are detected.\n\nOK",
