The output is organized into the specified categories: Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes.\n2. Each category is presented in the order outlined in the description.\n\nHowever, there is a slight issue. For the category \"Company names,\" it uses a non-compliant term \"None mentioned.\" Instead, the description suggests using a comma-separated list. Therefore, \"None\" would be more appropriate or simply leaving it empty.\n\nThus, my evaluation considers the slight deviation in the \"Company names\" category.\n\nERR"
