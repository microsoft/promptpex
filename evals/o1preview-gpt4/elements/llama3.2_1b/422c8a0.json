  "complianceText": "The chatbot output deviates from the prescribed format outlined in the description. Specifically, the format used to list the entities is incorrect. The format '<comma_separated_list_of_entity_types>' is not adhered to. The people names section incorrectly uses a delimiter of '||-' instead of the comma separated format. Additionally, it leaves one side of the separator without an entry which is outside the format guidelines. The use of '||-' shows non-compliance because the description requires the list to use commas to separate names. Moreover, the provided description expects a single delimiter format \"Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\" and similarly for other entity types, yet the format deviates with the use of unusual separators. \n\nERR"
