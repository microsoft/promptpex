The desired format, as specified in the description, requires single comma-separated lists for each category of entities (Company names, People names, Specific topics, General themes). Instead, the output provides a bulleted list under each category.\n\nThe format of the output should have been like this for compliance:\nCompany names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\nPeople names: <comma_separated_list_of_people_names>\nSpecific topics: <comma_separated_list_of_specific_topics>\nGeneral themes: <comma_separated_list_of_general_themes>\n\nThe chatbot output deviates from the required format by not using the specified comma-separated list format for each category. This discrepancy in formatting means the output does not adhere to the precise instructions given, leading to a violation.\n\nERR"
