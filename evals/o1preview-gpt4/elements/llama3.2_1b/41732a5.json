According to the description, the output should list company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes in a comma-separated list format. The output provided does not utilize the comma-separated list format for any of the categories and instead uses bulleted lists. Additionally, the Company Names section erroneously lists \"Team\" which seems to be a generic term, not a company name. The People Names section mentions \"team\" noting it is a generic term and not a specific name, which suggests non-compliance since a generic term should not be listed as a person name. These deviations from the desired format indicate non-compliance with the specific instructions given in the chatbot description.\n\nERR"
