  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is evaluated based on the description. Firstly, it provides extracted company names incorrectly formatted as it presents the company name followed by explanations or parentheses which are not part of the required format. Similarly, for people names, the output lists \"None\" and includes additional commentary which deviates from the specified format of the description. Even though specific topics are listed, they are not comma-separated in a single line as described. Additionally, the description instructs to extract general overarching themes, but the output provides extra commentary instead of listing themes, which further diverges from the expected format.\n\nERR"
