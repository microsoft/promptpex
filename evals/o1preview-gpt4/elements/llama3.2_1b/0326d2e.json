The description specifies that the output should begin with \"Company names,\" followed by \"People names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and then \"General themes,\" each with a comma-separated list format. The output provided follows this structure. \n\nEach section of the output contains entities that could fit into these categories: the \"Company names\" section lists a company, \"People names\" includes an individual, \"Specific topics\" lists an issue related to finance, and \"General themes\" mentions broader topics related to business and technology. This matches the format and order described in the guideline.\n\nSince the evaluation should not consider the correctness or completeness of these entities without seeing the input text, and purely follows the compliance of format, there is no violation based on the information given.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
