  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is structured according to the prescribed format: it lists company names first, followed by people names, specific topics, and general themes. However, the output for \"People Names\" and \"General Themes\" sections is represented using a hyphen (\"-\"), which is inconsistent with the format described in the guidelines. The format provided is a comma-separated list, and there is an inconsistency as no list format is presented here â€” a hyphen is used instead, which is not mentioned as an acceptable placeholder for no entries. Given this non-compliance with the format, the evaluation must be 'ERR'.\n\nThe reasoning includes: \n1. The description requires a comma-separated list or the described format, not just a hyphen.\n2. The \"General Themes\" section should follow the same format as other sections, and the presence of a standalone hyphen does not comply with the formatting description.\n\nERR"
