However, the violation lies in the formatting of the \"Company names\" section. According to the description, each section must be followed by a comma-separated list. In this output, \"Company names: -\" is not using the required separator as specified, even if the list is empty, the format should still use '-||-' as seen in the other sections. Thus, despite potentially being correct functionally, it does not comply with the format requirement provided.\n\nERR"
