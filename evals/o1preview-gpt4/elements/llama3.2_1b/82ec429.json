The output format follows the required order: Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes, with each section distinctly separated. The 'Company names' section correctly lists \"None.\" However, the 'People names' section is formatted incorrectly. It has an unexpected dash \" -\" followed by \"-||-\", which deviates from the expected format `<comma_separated_list_of_people_names>`. The 'Specific topics' and 'General themes' sections are represented appropriately with comma-separated lists as required.\n\nGiven the incorrect formatting of the \"People names\" section, the output does not fully comply with the description's guidelines.\n\nERR"
