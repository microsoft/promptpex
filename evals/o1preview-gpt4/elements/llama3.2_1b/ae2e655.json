However, there is an issue with how empty sections are handled. The description requires a comma-separated list for each category, and while the chatbot correctly uses dashes (\"-\") to show no entities are present in the \"Company names\" and \"General themes\" sections, it does not follow a similar format in \"People names.\" Additionally, \"General themes\" should also use the same dash format since no themes are provided. These inconsistencies demonstrate non-compliance with the requirement of having a consistent format across all sections in the absence of data. Therefore, the output does not comply with the description.\n\nERR"
