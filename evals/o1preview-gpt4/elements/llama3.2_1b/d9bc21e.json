  "compliance": "ok",
  "complianceText": "The chatbot output needs to be evaluated for compliance based on the format and sequence described. Here's my analysis:\n\n1. **Company Names**: The list for company names is given as '-', which implies either no company names were extracted or it's a placeholder. While it complies format-wise, ideally it should reflect either a list of names or just be empty without the placeholder '-'. However, format requirement does not explicitly mention that.\n\n2. **People Names**: The output correctly uses a dash followed by a list of people names. It lists 'Beyoncé'. This complies with the format.\n\n3. **Specific Topics**: The specific topics section lists topics in a bullet point format, which aligns with the expected format. \n\n4. **General Themes**: The general themes are given as a comma-separated list, which matches the described format.\n\nAlthough the placeholder '-' in the \"Company names\" section might be a concern, based on the guidelines, it technically does not violate the format requirement since there isn't a specific prohibition against using a placeholder. The important thing is the order and general format, which is adhered to throughout the output.\n\nAfter thorough consideration, I found no explicit violations in terms of format or sequence. Therefore, the output is compliant with the description provided.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
