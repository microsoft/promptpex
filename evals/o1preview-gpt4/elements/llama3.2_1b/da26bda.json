According to the description, the output should list entity categories with a placeholder in the format \"<comma_separated_list_of_entities>\" or \"-||-\" for no entities instead of just \"None\". In the output, \"Company names: None\" should follow the \"-||-\" format as there are presumably no companies mentioned. Additionally, \"People names:\" is left empty, which also violates the rule that it should be \"-||-\" if no people names are to be listed. The \"General themes\" section also uses \"-||-\" correctly, but there's inconsistency in the format among different sections. \n\nERR"
