The output under \"Company names\" and \"People names\" should be a comma-separated list, which seems to be represented by \"- -\" incorrectly in this case.\n\n2. The \"Specific topics\" section violates the rules by including \"- -\" after the topic \"Electric vehicles\", which does not align with the requirement of providing a simple comma-separated list.\n\n3. The \"General themes\" section should also use the comma-separated list format but appears to show \"- -\" incorrectly. \n\nThe intended output format clearly requires a comma-separated list, but the output uses \"- -\" in various sections, which is inconsistent and a non-compliance with the description.\n\nERR"
