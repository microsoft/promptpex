The \"Specific topics\" category includes \"Business communication solutions,\" and the \"General themes\" category lists \"Technology and Business.\" All categories are clearly included in the right order: company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. Thus, the output is compliant with the chatbot description rules.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
