  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not fully comply with the desired format described in the chatbot's description. The format in the output does not match the required format exactly as requested. Let's analyze the violations:\n\n1. The chatbot description specifies a clear format for listing entities: \"Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\", \"People names: -||-\", \"Specific topics: -||-\", and \"General themes: -||-\". The format uses \"-||-\" to explicitly indicate an empty list.\n\n2. In the chatbot output, \"Company names: None\" and \"People names: None\" use \"None\" instead of the specified \"-||-\". This is a direct violation of the format as described.\n\n3. For \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\", instead of leaving it as \"-||-\", additional explanatory text is provided within parentheses, which does not adhere to the prescribed clear format.\n\nThese discrepancies led me to conclude that specific parts of the output violate the expected format specified in the description, as they do not directly match what was required.\n\nERR"
