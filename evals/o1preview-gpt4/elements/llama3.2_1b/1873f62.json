The format requires a comma-separated list even if there are no entities; instead of \"None,\" it should use an empty string or omit the entity category altogether if none are found. The chatbot's answer of \"None\" for Company names breaks the format specification. Similarly, \"People names: -||-\" violates the description, which requires maintaining the format for a list. The violation occurs in not adhering to the defined standard for presenting the information as required.\n\nERR"
