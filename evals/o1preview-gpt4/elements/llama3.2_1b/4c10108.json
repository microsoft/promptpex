  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is mostly in compliance with the given description in terms of structure. However, there is one issue with the output:\n\n1. The People Names section uses \"||\" instead of the specified \"<comma_separated_list_of_people_names>\". The description specifies that all sections should be separated with commas in the format provided. The output uses \"||\" only for People Names, which does not comply with the specified format instructions. \n\nFurthermore, the other sections comply with the specified format, but this single inconsistency in using \"||\" instead of a comma means the output does not fully comply.\n\nMy reasoning is based on the fact that the description clearly delineates the format for listing items within each category, and the discrepancy lies in that specific area. The output for the \"People Names\" does not adhere to the format of using a comma-separated list, leading to the conclusion of a violation based on the explicit format requirement for listing entities.\n\nERR"
