Each field should explicitly follow the format specified, i.e., named fields with a comma-separated list, or clearly state \"None\" or equivalent if not applicable.\n\n1. **Company Names:** The output states \"None mentioned.\" which adheres to the expected format.\n\n2. **People Names:** The chatbot output says \"No company officials or experts can be identified in this text.\" This differs from stating explicitly \"None\" or \"None mentioned”. It omits the expected format by including more information than is specified in the instructions.\n\n3. **Specific Topics:** The output contains \"-Operating Systems-\" which is appropriate and compliant with the format described.\n\n4. **General Themes:** \"None, as this is a simple statement without any context or further details about the growth of 'the Linux operating system'.\" This contains additional information rather than simply stating \"None.\"\n\nThe non-compliance arises in the fields \"People Names\" and \"General Themes\", as they provide explanatory details rather than simply stating \"None\" or equivalent, thus stepping outside the description’s requirement for simple, direct responses.\n\nERR"
