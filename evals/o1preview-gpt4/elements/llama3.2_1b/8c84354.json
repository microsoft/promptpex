  "complianceText": "The chatbot output somewhat follows the format outlined in the description but with some deviations. The description specifies that each category should be followed by a comma-separated list or the specific placeholder '-||-' if there are no entities to list. The output correctly uses 'None' to indicate there are no company names and people names, even though the description specifically uses '-||-' as the placeholder. For the Specific topics and General themes sections, the chatbot correctly used '-||-' as specified in the description.\n\nHowever, despite the use of 'None' instead of '-||-' for company and people names, one can argue that this is a minor formatting difference, and the intent of the output is clear.\n\nOverall, the discrepancy is slight and may not significantly detract from understanding, but strictly speaking, it does not fully comply with the format as specified.\n\nERR"
