  "complianceText": "The chatbot output complies very well in terms of formatting as per the given description. The output is structured with headings for Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes, each followed by a list presented in the described format. The outputs are clearly separated, with each category starting on a new line. There are placeholders indicating where no entries were found, such as \"None mentioned in the given text\" for People names. The lists for Specific topics and General Themes are separated by hyphens and not in a comma-separated list. However, there is a missing topic description after the hyphen under 'Specific Topics' and there is inconsistency in listing format with the other categories which might violate the described list formatting. Therefore, a minor inconsistency with the description is present, but the overall format aligns.\n\nERR"
