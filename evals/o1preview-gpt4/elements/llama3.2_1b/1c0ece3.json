According to the given description, the output should consistently follow the specified format, which it does. It looks like the output maintains the required structure:\n\n- **Company Names**: \"None\" is a valid output if there are no relevant entities, so it complies with formatting.\n- **People Names**: Uses the correct format by listing \"Bill Gates\" on a new line under \"People names,\" adhering to the description.\n- **Specific Topics**: Lists \"Global health,\" which is correctly formatted and separated on a new line.\n- **General Themes**: Lists \"Philanthropy,\" also appropriately formatted and placed.\n\nThere are no violations in the formatting or categorization given the description doesn't specify elements beyond structure. There might be concerns about correctness or content presence which requires knowing the input but those are not considered in this evaluation.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
