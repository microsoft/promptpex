  "complianceText": "The chatbot output follows the format specified in the description: \n\n- It uses the correct descriptors: \"Company names,\" \"People names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and \"General themes.\"\n- Information is organized under each category as specified, with items separated by commas when there are multiple entities (seen under \"Specific topics\").\n- It follows the correct sequence as well (Company names first, then People names, etc.).\n\nThere is a minor deviation where \"People names\" has a hyphen, but it's largely trivial and likely within reasonable bounds of what may be acceptable in terms of output format. It resolved to satisfy the format by denoting the empty state correctly.\n\nConsidering the description, the output is formatted properly, aligning with what the description requested. \n\nNo violation.\nOK"
