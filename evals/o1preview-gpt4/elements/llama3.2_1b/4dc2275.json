The output represents the format given in the provided description, however there are issues with the compliance:\n\n1. Company names: Correctly states \"None\" which complies with having no entries found.\n\n2. People names: The format specified is \"-||-\", which aligns with no entities found; however, this pattern is repeated incorrectly for specific topics. The format for people names being \"-||-\" suggests no entities are listed, reflecting the description.\n\n3. Specific topics: The output is presented as \"Inspiring speeches, -||-\". According to the description, this section should provide a comma-separated list without repeating the separator \"-||-\". The second part \"-||-\" is not needed and indicates incorrect formatting in the context of this field.\n\n4. General themes: The themes are specified, but it extends into specifics (Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.), which seems more like a specific topic rather than a general theme. According to the description, the output should list only overarching themes in this section, not specifics that should be categorized under specific topics.\n\nDue to the formatting error in \"Specific topics\" and the misplacement of specific details under \"General themes,\" the chatbot output does not fully comply with the description.\n\nERR"
