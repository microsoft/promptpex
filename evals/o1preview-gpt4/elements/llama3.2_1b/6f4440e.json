The desired format specifies that there should be sections for \"People names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and \"General themes,\" each with a comma-separated list of items, even if they are empty. However, in the output provided, the 'People names:', 'Specific topics:', and 'General themes:' fields are simply listed without indicating that they are empty by either mentioning 'None mentioned' or leaving a clear visual indicator such as '-', ',' etc. after the colon. The format should consistently indicate the absence of entities, as seen in \"Company names: None mentioned.\" There is an inconsistency in how empty fields are handled, which violates the description's requirement for formatting.\n\nERR"
