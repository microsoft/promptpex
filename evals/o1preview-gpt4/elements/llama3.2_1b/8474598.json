The elements are separated by \"-||-\" as instructed. However, there is a minor detail where \"None\" is used instead of an empty placeholder; this isn't mentioned as a format violation in the guidelines. Each section follows directly after listing the category title, with text appropriately comma-separated where applicable, considering there's only one name and topic provided.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
