  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output does not comply with the description in several ways:\n\n1. The \"People names:\" section incorrectly uses the placeholder \"-||-\", which is reserved for non-existence of any entries, however since there are some entries ('None'), it should have been used accordingly or marked as none.\n\n2. In the \"Specific topics:\" section, the output redundantly lists \"None\" twice. If there are no specific topics, it should simply state \"None\" without duplication.\n\n3. The format for each section follows the required structure outlined in the description, but the content within each is not consistently adhering to the specified guidelines due to the presence of \"None\" in both specific topics. Each section should be directly aligned, and repetition of \"None\" indicates a formatting issue.\n\nBased on these observations, the output fails to meet the description's requirements regarding format and placeholder usage. \n\nERR"
