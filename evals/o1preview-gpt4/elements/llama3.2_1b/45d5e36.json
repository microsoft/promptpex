According to the described format, all sections (Company names, People names, Specific topics, General themes) need to include a list, albeit empty if no items are found. In this output, the \"People names\" and \"Specific topics\" sections do not have items listed nor do they explicitly indicate an empty list with symbols like `-||-`. The expected output format should have been:\n\nCompany names: Facebook\nPeople names: -||-\nSpecific topics: -||-\nGeneral themes: Location, Business Structure\n\nThe actual absence of '-||-' for the empty sections implies non-compliance with the desired format.\n\nERR"
