According to the description, the chatbot is supposed to format the extracted entities in a specific way even if they are absent. It does not comply with the description because:\n\n1. The expected format is not used in the output. Even if no entities are found, the output should include all sections (Company names, People names, Specific topics, General themes) with the proper format and possibly indicate emptiness using placeholders like empty lists or similar. \n\n2. The output does not show any format resembling the specified desired format. It merely explains the absence of text without adhering to the formatting guidelines.\n\nBecause of these reasons, the chatbot's output does not comply with the provided description. \n\nERR"
