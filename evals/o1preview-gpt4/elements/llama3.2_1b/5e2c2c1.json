According to the instructions, each section—\"Company names,\" \"People names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and \"General themes\"—should be followed by a colon and, if no entities are present, should still be clearly noted, potentially with an empty placeholder. In this output, the \"People names\" section is followed by a space without denoting it explicitly. Furthermore, there is an inconsistent use of spaces before some categories as seen with \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes.\" These small inconsistencies denote a lack of adherence to the specified format.\n\nERR"
