  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output is structured correctly according to the format specified in the description, listing Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes. Each category is addressed, with explicit mentions such as \"None\" for categories without extracted entities. \n\nHowever, categories for Specific Topics and General Themes list bullet points instead of a comma-separated list, which is a minor deviation from the expected format. But importantly, the description does not specify the format for what follows the headings of 'Company names', 'People names', 'Specific topics', and 'General themes'. Therefore, listing the items as bullet points does not necessarily violate the format description explicitly provided.\n\nBased on the description, the chatbot output complies with the format where categories are clearly separated and labeled, showing no clear violations.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
