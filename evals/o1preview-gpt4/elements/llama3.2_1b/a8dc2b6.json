The output provides these entities but not all categories are formatted correctly. Specifically, the list format is not followed for the categories where no information is present; they should still be listed with placeholders or empty as specified in the desired format. \n\n1. The \"Specific topics\" field should be formatted with a placeholder or empty list, rather than a narrative explanation.\n2. The \"General themes\" should also reflect an empty list format rather than a narrative explanation.\n\nThus, while it identifies the entities, the output does not comply with the required format.\n\nERR"
