  "complianceText": "The chatbot description specifies the format in which the entities should be extracted: Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes. The output provided includes these categories as required. However, there is an inconsistency in the format for \"Company names\" and \"People names\"; these should be more consistent across the categories. The chatbot's annotation for \"Company names\" as \"None\" deviates from the format \"Company names: -||-\", which should have been used if there are none to extract. The inconsistency in category separation constitutes a violation of the guidelines provided in the description because the description implies uniformity in representing the absence of entities across all categories using \"-||-\".\n\nERR"
