  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output is missing compliance in terms of format defined in the description. It specifies how elements should be presented with comma-separated lists for each category. The output provided includes line breaks (e.g., after Oracle Corporation, \"-\") and inconsistent format across different categories (e.g., lists separated by commas vs. lines without commas). According to the described format, individual lists should appear as comma-separated values on a single line for each category. Moreover, the output appears to be deviating from the specified format structure, indicating the need for more precise adherence to layout rules.\n\nThe output should strictly follow the described format, with commas for separation, and no additional characters (like line breaks or bullet points), except in the case of lists where commas suffice.\n\nERR"
