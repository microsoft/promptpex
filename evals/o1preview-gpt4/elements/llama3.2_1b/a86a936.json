In this output, the \"Company Names\" section contains a hyphen, which is acceptable as it may indicate no companies were mentioned. However, the \"People Names\" section contains \"-%\", which is not compliant with the format. The expected format is a comma-separated list within each category, and if there are no items, a hyphen (indicating no entries) or leaving it blank may be acceptable, but a \"%\", which is not part of the description or a standard formatting mark, is incorrect. Furthermore, the sections \"Specific Topics\" and \"General Themes\" seem to comply with the description requirements.\n\nTherefore, this output violates the format rule due to the presence of an incorrect character (\"-%\") in the \"People Names\" section.\n\nERR"
