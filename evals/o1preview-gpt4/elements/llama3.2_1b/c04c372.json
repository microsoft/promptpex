According to the description, the format requires each category to be clearly identified with a comma-separated list, and they should be in the exact format:\n\n- **Company Names**: The chatbot outputs \"NA\". If there are no company names, the output should ideally be an empty string or simply no names listed after the colon, instead of putting \"NA,\" which is not specified in the desired format.\n- **People Names**: The description requires this category to be in the format \"People names: -||-\". The chatbot output instead put this symbol on the line below, rather than directly after the colon.\n- **Specific Topics**: The format for this is met with the topics listed correctly.\n- **General Themes**: The themes are also correctly formatted as a comma-separated list.\n\nSince the format is not strictly adhered to for the Company Names and People Names, and the output deviates from the specified format, it does not fully comply with the description. \n\nERR"
