  "complianceText": "The chatbot output presents a section for company names, which is correctly formatted as \"Company names: None\" since no company names were extracted. However, the section for people names is denoted by \"-||-\" which complies with the format when no people names are extracted, though it appears visually disconnected due to the lack of space after the colon. This is still compliant with the format rules given. \n\nThe output for specific topics is missing entirely and does not even list \"None\" or \"-||-\" as placeholders as expected when no specific topics are extracted. This missing part does not comply with the format specified in the description. \n\nConversely, the section for general themes is provided, but the formatting does not separate themes with commas as instructed by \"<comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\". Moreover, it repeats \"Themes\" redundantly before listing specific themes \"Betrayal, Redemption\". This redundancy is not aligned with the example format provided in the description.\n\nThe main compliance issues are the missing specific topics section and the incorrect format for general themes.\n\nERR"
