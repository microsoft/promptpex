However, the list of company names and the list of people names have format issues.\n    - The company names list is marked as \"-||\", which lacks a comma-separated list.\n    - The people names list only has one name, but it is incorrectly formatted with \"||-\" indicating more names should follow, which is not the case.\n\n2. **Additional Information**: The people names section includes \"(CEO)\" after John Smith, which is extra information not asked for in the desired format. \n\n3. **Incomplete list**: Both 'Specific topics' and 'General themes' are followed by a list, but within the notation \"-||-,\" indicating improper formatting and the potential presence of incomplete lists.\n\nGiven these points of non-compliance with the specified output format, the output format is not correctly followed per the guidelines stated in the description.\n\nERR"
