According to the description, the output should list each category in a single line with a comma-separated list of entities (where applicable). However, the people names and specific topics are listed on separate lines, which violates the specified format. Additionally, the people names section appears to attempt to extract \"The President,\" which may not directly fit the description's expectation for people names, as it seems more like a title or role rather than a clear name.\n\nERR"
