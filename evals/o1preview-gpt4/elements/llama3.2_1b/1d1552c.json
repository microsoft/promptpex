The evaluation criteria focus on the correct format and completeness of the output according to the guidelines provided in the description. Here are the observed violations:\n\n1. Missing General Themes: The output should include a list of general overarching themes, even if none were identified from the text. In such cases, it should explicitly state \"None\" instead of leaving it blank.\n\nThe output satisfies the format for company names, people names, and specific topics correctly. However, it fails to comply with the requirements for the general themes, as it is missing altogether, which is a clear deviation from the specified format.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the output does not fully meet the specified criteria in the description.\n\nERR"
