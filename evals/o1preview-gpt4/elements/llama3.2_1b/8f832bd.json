The \"People names\" field has a formatting error. It uses \"-||-\" as the separator, which is consistent with the description, but it contains an extra character within the parentheses: \"-||(John Smith|)\". The correct format should be \"-||(John Smith)\".\n\n2. The \"Specific topics\" field lists \"Bill\" alongside \"Infrastructure\". However, \"Bill\" could potentially be a person's name rather than a topic, but without explicit input or contextual information, this could either be a person or a topic, and it's not clear if this is an error.\n\nDue to the formatting issue in the \"People names\" list, the output does not fully comply with the description. \n\nERR"
