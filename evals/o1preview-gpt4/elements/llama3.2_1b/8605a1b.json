  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is supposed to follow the desired format which lists company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes in a comma separated format after each heading. In the output:\n\n1. **Company Names**: The format specified is \"Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\", but the output uses a bullet point (\"- None mentioned in the text.\") rather than directly stating \"None\" in a comma-separated list format.\n\n2. **People Names**: The output provides a dash (\"-\") instead of listing names in the required format, and there's also a bullet point which is not aligned with the format specified in the description.\n\n3. **Specific Topics** and **General Themes** sections do comply as they list items in a hyphenated list format, which is consistent with the format implied by a comma-separated list within that section as described.\n\nThe issues with Company Names and People Names sections violate the format guideline provided in the description. They do not present the information in the strict comma-separated list format as required.\n\nERR"
