  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is supposed to follow a specific format described as:\n\nCompany names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\nPeople names: -||-\nSpecific topics: -||-\nGeneral themes: -||-\n\nUpon reviewing the provided output, I've noticed a few discrepancies with the desired format:\n\n1. Structural Consistency: The format used in the output for listing categories is inconsistent. For instance, the category headings in the output do not align with the specified format. The headings are marked with asterisks (e.g., **Company Names:** Pfizer) instead of the given format (e.g., Company names: Pfizer).\n\n2. Standardized List Separator: The description specifies that lists should be comma-separated. The output does not strictly comply because it fails to present some list segments with a consistent separator, even though there might be a single item in a category. The format could mislead users about handling multiple items.\n\n3. Uniformity in Category Presentation: There is a lack of consistency, with the use of a leading hyphen in \"People names\" but a colon used in other sections. Such inconsistencies show non-compliance with the expected output format.\n\nDue to these violations related to format structure and uniformity in the presentation, the chatbot's output does not fully comply with the requirements outlined in the description.\n\nERR"
