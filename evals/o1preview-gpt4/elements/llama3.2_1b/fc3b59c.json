  "complianceText": "The chatbot output has partially complied with the described format but also made some errors. It has listed the entities under the correct categories: Company Names, People Names, Specific Topics, and General Themes. However, the format specified in the description instructs the entities to be listed in a \"comma_separated_list\" format. This means that the items should be on the same line separated by commas rather than each item or category starting on a new line. The violation is that each category starts on a new line with a bullet-like format instead of the required comma-separated format.\n\nErroneous formatting examples:\n- **Company Names:** The description requires a \"comma_separated_list\", but the name \"Facebook\" is listed on a new line instead of producing `Company Names: Facebook`.\n\nThe output does not follow the correct formatting. Therefore, based on the format requirements, the output does not comply fully with the description.\n\nERR"
