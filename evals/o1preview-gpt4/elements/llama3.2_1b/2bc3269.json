  "compliance": "ok",
  "complianceText": "The first thing to note is that the format should match the one prescribed in the description. Firstly, for \"Company names\", the chatbot correctly states \"None mentioned\" - this would be acceptable if no companies were mentioned in the input text. Secondly, for \"People names\", the output uses \"-||-\", which adheres to the format specified in the description; however, it leaves the section blank, indicating that no people names were extracted. This too should be acceptable given the correct input scenario. For \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\", the chatbot lists \"Art, New York City\" and \"Cultural institution, museums\" respectively, both of which are consistent in format and placement.\n\nAlthough I cannot verify if there were indeed no mentions of company or people names without access to the input text, the formatting of the output itself complies with the required structure and ordering.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
