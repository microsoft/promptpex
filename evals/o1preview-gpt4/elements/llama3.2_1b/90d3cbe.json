  "complianceText": "The output provided by the chatbot does not comply with the description. First, the format for listing with 'Company names:', 'People names:', 'Specific topics:', and 'General themes:' is not respected; the output instead starts with \"Company or organization:\" and continues with \"People:\" and then \"Specific topics\" without a comma-separated list format. Additionally, the annotation provided mentions there are no people names, but this is noted as \"Not mentioned,\" which contradicts the specific requested format of \"People names: -||-\" (i.e., \"People names:\"). Furthermore, the categories of 'Specific topics' and 'General themes' are labeled incorrectly: 'Festival', which should be a general theme, is labeled under 'Specific topics', while 'Music', 'Art', and 'Dance' are presented as specific types which seems inverted as they are general themes according to the format described.\n\nThese issues demonstrate a lack of conformity with the structured format demanded by the description, requiring specific categorization and precise language conventions as illustrated. \n\nERR"
