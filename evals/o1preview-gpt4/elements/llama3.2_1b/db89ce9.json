According to the description, the chatbot should extract information in the format:\n\nCompany names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\nPeople names: -||-\nSpecific topics: -||-\nGeneral themes: -||-\n\nHowever, the output provided is missing the entities' lists and it does not follow the specified order for presenting the extracted information. Additionally, the sections like \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\" are empty and do not have the designated delimiter \"-||-\" for the empty lists, as required by the description. The output seems to explain limited information extraction due to input constraints, which implies assumptions beyond mere format compliance. These serve as clear reasons for finding the output non-compliant with the explicitly stated format requirements.\n\nERR"
