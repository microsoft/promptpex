The output is formatted with these specific headings.\n\n2. **Company names**: The chatbot has provided \"None\" under Company names. Without the input text, this cannot be judged for correctness, but the format is compliant.\n\n3. **People names**: The chatbot lists \"William Shakespeare\" under People names. This follows the expected format.\n\n4. **Specific topics**: The chatbot states \"None\" with an additional comment \"(This is a statement of opinion, not an opinion with specific topics.)\". The inclusion of a rationale in parentheses might deviate slightly from the expectation of a simple list, but since it ultimately states \"None,\" it technically complies with the expected response of listing specific topics.\n\n5. **General themes**: The output provides \"-||-\" under General themes, which is compliant since it suggests no general themes were extracted.\n\nEvaluating the output solely on compliance without needing to know the input, the chatbot's output adheres to the description's specified format and requirements. No violations are evident based on the guidelines given, as the chatbot has adhered to a structured response for each category.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
