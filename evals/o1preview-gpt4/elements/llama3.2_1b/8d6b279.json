The chatbot output has \"Company names:\" listed correctly but \"None\" is given without the appropriate format of a comma-separated list. For \"People names:\", the separator -||- is used correctly, but it should list names or mention \"None\" similar to other sections. The \"Specific topics:\" and \"General themes:\" sections seem to comply with the required format. Therefore, the inconsistency in how the chatbot addresses the \"Company names\" section and the provision of names impacts compliance.\n\nERR"
