  "complianceText": "After reviewing the output, I noticed the following issues:\n\n1. **Formatting for Empty Lists:** The Company Names and People Names should ideally follow the format <comma_separated_list_of_company_names> and <comma_separated_list_of_people_names>. If no names are mentioned, it is more consistent with the format guidelines to state this in the same line following the label or use \"None\" after a colon on the same line instead of writing \"None mentioned.\"\n\n2. **Specific Topics and General Themes Format:** The format for Specific Topics and General Themes should match the pattern described in Desired Format. The output uses bullet points, which deviates from the stated format. They should instead provide a comma-separated list.\n\nThese inconsistencies with the specified format result in a non-compliance with the description provided.\n\nERR"
