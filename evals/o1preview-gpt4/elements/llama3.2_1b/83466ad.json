The output clearly lists each section: Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes, even when there are no entities to extract (like in the case of company and people names). It has followed the format correctly by using \"None mentioned\" for sections where no information is available, which matches the intent of the format to provide information (or lack thereof) clearly. Without knowing the input, it seems reasonable.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
