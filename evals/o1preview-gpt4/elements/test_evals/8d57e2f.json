The only concern here is the use of capitalization in the key 'Text'. The key should be 'text' in all lowercase to comply with the strict requirements that the specification implies. During the evaluation, I must adhere to examining if the input fits the explicit format as provided in the specification, and considering deviations as non-compliance.\n\nSince the key 'Text' does not match the required 'text', this is a violation of the specification which requires strict adherence to using the lowercase key 'text' for any compliance.\n\nERR",
