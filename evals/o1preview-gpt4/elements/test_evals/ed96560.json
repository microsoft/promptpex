According to the input specification, the chatbot expects a string of text under the key 'text'. Here, the key is capitalized as 'Text', which does not directly comply with the specification's requirement of 'text'. The specification requires adherence to the key 'text' exactly, without case differences, implying that it is case-sensitive. Therefore, there is a violation of the input specification due to the incorrect casing of the key.\n\nERR",
