The text, \"Their journey symbolizes resilience and perseverance,\" does not mention any company names, people names, specific topics, or general themes explicitly. However, the input specification does not mandate that such mentions must be present, nor does it prohibit text that doesn't include them. The specification simply states that the text \"may\" include those mentions, which implies they are optional and not a requirement. Therefore, the lack of specific mentions in this input does not constitute a violation. The provided input fits the criteria given in the input specification, as there is no explicit rule in the specification stating that mentions must be present, only that they can be. \n\nNo violation.\nOK",
