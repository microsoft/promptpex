However, even though the content itself (\"Adidas is a global corporation that designs athletic footwear.\") contains a company name, which complies with the part of the specification that allows mentions of company names, the key itself should strictly be 'text' as per the input specification. The specified structure does not allow for variations in the key name, and such adherence to structure is crucial.\n\nThis is why my decision is:\n\nERR",
