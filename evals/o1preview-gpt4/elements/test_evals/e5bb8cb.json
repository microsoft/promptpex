In this case, the key is presented as 'Text' but the required key is 'text'. \n\nThere is a case sensitivity issue with the key. The specification explicitly requests 'text', and the input uses 'Text' instead. According to the specification, there is no indication that variations in capitalization are acceptable, so the input does not comply strictly with the specification. My decision is based solely on the direct comparison of the key, as specified.\n\nTherefore, the presence of 'Text' rather than 'text' violates the input specification.\n\nERR",
