In this case, the input is provided under the key 'Text' which is case-sensitive and does not directly match the specified key 'text'. Therefore, it violates the input specification. My decision process involved checking the compliance of the input structure with the specificationâ€”specifically, verifying the presence and correctness of the key 'text'. Since the key is not an exact match, this results in non-compliance.\n\nERR",
