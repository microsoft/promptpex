The key 'Text' (with an uppercase \"T\") does not directly match the required key 'text'. This discrepancy is a violation of the input specification as the text should be provided under the exact key 'text'.\n\nBased on this analysis, the input does not comply with the input specification due to the mismatch in the key name. Therefore, the reasoning leads me to conclude a violation of the specification.\n\nERR",
