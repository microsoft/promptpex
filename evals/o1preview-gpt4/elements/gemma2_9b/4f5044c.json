While it is not necessary to have people names if none are found, the comma at the end of the \"Specific topics\" list is incorrect as it suggests a continuation when the list is actually complete. The description does not specify that incomplete lists should end with a comma. Therefore, the format for specific topics is not adhered to the guidelines as expected. Furthermore, descriptions require a strict formatting which includes not ending the list with an unnecessary comma. Based on these observations, my decision is:\n\nERR"
