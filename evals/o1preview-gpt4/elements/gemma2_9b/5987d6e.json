  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not comply with the description for several reasons. The format specifies that the lists (company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes) should be comma-separated. However, the output is missing entries for \"Company names\" and \"People names,\" indicating that the lists are empty. While it might be acceptable if there are no entities to list, the output doesn't clearly reflect compliance with the format provided. Additionally, the lists for \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\" follow a bullet point style rather than a comma-separated list as required. \n\nHence, the output does not adhere strictly to the desired format of comma-separated lists, and the presence of non-compliant list formatting means the output has a structural issue. This leads to overall non-compliance with the description guidelines.\n\nERR"
