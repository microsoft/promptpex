However, since the input is not given, this cannot be decisively concluded.\n\n2. **People names violation**: Similar to the \"Company names,\" the output lists \"People names\" but does not provide any. This might indicate missing expected people's names.\n\nGiven the above points, since the description specifies a format that includes company names and people names (even if there are none, it normally wouldn't show the category heading without providing a \"None\" or leaving the section empty), such issues indicate a procedural non-compliance with the expected structure.\n\nERR"
