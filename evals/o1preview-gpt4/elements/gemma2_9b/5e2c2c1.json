The format is consistent with the required comma-separated list.\n\n2. **People names**: This section is present but left empty. Although the presence of an empty field for people names is technically compliant since the format is followed, without input, it's unclear if there should be names present. However, format compliance is maintained.\n\n3. **Specific topics**: This section lists \"space travel, International Space Station (ISS), missions.\" The format is a comma-separated list, which is compliant.\n\n4. **General themes**: This section lists \"space exploration, technological advancement.\" The format is a comma-separated list, which is compliant.\n\nThe chatbot output adheres to the specified format in the description, with each category present and in the correct format, as far as can be judged without input.
