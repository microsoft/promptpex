  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is organized in the structure outlined in the description: \"Company names,\" \"People names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and \"General themes.\" Each category is populated with relevant information derived from the text according to the chatbot. The only deviation is in the \"People names\" section, where the placeholder \"-||-\" is used, although not specified in the description, it implies that no people names were found which is a valid way to represent that none were found. \n\nBreaking down the key parts:\n\n- **Company names:** The list includes \"Facebook,\" which matches the expected format of a comma-separated list.\n- **People names:** Uses the placeholder \"-||-\", indicating no names were found. This format is consistent with the output example in the description.\n- **Specific topics:** Mentions \"Headquarters\" and \"location (Menlo Park, California),\" fitting the category, and structured as a list.\n- **General themes:** Lists \"Technology companies\" and \"Geography\" as broad themes, meeting the format requirements.\n\nNo rules from the description are violated, as far as can be determined from the output alone without input text.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
