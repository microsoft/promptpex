The output follows the correct structure for the extraction fields, which are: Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes. The output has maintained these categories and has listed entities accordingly. In accordance with the description, it is important to separate each category with a comma-separated list for the entities. Here the output does not list company names or people names, which is acceptable because there might be none to list given that the input text is unknown. \n\nThe note-worthy part is that the specific topics mentioned are \"Academy Awards\" and \"Oscars\", while general themes are \"Award Ceremony\", \"Entertainment\", and \"Recognition\". This format complies with the description, fulfilling each category's requirements correctly and maintaining separation without any omissions in formatting.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
