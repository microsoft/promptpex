  "complianceText": "The evaluation of the chatbot's output is based on the following considerations:\n\n1. **Order and Structure Compliance**: The output provides four sections in the required order: Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes. Each section is clearly separated and labeled, following the desired format.\n\n2. **Consistency with Description**: The structure aligns with the description, as it starts with \"Company names\" followed by a list, followed by \"People names\" (though it's empty), then \"Specific topics,\" and finally \"General themes.\" Each section uses the format with a colon and provides a list, in this case, a comma-separated list for company names as required.\n\n3. **Presence of Data**: The \"People names\" section is empty, which is allowable because the format is maintained as per compliance; the section is present even if no data is extracted. The rest of the sections contain data formatted correctly.\n\nThere are no violations regarding the format or structure based on the available evaluation criteria, as the output adheres to the specified format and order within each required category.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
