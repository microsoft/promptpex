  "complianceText": "The chatbot output adheres to the format specified in the description. The output begins with the \"Company names\" section, listing \"World Trade Organization\" as expected. While there's nothing under \"People names\", the description allows for empty sections if no applicable information is given or available. The \"Specific topics\" section includes \"global trade\" and \"trade rules,\" followed by the \"General themes\" section listing \"international organizations\" and \"economics\". These sections are clearly delineated and accurately labeled, preserving the required structure outlined in the chatbot description. Therefore, there are no evident violations as per the evaluation guidelines which do not require the correctness of the specific content within each category.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
