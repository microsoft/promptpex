According to the description, the expected output format is strict, with comma-separated lists for each category.\n\nUpon evaluation, there are issues in the formatting of the output:\n\n1. **Company Names Format**: The company names \"Tesla,SpaceX\" lack a space after the comma. According to the standard format for comma-separated lists, a space should follow each comma for clarity.\n\n2. **Specific Topics Format**: The specific topics list ends with a comma, which is inconsistent with typical list formatting. There should not be a trailing comma at the end of the list.\n\nGiven these points, the output does not fully comply with the description's formatting requirements.\n\nERR"
