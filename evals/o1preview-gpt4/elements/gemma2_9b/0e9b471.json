Extracting people names as a comma-separated list.\n3. Extracting specific topics.\n4. Extracting general overarching themes.\n\nIn the provided output:\n\n- The field \"Company names\" is left blank instead of using a placeholder like \"-||-\" which is required by the format.\n- \"People names\" uses the correct placeholder \"-||-\".\n- \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\" are properly filled with information.\n\nThe key issue here is with the \"Company names\" section not using the required placeholder, which is a violation of the format rules. This leads to the conclusion that the chatbot output does not comply with the requirements as it is not strictly adhering to the desired format.\n\nERR"
