  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not comply with the description, and here's the reasoning behind this decision:\n\n1. The output does not list any actual company names, which is required after the \"Company names:\" label. The section is provided but left empty without any entries. This violates the description which specifically requires a comma-separated list of company names.\n\n2. The \"People names:\" section lists \"CEO,\" which is a title and not a person's name. The description requires a comma-separated list of people names.\n\nThe other sections (\"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\") are formatted correctly in terms of structure, but since checking correctness requires knowing the input, these will not affect the compliance decision. However, because of the issues with the \"Company names\" and \"People names\" sections, the output does not fully adhere to the required format.\n\nERR"
