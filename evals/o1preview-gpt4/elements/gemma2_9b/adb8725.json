According to the description, even if there are no company names present to extract from the text, the output should contain \"Company names: \" followed by a comma-separated list, even if it's empty. This ensures each section is addressed in the predefined format. The output should comply by at least placing an empty indicator after \"Company names: \" (potentially \"None\" or another suitable placeholder) if no company names were mentioned in the text. As this format adherence is not met, it indicates non-compliance with the description. \n\nERR"
