The format requires lists for four categories: Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes.\n\n1. **Company names**: The output does not list any company names. It leaves this section empty, which is acceptable if the text did not contain any company names.\n\n2. **People names**: The output lists \"Einstein\" under People names. This complies with the format, assuming \"Einstein\" is a correct extraction from the text.\n\n3. **Specific topics**: The output lists \"physics, theory of relativity\" under Specific topics. This adheres to the required format and is assumed to be correct.\n\n4. **General themes**: The output lists \"scientific discovery, impact on science\" under General themes. This follows the format.\n\nNo other violations in terms of format and adherence to sections are present. The output does comply with the required format since all categories are present and populated in a list form as per the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
