  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output is structured in a way that seems to align with the desired format specified in the description. The sections for company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes are present. However, based on the formatting outlined in the description, each section should contain a list separated by commas, rather than being formatted with bullet points. Additionally, for \"Company names,\" the expected format requires a comma-separated list, even if no company names are present. The actual output provides an asterisk, which does not correspond with the desired format. Therefore, considering the non-compliance in formatting, the output does not fully comply with the chatbot description.\n\nERR"
