It starts by listing company names, followed by people names, specific topics, and general themes, as described. The specific delimiter \"-||-\" is used as instructed in the description.\n\nHowever, there is a violation in the format specified. According to the description, each category must be separated with \", â€œ but people names and specific topics comply with it. People names has an empty value but instead of using the comma separated format, it is left blank. Given the description specifies a comma separated list is expected for every category and considering that an empty value would still require an explicit indication of \"none\" or similar within the provided format, the format technically deviates from the expectation. \n\nHence, a violation is detected due to the missing explicit separator format on the \"People names\" section.\n\nERR"
