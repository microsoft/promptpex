  "complianceText": "The output does not comply with the description because:\n\n1. The format for \"Company names\" and \"People names\" sections is missing the required \"<comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\" and \"<comma_separated_list_of_people_names>\" format since they appear to be left empty without any placeholder text or explanation. The description implies that both should contain text, even if it's a note like \"None\" to indicate no entities of that type were found.\n\n2. The \"Company names\" and \"People names\" sections are completely blank, whereas the desired format should have text stating that there are no entities if none were detected.\n\nThus, the output violates the format requirement in these sections.\n\nERR"
