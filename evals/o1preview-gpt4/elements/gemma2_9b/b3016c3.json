The required sections — \"Company names\", \"People names\", \"Specific topics\", and \"General themes\" — are all present in the output, which means the chatbot has complied with the structure requirement of the task. Each category is clearly labeled, and even though \"Company names\" and \"People names\" are empty, this evaluation does not require confirming functional correctness without the input text. Thus, it is compliant with the description. Additionally, the extra sentence \"Let me know if you'd like to analyze another text!\" does not affect the compliance evaluation with respect to the required format.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
