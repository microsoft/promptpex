The sections \"Company names,\" \"People names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and \"General themes\" are all present and each provides a comma-separated list as required, even if some sections might be empty, it still technically complies since it could be the correct output given the input which we don't have. Therefore, considering the information provided, the output complies with the format strictly described in the chatbot description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
