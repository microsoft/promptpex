  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is checked against the described format. The output correctly separates categories such as \"Company names,\" \"People names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and \"General themes.\" However, the \"Company names\" and \"People names\" sections are empty. While we cannot assess the correctness without the input, the description mandates that all categories be populated, even if they list only the absence of entities in the input. Since the output does not clearly indicate the absence of companies or people by, for example, stating something like \"None\" or \"No companies found,\" it can lead to ambiguity in compliance.\n\nGiven these considerations, the output does not fully comply with the description as it lacks explicit declarations in the \"Company names\" and \"People names\" sections. Thus, it does not follow the provided format strictly. \n\nERR"
