According to the format provided, 'Company names' should list only the company names and should be followed by nothing if there are no companies to list, or a comma-separated list of company names. In the chatbot's output, 'Company names: -' indicates there are no company names listed, which does not strictly adhere to the specified format of having an empty list if there are no companies. The other categories comply with the format, separating entities correctly. The options are listed after colons, and the entities are comma-separated where appropriate.\n\nReason for violation: The format of 'Company names: -' does not match the expected output format where 'Company names:' should be followed by nothing if there are no companies.\n\nERR"
