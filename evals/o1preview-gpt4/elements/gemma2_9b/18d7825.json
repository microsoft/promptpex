The format matches the requirement as it's an explicit inclusion.\n\n3. **Specific Topics:** The topics \"remote work\" and \"video conferencing\" are mentioned. This appears to comply with listing specific topics relevant to the content.\n\n4. **General Themes:** The general themes \"impact of technology on work\" and \"rise of remote work trends\" are listed.
