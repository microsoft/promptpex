The output format mostly aligns with the required format; however, there are some discrepancies:\n\n1. **Company names**: Presented correctly with a company name listed (Amnesty International), which follows the required format of a comma-separated list (even though there's only one).\n\n2. **People names**: The section is present but left empty, which complies with the output format structure. Without the input text, we cannot evaluate whether it should have contained content. Format-wise, this section is included correctly.\n\n3. **Specific topics**: Properly formatted with the topic \"human rights.\"\n\n4. **General themes**: Properly formatted with two themes listed, separated by commas as \"advocacy, global issues.\"\n\nThe output adheres to the structure specified in the description and correctly includes each required field, using the required formatting approach. There is no structural or formatting violation.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
