  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not comply with the description given. The reasons for this are:\n\n1. The format specified in the description is not followed. The description explicitly specifies that the entities should be extracted in the format: `Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>`, and similar for other categories. However, the output uses different formatting: bullet points and different styling.\n\n2. The \"People names\" field is present but empty. The description does not say what to do if there are no people names to extract, but an empty field could be misleading or imply that the extraction was incomplete.\n\n3. The output uses asterisks (**) to denote sections, whereas the description does not specify their use, indicating a mismatch in formatting requirements.\n\nDue to these issues, the output fails to comply with the specified formatting guidelines.\n\nERR"
