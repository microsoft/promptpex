The rules specify a desired format for the output, which the chatbot follows, with sections for Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes. However, the \"Company names\" and \"People names\" sections are left blank without any indication of \"None\" or \"N/A\" if no entities were extracted, which makes it unclear whether the extraction was attempted or completed. This leads to ambiguity about the conformity to the specified format, which can be inferred as a lack of compliance. \n\nERR"
