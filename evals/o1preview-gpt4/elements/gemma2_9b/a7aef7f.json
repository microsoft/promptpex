  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not comply fully with the description. According to the guidelines, the output should be presented in the exact format specified. The output is mostly compliant, but there is a notable deviation with a missing component under \"People names.\" The section \"People names:\" should be followed by a value, even if it includes \"None\" or is marked as empty. As per the description, missing sections or incomplete formats constitute non-compliance.\n\nThinking process: I identified that each section had to have a value or a clear indication that there are no entries for that section (e.g., stating 'None' or explicitly leaving it empty). Upon examining the sections, I noted a missing entry for \"People names,\" which should have been addressed according to the specified format. Therefore, based on this omission, it does not fully align with the given output format requirements.\n\nERR"
