However, the lists for Company names and People names are empty. Since I do not have context on the input text, I cannot determine whether these categories should have been populated. Therefore, the emptiness of these categories is not a compliance issue based solely on the description rules.\n\n3. **Correct Headers and Structure**: The categories are correctly labeled, and all necessary sections are present in the output.\n\nGiven these observations, there is no explicit non-compliance with the description's structure and required format based on the output given, without speculation on the input content.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
