According to the instructions, each category should list entities in a comma-separated list, even if empty. However, for \"Company names\" and \"People names,\" the chatbot output has left the fields empty without any kind of indication. There should be a placeholder such as a pair of empty square brackets to represent empty lists. Furthermore, the \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\" categories are in line with the expected format, listing items in a comma-separated manner. But the other categories need to indicate the absence of entities properly as per the defined format in the description. \n\nERR"
