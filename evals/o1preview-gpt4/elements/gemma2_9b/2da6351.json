The output has clearly defined sections for 'Company names', 'People names', 'Specific topics', and 'General themes', as required by the description. The 'Company names' and 'People names' sections are present, although empty, which is permissible as we don't know the input text. The 'Specific topics' section contains \"Artificial intelligence, Machine learning, applications,\" and the 'General themes' section contains \"Technology trends, Future of work.\" These entries align with the required structure and format. There is also an additional sentence, which is not explicitly restricted by the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
