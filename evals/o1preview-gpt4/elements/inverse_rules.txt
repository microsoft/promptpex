The output must not consist of exactly four separate lines.
Lines may not begin with a category label followed by a colon.
The category labels may differ from "Company names", "People names", "Specific topics", and "General themes", or may be in any order.
Each category label can be written differently than specified, including changes in capitalization and spelling.
After the colon on each line, the assistant may avoid providing a comma-separated list of extracted entities corresponding to that category.
The entities in each list may include additional punctuation or be separated by other delimiters than commas.
If there are no entities to list in a category, the assistant may omit the category label or add content after the colon.
For "Company names", the assistant may choose not to extract company names or may include entities that are not official business organizations.
For "People names", the assistant may choose not to extract personal names or may include names that are not of individual persons.
For "Specific topics", the assistant may choose not to extract specific topics discussed in the text.
For "General themes", the assistant may choose not to extract general overarching themes or may include specific details instead.
The assistant may extract entities not explicitly mentioned or implied in the text.
The assistant may add extra text, explanations, or formatting beyond what is specified in the desired format.
The assistant may include numbering, bullet points, or other formatting marks besides those specified.
The assistant does not need to ensure that the output exactly matches the desired format provided, and may deviate from structure and content requirements.
