The format provided in the description has been followed: it lists company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. \n\nHowever, the phrase \"People names: -||-\" should actually specifically list people names if there are any, or use a placeholder like \"-||-\" if there are none mentioned. Without knowing the input, we assume it is compliant as it fits the description's format correctly.\n\nNo missing categories or misplaced information is present, and each section matches the expected format.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
