  "complianceText": "The chatbot output contains four sections as required by the description: company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. However, the \"Company names\" section is empty, which violates the expected format because it doesn't match the \"<comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\" format but instead is empty, thus not adhering to the requirement of extracting company names. While it might be acceptable for no company names to exist in the given input text, the format dictates that it should still technically follow this structure. Thus, it should have had comprehensive information about potential companies if present, instead of an absence with no different marking or formatting.\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
