  "complianceText": "The provided chatbot output does not conform to the specified format in the description. According to the desired format stated in the description, the output should list company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes in a comma-separated list. However, the following issues were noted:\n\n1. The \"Company names:\" and \"People names:\" are left empty. While there may be no relevant entities to list under \"Company names\" and \"People names\" in the given context (which cannot be determined without knowing the input text), the description suggests the use of a comma-separated list, implying that even no relevant entities should technically be represented as a list (which perhaps could be an empty list).\n\n2. The lists for \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\" which have values also do not use the comma-separated list format as per the required format. \"Specific topics: -||-\" and \"General themes: -||-\" suggest that if multiple topics or themes were mentioned, they should be separated by commas, even if the lists each contain a single topic or theme, plainly adhering to stated format requirements.\n\nGiven these reasons, the output does not adhere strictly to the format as explicitly described in the chatbot description.\n\nERR"
