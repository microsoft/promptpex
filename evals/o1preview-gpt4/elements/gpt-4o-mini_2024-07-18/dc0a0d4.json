  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not list any company names, even though the format specifies that it should include a comma-separated list of company names. It's possible that there are no company names to extract, but since I cannot confirm the input text, that part cannot be evaluated. However, in the \"People names\" section, it uses \"-||-\" which aligns with the format but similar to company names, it's not possible to determine correctness without the input text. For the \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\", the output does follow the required format by listing specific topics and general themes, respectively.\n\nGiven the focus is on compliance with formatting and structure rather than correctness of content, and considering all lists are followed by a colon and are formatted as comma-separated lists except where there are no entries, my decision is based solely on whether it adheres to the desired format.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
