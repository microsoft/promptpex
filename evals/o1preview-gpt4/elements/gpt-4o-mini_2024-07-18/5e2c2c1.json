The \"People names\" section is populated with \"-||-\", which does not follow the format specified in the description. The placeholder \"-||-\" should only be used if there are no names to list, and that cannot be determined without input.\n\n2. The format for the sections \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\" complies with the request, as they are given in comma-separated lists even if they contain more than one topic or theme, though it relies the input data.\n\nThe primary issue is with the \"People names\" section format usage.\n\nERR"
