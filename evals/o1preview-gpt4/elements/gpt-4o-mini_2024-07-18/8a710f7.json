  "complianceText": "The chatbot output displays extracted entities in the format specified in the description. It starts by listing company names, followed by people names, then specific topics, and finally general themes. Each category is clearly labeled and separated by a colon. Additionally, when no people names are extracted, the placeholder \"-||-\" is used, which aligns with the requirement. Since the input is unavailable, I have no way to substantiate the accuracy or completeness of the entities, so this aspect is not evaluated. The focus here is on the format and structure, which match the desired output specification.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
