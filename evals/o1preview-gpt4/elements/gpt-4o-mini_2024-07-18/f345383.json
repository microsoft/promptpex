According to the description, all categories should be followed by a list of items. \n\n1. **Company names**: The output provides an empty field. Although the list is empty here, without the input text, we cannot determine if this is incorrect; it adheres to the format requirements.\n\n2. **People names**: The output lists \"Shakespeare,\" which matches the specified format for providing a comma-separated list.\n\n3. **Specific topics**: The output lists topics as \"plays, sonnets, literature,\" properly formatted as a comma-separated list.\n\n4. **General themes**: The output lists themes as \"literature, drama, poetry,\" also properly formatted as a comma-separated list.\n\nIn all cases, the output follows the specified structure of the required format by having the category name followed by a colon and an appropriate list (comma-separated even if empty). \n\nThere are no violations related to the format requirements stated in the description. Each category is clearly presented, even if one (company names) is empty, which does not break the output rules without knowing the input. \n\nNo violation.\nOK"
