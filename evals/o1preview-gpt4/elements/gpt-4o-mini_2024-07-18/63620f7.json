  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output format is mostly correct, but there is an issue with the list separator for specific topics which does not comply with the desired format. According to the description, the separator \"-||-\" should be used consistently for all sections. However, in the output, the specific topics section does not use the separator \"-||-\" after the listed topic. The incorrect part is: \"Specific topics: commercial space flights -||-\". \n\nMy reasoning for this conclusion is based on comparing each part of the output with the required format. The company names and people names sections are correctly formatted using the desired separator. The general themes section follows the pattern with the correct separator usage after the list. However, the specific topics section does not correctly apply the separator after the listed topic.\n\nBecause of this inconsistency, the output is considered as not complying fully with the description.\n\nERR"
