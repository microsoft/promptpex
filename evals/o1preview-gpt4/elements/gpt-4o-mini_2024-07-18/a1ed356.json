The sections are properly labeled and separated by colons, and the lists are comma-separated as required. \n\nHowever, under \"People names,\" the output uses \"-||-\" instead of explicitly stating there are no people names found. The placeholder should have been empty or described clearly as a lack of people names. This minor deviation from the expected format suggests non-compliance with the exact format described in the guidelines.\n\nConsidering this, the output has a formatting issue with the \"People names\" field.\n\nERR"
