According to the requested format in the description, all sections should have a \"<comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\" placeholder or similar text if no entities are present. Not providing any information or placeholder text for \"Company names\" potentially leads to a partially complete output format, which does not align with the description's formatting requirements. \n\nMoreover, the bot's response does not provide any information indicating that there are no company names present, which is necessary to maintain a consistent output format as per the requirements.\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
