  "compliance": "err",
  "complianceText": "The output is partially structured according to the desired format, with categories for \"Company names\", \"People names\", \"Specific topics\", and \"General themes\". However, there is a deviation in the format because for \"People names\", instead of the expected comma-separated list format or clear 'None' indicator, the chatbot output uses \"-||-\". According to the description, the output should consistently adhere to the specified comma-separated format, even if no entities are present, which is not the case here. \n\nTherefore, the reasoning for the non-compliance is primarily based on the formatting inconsistency in \"People names\", which doesn't match the expected format described, and thus, violates the rule of maintaining the specified comma-separated list or standard indicator format across all sections.\n\nERR"
