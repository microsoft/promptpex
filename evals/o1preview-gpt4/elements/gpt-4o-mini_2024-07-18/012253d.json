The output format requires lists for Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes to be separated by commas when there are multiple entries and placeholders certain placeholders have a clearly mentioned separator '-||-'. In the given chatbot output, the placeholder '-||-' is correctly used for People names. However, Company names section is empty without using '-||-', which should have been used even if there were no entries. It violates the format by being left entirely empty and not consistent with the placeholder usage taught in the description which is clearly mentioned for empty sections. \n\nThe output should have been:\nCompany names: -||-\nPeople names: -||-\nSpecific topics: love, loss, self-discovery\nGeneral themes: emotional journeys, personal growth\n\nThus, this is a violation of the format requirements as per the description.\n\nERR"
