  "complianceText": "The output provided by the chatbot follows the structuring rules given in the description. It begins with extracting company names, followed by people names, specific topics, and general themes. Each section follows the specified format with a list separated by commas or the placeholder '-||-' indicating absence. \n\nHowever, there is a slight non-compliance in how the absence of people names is indicated. The instructions specify the use of a comma-separated list, and the placeholder '-||-' is somewhat unconventional and not explicitly instructed in the guidelines. Ideally, there should be an empty space following the colon (i.e., \"People names: \"), but since '-||-' can be interpreted as indicating no people names were found, this is a minimal divergence from the guidelines and not enough to warrant non-compliance by itself.\n\nSince there is no explicit statement that demands strict characters to represent the absence in the description, I'll assume it fits under acceptable interpretation.\n\nNo clear violation.\nOK"
