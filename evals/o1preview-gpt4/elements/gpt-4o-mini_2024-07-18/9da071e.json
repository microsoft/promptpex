Let's evaluate each category based on the guidelines:\n\n1. **Company names**: The section for company names is provided but left empty, which technically complies because the format is retained regardless of content. Without knowing the input, we cannot ascertain if any company names should be present or not.\n\n2. **People names**: Similarly, the section for people names is provided but left empty. It adheres to the expected format, and we cannot determine the correctness without the input.\n\n3. **Specific topics**: The specific topics are extracted and listed as \"Academy Awards, Oscars\". This complies with the format and expectation given.\n\n4. **General themes**: The general themes are extracted as \"Awards ceremonies, Film industry\". This complies with the outlined format and expectation.\n\nSince the output follows the expected format for all entities and the specific topic and general theme sections contain entries, there is no violation based on the criteria that can be evaluated without the input.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
