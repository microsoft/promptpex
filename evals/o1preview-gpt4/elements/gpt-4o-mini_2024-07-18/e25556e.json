  "complianceText": "The chatbot output generally adheres to the desired format by listing company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. However, there is a discrepancy in the \"People names\" section. The description specifies that the output should list people names in a comma-separated format, similar to the other categories. Though there were no people identified in the text, the chatbot uses \"-||-\" in place of an empty field rather than directly reiterating the format specified in the description, which could be considered as not adhering strictly to the given format. Due to this slight formatting deviation, the output is considered non-compliant.\n\nExplanation: The only violation is the use of \"-||-\" instead of a comma-separated list format as specified for listing people names, even if no people names are present. This decision was made based on the explicit format requirement outlined in the description, which suggests that using anything other than a comma-separated list is not adhering to the desired format.\n\nERR"
