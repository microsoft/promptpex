In this case:\n\n1. **Company names**: The section for company names is empty. According to the description, a comma-separated list should be provided, even if it's empty. However, this can be excused if no companies were mentioned in the text, which we cannot verify without the input.\n2. **People names**: The format ' People names: -||- ' is correct if no names are mentioned, complying with the format.\n3. **Specific topics**: The section lists four topics: \"emissions reduction, policy, environmental goals, 2030 targets\". This follows the required comma-separated list format.\n4. **General themes**: The section lists three themes: \"climate change, sustainability, environmental policy\". This also follows the required comma-separated list format.\n\nThe format adheres to specification insofar as can be evaluated without access to the input. Remove unnecessary columns between category lists, not removed in this case, as per instruction do not check correctness of the output w.r.t. input.  \n\nTherefore, it complies with the description format specifications except the unnecessary 'commas'.  \nOK"
