However, the \"Company names\" category is empty. While the description requires extracting and listing company names first, the absence of any company names could indicate two potential issues:\n\n1. The input text might not have mentioned any company, which cannot be checked without knowing the input.\n2. If company names were present in the input, they should have been listed here, which cannot be verified without knowing the input.\n\nGiven the guidelines provided, I should not infer or assume what the input contained. I will focus on the format requirement: all categories are listed, and each is separated by the requisite \"-||-\" delimiter.\n\nFollowing the description, there is no requirement for all categories to have entries; hence an empty \"Company names\" section does not violate the format as long as the structural integrity and order of the sections are respected.\n\nBased on the given guidelines and the structure being adhered to, the output is compliant with the format and order requirements.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
