The structured format is correctly followed: it begins with \"Company names,\" followed by a comma-separated list, though there is only one company mentioned here, which is \"NASA.\" Next, \"People names\" is indicated with a \"-||-\" which signifies there are no people names extracted. Similarly, both \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\" are listed with comma-separated entries, adhering to the stipulated format. Even though the content within these categories cannot be verified for correctness without the original input text, the format compliance is maintained diligently. Therefore, from a format compliance perspective, the output aligns with the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
