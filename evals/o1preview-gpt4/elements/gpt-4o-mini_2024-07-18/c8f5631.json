  "complianceText": "The evaluation of the chatbot output is as follows:\n\n1. **Company names**: The output lists no company names under \"Company names\". The chatbot description requires that company names be extracted first and presented as a comma-separated list. Since no company names are provided, I can't determine compliance without knowing the input.\n\n2. **People names**: The output lists no people names under \"People names\". The description also requires that people names be extracted and listed, though compliance cannot be checked without the input.\n\n3. **Specific topics**: The output provides \"human rights issues, international law\" under \"Specific topics\". This is presented in a comma-separated list in line with the description's required format.\n\n4. **General themes**: The output provides \"law, human rights, international relations\" under \"General themes\". This is also presented as a comma-separated list, complying with the required format.\n\nOverall, the output adheres to the required format, with entries for each category. However, without the input, compliance on detecting company names and people names cannot be determined. Since I cannot base my evaluation on parts that require input information, the output complies with formatting rules.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
