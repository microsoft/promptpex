The described format requires all entities to be extracted under specific categories: company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes.\n\n2. In this output, four categories are present:\n   - \"Company names\" where it states no entries are provided (blank line).\n   - \"People names\" lists \"Serena Williams.\"\n   - \"Specific topics\" lists \"Grand Slam title, Australian Open.\"\n   - \"General themes\" lists \"sports achievements, tennis championships.\"\n\n3. The format and structuring guideline is followed with all listed categories being clearly labeled and separated correctly. Each entity type has its own dedicated line that starts with the category name followed by a colon.\n\n4. No violations occur in terms of format structuring. The description does not mandate all categories to contain entries, so a blank line for \"Company names\" is permitted by the guidelines, as no input is provided to determine if omission of content is correct.\n\nBased on this analysis, the format of the output complies with the given description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
