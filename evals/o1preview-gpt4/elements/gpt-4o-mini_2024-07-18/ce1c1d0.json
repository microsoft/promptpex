  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is expected to follow a specific format, which includes sections for company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. The format instructs that each section should contain information separated by commas within the angle brackets, and if there is no data to input, it should still display the relevant tag. In this case, the output does not comply with the specified format for two reasons:\n\n1. The \"Company names:\" section is empty, but it does not use the \"-||-\" placeholder as instructed. Instead, it is left completely blank.\n\n2. The \"People names:\" section correctly uses \"-||-\" to indicate no data, following the required format. \n\nTherefore, I have identified a violation in the adherence to the format, specifically in the \"Company names:\" section, because it does not follow the prescribed format as stipulated in the description.\n\nERR"
