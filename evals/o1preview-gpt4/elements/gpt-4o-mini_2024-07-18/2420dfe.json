  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output adheres mostly to the required format; however, there is a violation with how the \"People names\" section is handled. The format specifies the use of \"-||-\" to denote the absence of names, but the output does not follow this rule correctly. Instead of \"-||-\" for missing entities, the specific item that isn't available should be completely spelled out as lacking. Furthermore, the \"People names\" should correctly use the '-||-' format or explicitly state there are no people. The rest of the structure complies with the formatting rules by listing entities in a comma-separated list and organizing the extracted information into the specified categories. \n\nGiven this discrepancy with the \"People names\" format, the output does not precisely comply with the described rules.\n\nERR"
