Each category is addressed in the output, even though some sections (Company names and People names) are empty, which is permissible since the input may not have contained relevant data for those categories. The 'Specific topics' and 'General themes' categories are filled with entries fitting their respective purposes. Therefore, the format aligns with the description provided.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
