While the description asks for all company names to be extracted, it does not specify that every section must be populated regardless of the content. Therefore, as long as the section exists in the output, it complies. The other sections are populated.\n\n3. **Order Compliance**: The order of sections is compliant with the description, listing Company names first, followed by People names, Specific topics, and General themes.\n\nSince the output adheres to the required format and order, with no additional rules requiring every section to have content, there are no violations based on the description provided.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
