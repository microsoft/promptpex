  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output should strictly follow the desired format outlined in the description. Let's breakdown the output into sections:\n\n- \"Company names: IBM\" complies with the desired format as it lists a company name after the required label.\n\n- \"People names: world chess champion\" does not comply with the desired format. The format requires a list of actual people names but \"world chess champion\" is not a proper name, it's a title or position.\n\n- \"Specific topics: Deep Blue, chess, artificial intelligence\" correctly provides a comma-separated list after the label \"Specific topics;\" this follows the desired format.  \n\n- \"General themes: technology, competition, achievement in computing\" also appropriately follows the format by providing a comma-separated list following the \"General themes\" label.\n\nThe violation lies in the \"People names\" section, as it does not provide a comma-separated list of specific people names. Rather, it provides a generic title which does not align with the description's requirement. Therefore, this is a violation of the formats described.\n\nERR"
