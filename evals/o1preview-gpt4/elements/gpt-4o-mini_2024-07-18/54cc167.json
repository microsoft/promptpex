Instead, the output uses \"-||-\", which is not compliant with the description provided.\n\nIn conclusion, while the company names, specific topics, and general themes are all presented in the format required, the section for people names uses an incorrect placeholder instead of leaving it empty or confirming none were found. Thus, it does not adhere entirely to the chatbot description.\n\nERR"
