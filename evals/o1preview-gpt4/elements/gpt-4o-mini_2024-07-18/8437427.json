  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is missing the comma-separated list for company names, as it simply provides an empty space after \"Company names:\". Additionally, the format for the list under \"People names\" is not consistent with the description, which expects a comma-separated list, even if no names are present; in this case, it could have been left empty or explicitly stated as none.\n\nOnly the \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\" sections adhere to the expected format as outlined in the description. Based on these observations, the output is non-compliant with the provided description. This reasoning leads to the conclusion that there is a formatting and compliance issue with listing company and people names sections.\n\nERR"
