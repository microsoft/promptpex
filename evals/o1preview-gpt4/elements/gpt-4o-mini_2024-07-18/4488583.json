  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output is structured according to the format specified in the description. The output includes fields for \"Company names,\" \"People names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and \"General themes.\" Each field is separated by a newline, and the fields seem to be filled according to the type of entities that they pertain to.\n\n1. **Company names** is listed as \"Disney,\" which fits the format as a comma-separated list. Although in this case, it's just one name, it fits the expected output format.\n\n2. **People names** is represented as \"-||-\", indicating no names were extracted. This aligns with the required format when no entities are found for a category.\n\n3. **Specific topics** is listed as \"theme park attraction, Star Wars,\" again in a comma-separated list, matching the expected format.\n\n4. **General themes** is listed as \"entertainment, amusement parks, franchises,\" which follows the expected comma-separated format for this section as well.\n\nThe output complies with the structural format specified in the description, presenting company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes in the correct order and format. I cannot evaluate the correctness of the entities extracted without input text, but the format does align correctly with the requirements.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
