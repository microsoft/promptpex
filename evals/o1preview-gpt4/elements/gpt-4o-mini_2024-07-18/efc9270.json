According to the description, the chatbot should extract company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. The format requires each category to contain a comma-separated list, even if it is empty. In this output:\n\n1. The \"Company names\" section is empty and not in a comma-separated list format as required.\n2. The remaining sections (\"People names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and \"General themes\") are correctly formatted as comma-separated lists.\n\nHowever, despite the first section being empty, the format has not been adhered to, as there should still be a representation of a comma-separated list, even if there are no company names to list.\n\nTherefore, this output violates the format rule as specified and needs adjustment to comply with the description.\n\nERR"
