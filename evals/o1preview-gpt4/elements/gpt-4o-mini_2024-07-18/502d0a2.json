  "complianceText": "The output violates the description's format requirement in the \"People names\" list. The description specifies using \"<comma_separated_list_of_people_names>\" format without the use of \"-||-\". The format for all items must be consistent with the template provided, and using \"-||-\" instead of an empty string when no entries are available constitutes a violation of the format rule.\n\nAdditionally, the \"Company names\" and \"Specific Topics\" lists use a space after the comma, but given there is only one entry per category respectively, this cannot be verified. \n\nFurthermore, the approach for indicating no entries in \"People names\" should follow the format without inserting placeholders like \"-||-\", ensuring it matches the example formatting provided in the guidelines.\n\nERR"
