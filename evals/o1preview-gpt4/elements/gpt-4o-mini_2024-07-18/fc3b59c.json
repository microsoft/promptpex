The output adheres to the required format: Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes are all present in the specified sections.\n\nHowever, the 'People names' section displays \"-||-\", which may imply that there are no people names to extract, and the description does allow for cases with no entities in a category. Similarly, for Company names, Specific topics, and General themes, entries are provided as comma-separated lists consistent with the expected structure.\n\nNo specific parts of the output violate the format laid out in the description. Therefore, my reasoning concludes that the format requirements are fulfilled by this output, considering that missing entities have been correctly handled by indicating no entries when applicable.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
