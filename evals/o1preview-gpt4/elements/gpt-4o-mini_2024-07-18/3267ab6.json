  "complianceText": "The chatbot output partially complies with the description. The format and order specified have been followed properly. However, there is an issue with the 'People names' section where it incorrectly uses the same delimiter \"-||-\" as placeholders instead of leaving it empty. According to the description, the format indicated for lists is a comma-separated list, suggesting that if there are no entries, the section should likely be left empty and not incorrectly marked with a placeholder. \n\nThus, the output violates the required format where no placeholder or any other symbol is to be used for a section with no content, as the description does not specify any placeholders for missing entries. \n\nERR"
