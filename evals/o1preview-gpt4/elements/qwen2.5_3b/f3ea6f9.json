  "complianceText": "The chatbot output deviates from the description in several ways. Firstly, the formatting for indicating the absence of company names does not follow the description. The format implies that the section should contain a comma-separated list of company names. If there are no company names to be extracted, it is more conventional to possibly leave it blank rather than using \"<no_company_names>\", which is not specified in the description. Furthermore, the absence of matching delimiters for \"People names\", indicated as \"-||-\" rather than an actual list or a more accurately specified absence, is incorrect according to typical comma-separated formatting as suggested by the description. \n\nNo violation of rules could be determined for correctness due to lack of input but format once can be determined, leading to a decision of non-compliance.\n\nERR"
