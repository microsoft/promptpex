The output should include four categories: company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes.\n\n- The category \"Company names\" includes \"Nike\", which adheres to the expectation of listing company names.\n- The category \"People names\" is present but empty, which complies with the format as people names might not be present in the given text.\n- The category \"Specific topics\" includes \"New Running Shoes\" and \"Athletes Endorsements\", which fits the requirement to extract specific topics.\n- The category \"General themes\" includes \"Fashion\", \"Sports Industry\", and \"Product Launch\", which fits the requirement to extract overarching themes.\n\nEach required category is present, and the format adheres to the guidelines provided in the description. No explicit violation in the structure is observed. Thus, based solely on the expectation of the format without needing to know the input text, the output is compliant.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
