The company names, specific topics, and general themes are provided in a comma-separated list (even if containing only one item or none) which aligns with the desired structure. However, the section for \"People names\" is marked with a hyphen but lacks any mention in the event of no names being found, the comma-separated list should still indicate no entries clearly like the other sections do.\n\nMoreover, the transition structure does not consistently follow the verbatim description for \"People names,\" suggesting there was an oversight in maintaining consistent formatting.\n\nTherefore, there's a violation due to inconsistency in format presentation for the \"People names\" section.\n\nERR"
