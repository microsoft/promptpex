  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is almost in the desired format, but there is a non-compliance issue. The pattern expected is that the categories are labeled followed by a colon and then a comma-separated list of the relevant items. While this format is technically followed, the section for company names is empty, and the section for people names contains the placeholder \"-||-\" rather than being left empty or containing items. This placeholder is not mentioned in the desired format description.\n\nHere is my reasoning: \n1. Complying format would be \"Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\", if there are no company names, it should still have some standard way to communicate emptiness, such as simply \"Company names: \".\n2. The output for people names should not contain the placeholder \"-||-\" as it is not defined in the guideline and should have a consistent format like other sections (either listing extracted names or being empty).\n\nThese deviations from the explicitly specified format in the description lead me to conclude that the output does not fully comply with the instructions.\n\nERR"
