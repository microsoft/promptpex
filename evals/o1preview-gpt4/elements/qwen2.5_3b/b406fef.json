However, for \"Company names,\" \"People names,\" and \"Specific topics,\" the output does not follow a consistent format based on the description. The \"People names\" section uses '-||-' which is not mentioned in the description for representing an empty list. Instead, it should be empty as shown after \"Company names\". The presence of \"-||-\" in \"People names\" does not adhere to the format described, where an empty list should be indicated by nothing after the colon.\n\nERR"
