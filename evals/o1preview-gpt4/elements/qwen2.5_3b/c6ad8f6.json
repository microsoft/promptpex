The lists include commas to separate multiple entities, although for some categories, they are listed as \"None.\" This is compliant because it acknowledges that there might not always be content to populate every category. Therefore, the output adheres to the structure - it has all required headings (Company names, People names, Specific topics, General themes) and fills them accordingly.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
