The \"Company names\" section is left empty, which does not violate the format per se since there might not be any company names mentioned, but a specific point here is that it's not in the desired \"<comma_separated_list>\" format. Whether empty or not, it should be represented in a list following the desired format.\n\n2. The \"People names\" section does not follow the required \"<comma_separated_list>\" format. Instead, it just mentions \"CEO,\" which is not separated by commas or presented in any form of a list.\n\nThese deviations in format from the specified requirement are clear violations, leading to the conclusion that the output does not comply.\n\nERR"
