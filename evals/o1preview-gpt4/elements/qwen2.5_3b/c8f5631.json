The required separator for \"People names\" is a comma-separated list, similar to \"Company names,\" rather than \"-||-\". Additionally, although not directly verifiable without input, the provided topics and themes follow the expected format. However, due to the inconsistency in using the separator for \"People names,\" this constitutes non-compliance with the described format.\n\nERR"
