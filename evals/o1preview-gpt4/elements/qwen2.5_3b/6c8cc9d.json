  "complianceText": "The evaluation of the chatbot's output against the provided guidelines reveals a violation of the desired format. Specifically, the format for \"People names\" should include a comma-separated list or an exact match of \"-||-\" as specified in the guidelines. Similarly, other categories which are empty should match \"-||-\", indicating that there are no entities to mention. However, in the current output, the \"People names\" category correctly uses \"-||-\", but the other categories do not comply with the specified deliminator. Therefore, the output does not fully comply with the described structure as the delimiter for empty lists was not applied consistently.\n\nCompany names: \"Google\" is in the correct format.\nSpecific topics: \"Pixel, Tech Expo\" is in the correct format.\nGeneral themes: \"Smartphone Release, Technology Exhibition\" is in the correct format.\n\nExplanation of Violation: The violation is due to the inconsistent use of delimiters for empty categories except for \"People names\". If a category is empty, it should be represented by \"-||-\", not left listed with potential extracted entities without verification.\n\nERR"
