However, the \"Company names\" section contains a placeholder \"<no_company_names>\" instead of a descriptive phrase indicating the absence of company names, which does not comply with the intended human-readable format. The description expects a comma-separated list or a clearly stated absence of entities when none are found, rather than a placeholder text.\n\nTherefore, the output does not comply with the description due to the use of \"<no_company_names>\" instead of a human-readable, formatted statement indicating that no company names were found.\n\nERR"
