  "complianceText": "The chatbot output partially follows the format as described initially. It lists the company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes in a clear manner. However, there is a violation present: the list of \"People names\" is represented with a hyphen (-) instead of an empty list to indicate that there are no people names extracted from the text. According to the desired format, the expectation is to have a comma-separated list, which in case of no elements should likely be represented as an empty list, not a hyphen.\n\nThis aspect of the output doesn't comply with the chatbot's description, which expects a consistent format, likely requiring an empty space if there are no names, rather than a hyphen to imply no names are present.\n\nERR"
