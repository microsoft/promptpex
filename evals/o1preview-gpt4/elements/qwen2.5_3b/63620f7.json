The company names, specific topics, and general themes are extracted and listed correctly. However, there is an issue with the format of \"People names.\" According to the description, if there are no entities to list under a category, it should either be left empty or represented appropriately. The current format using '-||-' for \"People names\" is acceptable based on the description, which suggests the use of \"-||-\" for empty lists. Therefore, there is no violation related to the format.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
