  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output provides information in the format specified by the guidelines. It lists company names, specific topics, and general themes, as required. However, it leaves \"People names\" as \"-\", which is consistent with how to format categories when no entities are present, based on typical linguistic conventions. Since the availability of people names depends on the input, which I do not have, the absence can't be judged for compliance. Therefore, the output adheres to the structural requirements laid out in the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
