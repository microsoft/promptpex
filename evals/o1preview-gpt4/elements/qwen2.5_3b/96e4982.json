  "complianceText": "The chatbot output lists names under \"Company names\" which are Beyoncé and Jay-Z. These are not company names but rather names of people as evidenced by their listing under \"People names\" as well. This violates the requirement for listing only company names in the \"Company names\" section. Additionally, the names are listed under \"People names\" correctly.\n\nThe \"Specific topics\" are listed as Collaboration and Album, which are correctly formatted as a comma-separated list, similar to the \"General themes\" of Music and Partnership. Both these sections comply with the formatting guidelines.\n\nTherefore, the non-compliance arises from the incorrect listing of Beyoncé and Jay-Z as company names. \n\nERR"
