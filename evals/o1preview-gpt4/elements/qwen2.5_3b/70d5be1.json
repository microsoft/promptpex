  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is structured according to the required format as specified in the description. It begins by listing company names, followed by people names, specific topics, and general themes. Each category entry is separated by a colon, which aligns with the directive for using the \"<comma_separated_list>\" format. However, there is an issue with the formatting under the \"People names\" category. Instead of using a comma-separated list or an indicator of absence (such as leaving it blank or using \"None\"), it uses \"-||-\", which does not align with the format described for listing entities even if it's empty. Although \"-||-\" seems to indicate the absence of people names, it is not compliant with the explicit format requirements mentioned in the description. Therefore, this constitutes a violation.\n\nERR"
