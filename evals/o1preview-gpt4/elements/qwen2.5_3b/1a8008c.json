  "complianceText": "Upon examining the chatbot output, the format generally aligns correct with the description provided. The output lists entities in the specified categories: company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. However, there is a formatting inconsistency in the \"People names\" section. Instead of separating names with a comma, the section incorrectly uses hyphens around \"Christopher Nolan,\" and includes another hyphen as a separator within the section, which does not adhere to the format specified in the description (\"<comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\"). \n\nOther sections appropriately use commas to separate multiple entries and correctly use '<none>' for sections without entities. The inconsistency in the \"People names\" section constitutes a violation of the specified output format.\n\nTherefore, the output does not fully comply with the description based on the strictly defined format.\n\nERR"
