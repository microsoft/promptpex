  "complianceText": "The output starts with a section for company names, where \"Federal Reserve\" is mentioned. The chatbot description requires a comma-separated list, although it is not clear if a single entry should also be in a list form. Nonetheless, since only one company name is listed, this could be seen as compliant. The description specifies that no mention should be made under 'People names,' which matches the -||- placeholder exactly.\n\nFor specific topics and general themes, the output lists several entries. Both sections seem appropriately structured in terms of listing the extracted elements in line with what might be expected based on the description. Regarding the format, a comma-separated list is used where necessary, fulfilling the mentioned requirements.\n\nThe structured format is adhered to, and each category is addressed. Hence, based on the description provided and the output evaluated, there does not appear to be any explicit violation of the expected format.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
