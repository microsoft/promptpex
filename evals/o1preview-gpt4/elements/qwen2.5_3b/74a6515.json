  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output generally follows the desired format, but there is an inconsistency with the \"People names\" field. As per the desired format in the description, if there are no entities to list in a category, it should still use the format with an empty placeholder, such as \"<comma_separated_list_of_people_names>\". However, in the output provided, it uses a hyphen \"-\" instead of an empty list formatted with \"<comma_separated_list>\". This violates the rule for direct compliance with the described format.\n\nAdditionally, for each category, the entities should be separated by commas in a list format, even if the list is empty, it should still use \"<comma_separated_list>\". Here, the format for \"People names\" does not strictly fit this requirement. \n\nTherefore, based on the output not completely adhering to the specified format, the evaluation is as follows:\n\nThe reasoning is that the output has not used the \"<comma_separated_list>\" format for the people names and a hyphen is used instead which does not explicitly comply with the description given.\n\nERR"
