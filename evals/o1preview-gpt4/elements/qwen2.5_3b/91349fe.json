The format requires:\n\n- Listing company names\n- Listing people names\n- Listing specific topics\n- Listing general themes\n\nEach of these lists should be comma-separated as per the desired format, even if they are empty.\n\nEvaluation of the output:\n\n1. **Company Names**: The output field \"Company names\" is empty without a comma-separated list format (\"Company names: \"). This seems to comply since it does not specify a different format for an empty list.\n\n2. **People Names**: The placeholder \"-||-\" indicates an empty list and it adheres to the required format with a comma-separated placeholder.\n\n3. **Specific Topics**: The topics \"renewable_energy, future\" are correctly comma-separated and follow the required format.\n\n4. **General Themes**: The themes \"sustainability, technology\" are also correctly comma-separated and conform to the required format.\n\nConsidering compliance with the format (ignoring correctness as it requires knowing the input), the output adheres to all specified formatting requirements laid out in the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
