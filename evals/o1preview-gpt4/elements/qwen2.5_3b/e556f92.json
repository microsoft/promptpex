In this case, the output adheres to the format by providing each category in the prescribed order. The output contains:\n\n- \"Company names\" which is present but empty.\n- \"People names\" which is also correctly labeled as empty.\n- \"Specific topics\" as \"commemoration, monument, heroes\" which complies with having multiple specific topics.\n- \"General themes\" as \"history, remembrance\" which complies with having overarching themes.\n\nAll categories are mentioned in the desired format, and no part of the output requires checking against input-specific content. Therefore, there does not appear to be a violation based on the description's guidelines.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
