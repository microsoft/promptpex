  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is structured in the format specified by the description, with each section (Company names, People names, Specific topics, General themes) clearly labeled and separated. The description demands a comma-separated list for all categories, and the output adheres to this format where applicable (e.g., \"Company names: Reddit\"). It's important to note that the People names section is not followed by a comma-separated list but rather a hyphen, which implies no people names were extracted. This still fits the format since no names are present. Lastly, all sections have been addressed in sequence and are clear in their content.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
