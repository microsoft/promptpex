  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not comply with the description. The output is missing company names, which is a required list as per the desired format, even if there are no companies mentioned, it should be listed with an empty value indicated by a placeholder like a comma or similar. Additionally, the separator \"-||-\" is missing for \"Company names\" as required in the format.\n\nExplanation: The required format indicates that even if a category such as company names is empty, it should still have a placeholder or separator to indicate the absence of content. Furthermore, the separator \"-||-\" is specified for separating lists within the output categories, and it is present in other sections but is missing for \"Company names,\" leading to a format inconsistency.\n\nERR"
