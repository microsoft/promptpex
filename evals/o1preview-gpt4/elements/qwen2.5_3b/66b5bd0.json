The issue lies with the format of the \"Company names\" category, which includes a person's name \"Leonardo da Vinci\" and a hyphen \"-\". According to the description, company names should be presented as a comma-separated list of only company names. The presence of a person's name in that section, along with an erroneous hyphen, violates the structure outlined in the description. Due to this format violation, the output does not meet compliance standards.\n\nERR"
