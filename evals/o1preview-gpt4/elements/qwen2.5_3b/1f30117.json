  "complianceText": "The format provided by the chatbot in its output partially complies with the desired format, but there are a few elements of non-compliance with the description. Firstly, people names are represented with a hyphen. It should, according to the instruction, be written in the format <comma_separated_list_of_people_names> which means an empty list should also be explicitly stated rather than using a different symbol to represent it.\n\nSecondly, some specific topics are unnecessarily duplicated with the inclusion of 'IBM' which is already mentioned under company names. The specification implies the need to focus on extracting unique specific topics. However, this point involves knowing the input to some extent, so there is some ambiguity if this representation violates the rule.\n\nBased on direct evaluation, the deviation in representing people names violates the explicit format requirement.\n\nERR"
