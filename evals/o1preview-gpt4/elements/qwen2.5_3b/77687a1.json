According to the description, the output should only list company names under \"Company names,\" but \"United Nations\" is not a company name; it is an international organization. Additionally, the \"People names\" section does not have any names listed and instead uses \"-||-\", which is incorrect according to the desired format. Instead, it should contain a comma-separated list if there are any names, or be empty if there are none. The sections \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\" are formatted correctly according to the guidelines. However, due to the violation of the format in the \"Company names\" and \"People names\" sections, this output does not comply with the description.\n\nERR"
