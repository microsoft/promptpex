Each section is properly labeled as per the requirement.\n\n2. **Comma-Separated Lists**: The chatbot output contains 'comma-separated lists' as expected, even for sections with only one entry (“Company names: Amazon Web Services” and “Specific topics: cloud computing”).\n\n3. **Empty Sections**: For the 'People names' section, the output correctly uses '-||-' to indicate no entries, as required by the description.\n\n4. **Themes and Topics**: The division between 'Specific topics' and 'General themes' is maintained in the output, and there are no overlaps between entities and themes.\n\nSince the output meets all the formal requirements set by the description and does not have any elements that contravene the guidelines provided, it complies with the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
