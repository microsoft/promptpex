  "complianceText": "Upon evaluating the chatbot's output, I identified a compliance issue. In the 'Company names' section, the name \"Beyoncé\" is listed, which is a person name, not a company name. Following the strict format given in the description, company names should only include actual company names. People names and company names should be clearly distinguished, and the output violates this by including a person name under company names. Therefore, this is a violation of the description guidelines.\n\nERR"
