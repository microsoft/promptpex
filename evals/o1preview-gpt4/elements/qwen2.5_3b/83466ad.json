The format requires \"Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\". In the output, the section is present, but it is empty. However, without knowing the input, we cannot determine if this is a compliance issue or not.\n\n2. The section \"People names: -||-\" follows the required format of listing entities, indicating no violation in format compliance. Similarly, the fact that it's empty doesn't necessarily indicate non-compliance, as it depends on the unseen input.\n\n3. The \"Specific topics\" section contains items that fit the required format for specific topics related to the possible content.\n\n4. The \"General themes\" section is populated and follows the required format.\n\nSince the evaluation involves only checking the adherence to format and structure and does not concern itself with correctness (due to the absence of input), there are no explicit compliance issues detectable from the output provided. \n\nNo violation.\nOK"
