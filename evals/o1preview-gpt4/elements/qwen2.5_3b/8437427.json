The output must adhere to the format \"Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names> People names: -||- Specific topics: -||- General themes: -||-\", which includes listing company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes, even if a certain category is empty. \n\nThe evaluation reveals the following:\n- The \"Company names:\" field lists no companies, which is indicated correctly by an empty space, complying with the expected format.\n- The \"People names:\" field uses the placeholder \"-||-\", which correctly follows the format for an absence of data.\n- The \"Specific topics:\" section lists \"advances, renewable energy\" in accordance with the format, despite the lack of specified input for correctness.\n- The \"General themes:\" section correctly lists \"innovation, sustainability, future technology\" consistent with the format.\n\nEvery part of the output follows the format prescribed in the chatbot description. There is no deviation from the expected structure, and the placeholders for any missing categories are correctly utilized.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
