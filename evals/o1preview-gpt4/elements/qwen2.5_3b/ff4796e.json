According to the description, the desired format should be a comma-separated list. Instead, \"<no_company_names>\" is used, which doesn't comply with the required format. The chatbot should use an empty field or the word \"none\" without angle brackets to indicate no company names are present. This inconsistency constitutes a violation of the described format guidelines.\n\nERR"
