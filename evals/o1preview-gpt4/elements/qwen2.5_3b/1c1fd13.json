Here's my assessment:\n\n- **Company names:** The format requires a comma-separated list, and \"Apple Inc.\" is listed as expected. No compliance issue here.\n- **People names:** The format is complied with using \"Tim Cook,\" which is presented as expected.\n- **Specific topics:** The format is followed with \"new iPhone, launch event, Apple Inc.\" listed in a comma-separated manner.\n- **General themes:** Complies with the required format with \"technology release, corporate announcements\" as the listed general themes.\n\nEach section of the output follows the specified format in the description, with each category properly separated and labeled. There is no reference to verify if the content is correct due to lack of input, so compliance can only be assessed based on format, which is followed accurately.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
