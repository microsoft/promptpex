  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output does not comply with the description provided. Firstly, the format used for \"no_company_names\" does not follow the expected format according to the description. The description specifies a comma-separated list of company names, implying that if there are no company names, it should likely be left empty or stated more explicitly as \"none,\" not \"<no_company_names>.\"\n\nAdditionally, the use of \"Climate变化\" seems to be a mix of English and non-English language, which is inconsistent with the rest of the output format that uses English. This inconsistency is a form of non-compliance with the expected output format, which should be uniform in language.\n\nGiven these reasons, the output does not fully comply with the guidelines specified in the description.\n\nERR"
