  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output does not comply with its description due to the following reasons: \n\n1. The \"Company names\" field is present but contains no information. It is expected to either have a list of company names if any are present in the text, or remain empty, but it should not include any placeholder text or symbols.\n   \n2. The \"People names\" field is represented with \"-||-\". The description implies an expectation for a comma-separated list of names if any were mentioned in the text. Thus, this is not an appropriate way to indicate none were found, if that was the intent, it should just remain empty.\n\nThe description specifies that these fields should contain comma-separated lists or no indications at all if none are found, hence placeholders or symbols like \"-||-\" are non-compliant with the expected format.\n\nIn conclusion, the output uses an incorrect format for representing empty entity fields, which doesn't fulfill the requirement as per the guidelines. Thus, it violates the prescribed format for company and people names.\n\nERR"
