Under \"People names\", the output uses `-||-`, which corresponds correctly to the format specified when there are no entries in a particular category.\n\n2. The rest of the categories each contain a list, appropriately separated by commas.\n\n3. The output is structured as per the desired format:\n    - Company names have been placed under \"Company names\".\n    - People names are empty and correctly represented by `-||-`.\n    - Specific topics and general themes are correctly listed under their respective categories.\n\nThe evaluation task requires checking for adherence to the specified format, not the content's correctness without input reference. The format appears to have been followed correctly, thus no violation has been found in terms of compliance.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
