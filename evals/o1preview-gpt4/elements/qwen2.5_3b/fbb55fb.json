However, the output presents \"<no_company_names>\" instead of an empty list or an appropriate response indicating there are no company names. Additionally, \"The United Nations\" is listed under \"People names,\" which is incorrect as it is not a name of a person; it appears to be an organization or entity possibly relevant to the text. This further suggests a violation of adhering to the order and categorization of entities as described.\n\nERR"
