The format requires four distinct categories: Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes.\n\n1. **Company names**: The output lists \"Facebook\" as a company name. This section complies with the required format.\n\n2. **People names**: The output here is empty. While this might mean there were no people names mentioned in the text, compliance with format means the category is present, so this complies with the format as the description does not mandate non-empty lists.\n\n3. **Specific topics**: The output lists \"Virtual Reality Headsets, Facebook\". This section complies with the required format. \n\n4. **General themes**: The output lists \"Technology, Innovation\". This section complies with the required format.\n\nOverall, the output is in the correct format as specified by the description. There are no violations related to format or structure identified in the output. As the presence of content in categories is not a compliance issue unless specified, and lacking input context, the primary requirement is the format which is met.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
