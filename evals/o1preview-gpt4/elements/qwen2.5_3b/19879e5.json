There is no indication from the output whether this is intentional due to the input text having no company names or whether it was missed. However, without knowing the input, the compliance issues arise from the formatting, as the description suggests this should be a comma-separated list even if empty or none present (e.g., \"Company names: -||-\" if intentionally left empty).\n\nGiven these reasons, the output does not comply with the specified format in the description.\n\nERR"
