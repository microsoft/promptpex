According to the desired format, if there are no entities to display, the placeholders `<no_company_names>`, `-||-`, or similar must not be used; these placeholders seem to be incorrectly formatted or used. For \"Company names\" and \"People names\", the description implies using an empty space or simply omitting elements if they aren't present, rather than using placeholder text like `<no_company_names>`. Specifically, the output uses malformed placeholders and symbols `-||-` where it should be using correct formatting according to the guidelines. This constitutes a violation of the output format rules.\n\nERR"
