The format of a comma-separated list is correctly used, and there are no inconsistencies with the description format in this part.\n\n2. **People Names**: A hyphen (\"-\") is used to denote that there are no people names. This follows the desired format.\n\n3. **Specific Topics**: The output lists \"United Nations Climate Change Conference, COP26\", which follows the comma-separated list format.\n\n4. **General Themes**: The output lists \"climate change conference, upcoming event\".
