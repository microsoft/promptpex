It first provides a list of company names under \"Company names,\" followed by an entry for \"People names,\" even though it's empty (represented by a dash), which is acceptable in absence of any people names. Then it lists \"Specific topics,\" maintaining the format of a comma-separated list (though only one topic is mentioned). Finally, it lists \"General themes,\" also in the correct format. Each section is explicitly labeled, and the format is consistent throughout, adhering to the requirements of the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
