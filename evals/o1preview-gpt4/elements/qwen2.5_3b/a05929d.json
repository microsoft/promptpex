Next, it uses \"-||-\" correctly for \"People names,\" indicating none were mentioned. This format follows the guidelines. For \"Specific topics,\" it lists \"booking, lodging, experiences,\" which also fits within the expected guidelines. It further lists \"General themes\" as \"platforms, accommodations, experiences, transactions,\" which follows the format as described.\n\nIn summary, it uses the correct format: listing relevant entities under each category. All sections have been addressed and formatted appropriately as per the description. \n\nNo violation.\nOK"
