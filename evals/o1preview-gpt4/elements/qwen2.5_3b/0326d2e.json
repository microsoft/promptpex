  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output does not comply with the description for several reasons. \n\n1. The 'People names' section is meant to have a comma-separated list of people names without any extra characters. However, it contains \"-, Jack Dorsey\", which includes a comma with a dash before Jack Dorsey, which is not in the correct format as per the description.\n   \n2. The 'Specific topics' section is populated with \"-||-\", which is not the correct representation of a comma-separated list as specified in the description. The description expects a comma-separated list, and anything else is a deviation.\n\n3. Similarly, the 'General themes' section is populated with \"-||-\", which again is not the correct format for a comma-separated list. This deviates from the specified format as well.\n\nThe description specifies a specific format for each section, and the output contains sections that do not follow this format precisely. Therefore, this output does not comply with the description.\n\nERR"
