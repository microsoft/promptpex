- Prompt Under Test (PUT) - like Program Under Test; the prompt
- Model Under Test (MUT) - Model which we are testing against with specific temperature, etc example: gpt-4o-mini
- Model Used by PromptPex (MPP) - gpt-4o

- Input Specification (IS) - Extracting input constraints of PUT using MPP
- Output Rules (OR) - Extracting output constraints of PUT using MPP
- Output Rules Groundedness (ORG) - Checks if OR is grounded in PUT using MPP

- Prompt Under Test Intent (PUTI) - Extracting the exact task from PUT using MMP

- PromptPex Tests (PPT) - Test cases generated for PUT with MPP using IS and OR
- Baseline Tests (BT) - Zero shot test cases generated for PUT with MPP

- Test Input Compliance (TIC) - Checking if PPT and BT meets the constraints in IS using MPP
- Test Coverage (TC) - Result generated for PPT and BT on PUTI + OR with MPP

- Test Output (TO) - Result generated for PPT and BT on PUT with each MUT
