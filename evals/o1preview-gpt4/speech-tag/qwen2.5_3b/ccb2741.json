The output is in compliance with the rules specified: it returns only the part of speech tag, and it does not include any additional information or text. There is no indication that the chatbot output violates any rules, and since I am not checking correctness (because it requires knowing the input), my evaluation is solely focused on compliance with the format specified in the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
