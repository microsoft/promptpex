The task is to determine the part of speech for a given word and return just the tag. The output is a single part-of-speech tag, as required.\n\nThe output does not contain any extraneous information or formatting, just the tag itself. It also does not fall into the category of needing to be \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\" unless that determination requires knowledge of the input, which I am instructed to disregard. \n\nThus, based on the information provided, the output complies with the description of returning the appropriate part-of-speech tag.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
