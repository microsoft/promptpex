However, the output appears to contain a non-standard emoji or character at the end. The description clearly states that the output should be a part of speech tag from the list provided. The presence of this additional character means that the output does not conform strictly to one of the listed tags. Therefore, this output does not comply with the description since only the part of speech tag itself should be returned without any additional characters.\n\nERR"
