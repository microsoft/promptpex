  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output is \"NNS\", which is a valid part-of-speech tag listed in the description: \"NNS: Noun, plural.\" The output is a compliant response because it provides a part-of-speech tag and does not include any extraneous information or formatting errors. There is no indication of a need for \"CantAnswer\" or \"Unknown\" since we do not have the sentence; hence, without knowing the input, we cannot judge on this aspect but can confirm the output format adheres to the description, which is the main compliance factor when the input is unknown.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
