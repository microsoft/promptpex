The output complies with the description since it returns only the part of speech tag, which is explicitly mentioned in the list of part-of-speech tags provided in the task description. The output does not contain any additional information or explanation, hence it adheres to returning only the part of speech tag as required. No assumptions are made about correctness because that would require knowledge of the input. Given the constraints, there is nothing in the output that violates the described rules.\n\nOK"
