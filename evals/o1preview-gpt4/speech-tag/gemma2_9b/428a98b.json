The task requires the chatbot to return only the part of speech tag for a given word, which it has done. The description allows for situations where the specific tag doesn't match any listed tags to return \"Unknown\" and if unable to tag to return \"CantAnswer.\" However, these conditions are not applicable here as the output is a valid tag. Since the output is only the tag and does not contain any additional information, it complies with the provided task description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
