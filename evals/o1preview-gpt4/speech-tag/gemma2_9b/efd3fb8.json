The output is strictly a part-of-speech tag, as required by the description, with no additional text. There are no issues or violations regarding the format or content of the output based on the criteria given, as it neither provides an unlisted part of speech nor an inappropriate response such as \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\" without input-specific context. Therefore, the chatbot's output is compliant with the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
