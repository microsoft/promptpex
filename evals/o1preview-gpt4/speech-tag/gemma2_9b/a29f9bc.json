According to the description provided, the chatbot is required to return only the tag for the word's part of speech, and \"VBD\" represents a \"Verb, past tense,\" which is consistent with how the chatbot is expected to respond. The output does not include anything other than the part-of-speech tag, which complies with the requirement to return just the tag. There is no additional or missing information in the output since I am checking only for compliance and not correctness.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
