The task is to return a part of speech tag corresponding to the word presented in the given sentence. The output complies with the requirement to return only the part of speech tag. There are no additional elements or extraneous information present. Therefore, the output adheres to the guideline of returning just the tag. Since the input is not provided, I am not able to determine if 'RB' is functionally correct, but that does not affect compliance as described in the guidelines.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
