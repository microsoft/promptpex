  "validityText": "The task is to determine if the given input complies with the provided input specification. The specification requires two elements: a sentence and a word from that sentence.\n\n1. The sentence provided is: \"They discovered a 'zibble' in the forest.\"\n2. The word provided is: \"zibble\"\n\nTo evaluate compliance:\n- First, the sentence can be of any length and can contain any combination of words, numbers, symbols, or foreign words. The given sentence, \"They discovered a 'zibble' in the forest.\", meets these criteria as it consists of words and symbols.\n- Second, the word provided must be present in the sentence. The word \"zibble\" is indeed present within the sentence as 'zibble', which implies the presence of the word \"zibble\" within the quotation marks.\n\nThus, both elements of the input specification are satisfied: the sentence is valid per the described conditions, and the word is present within the sentence. There are no violations.\n\nOK",
