  "validityText": "The input consists of a sentence and a word. The sentence provided is 'She had many dreams.', and the word is 'had'. \n\nFirst, according to the specification, the sentence can contain any combination of words, numbers, symbols, or foreign words, so there are no restrictions on the content or structure of the sentence, which means the sentence 'She had many dreams.' complies with the input specification as it is valid and acceptable.\n\nSecond, the word 'had' is explicitly part of the sentence 'She had many dreams.' Therefore it meets the requirement that the word must be a word present in the sentence.\n\nBoth components of the input—the sentence and the word—comply with the input specification, and no rules are violated.\n\nOK",
