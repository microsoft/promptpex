The sentence is 'She sings beautifully.' and the word is 'beautifully'.\n\n- The first requirement of the input specification states that the input must include a sentence of any length containing any combination of words, numbers, symbols, or foreign words. The given sentence, \"She sings beautifully.\" meets these criteria as it is a sentence of a reasonable length, comprised of words and a punctuation mark.\n\n- The second requirement states that a word from this sentence must be provided. The provided word is 'beautifully'.\n\n- The final requirement is that the word must be present in the sentence. The word 'beautifully' is indeed part of the sentence 'She sings beautifully.'\n\nThe input complies with the input specification because the sentence is correctly constructed and the word is explicitly present in the sentence. No parts of the specification have been violated.\n\nOK",
