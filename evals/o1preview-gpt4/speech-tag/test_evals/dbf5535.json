According to the specification, the word must be present in the sentence. In this case, the word 'Qwertz' is indeed present within the sentence, within quotes but that is not a problem since the specification does not restrict characters around words. There are no specified restrictions on the length or combination of elements within the sentence, so these are also compliant. Thus, the input follows all the given rules without violation.\n\nOK",
