  "validityText": "The evaluation of the given input against the specification is as follows:\n\n1. The sentence provided is: \"I can't decide whether to desert or not.\" This sentence can be said to adhere to the input specification as it doesn't impose restrictions on the length, type, or content of the sentence, so the presence of contractions, punctuation, or the uncertainty expressed doesn't violate any specified rule.\n\n2. The word provided is: \"desert\". We now must verify if this word is indeed present in the given sentence. When we examine the sentence, \"I can't decide whether to desert or not,\" we see that the word \"desert\" is present exactly as stated in the sentence.\n\n3. There is no part of the input that violates the specification because the word given indeed occurs in the sentence, satisfying the requirement that \"The word must be a word present in the sentence.\"\n\nSince both conditions in the input specification are satisfied — i.e., the sentence can be any combination of words and the given word is part of that sentence — the input complies with the input specification.\n\nOK",
