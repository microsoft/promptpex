  "validityText": "The input consists of two parts: a sentence and a word from that sentence. The sentence is 'Wow! That was amazing!' and the word is 'Wow'. To determine if the input complies with the specification, I need to verify:\n\n1. The sentence must be of any length and can contain any combination of words, numbers, symbols, or foreign words. The sentence provided is valid as it contains a combination of an exclamation mark, words, and spacing, fitting the criteria given.\n\n2. The word must be a word present in the sentence. The specified word \"Wow\" is indeed present within the sentence \"Wow! That was amazing!\". The presence of the word \"Wow\" in the sentence is crucial to meeting this requirement.\n\nBased on this analysis, both parts of the input satisfy the requirements stipulated in the input specification, as the sentence follows the structure of containing any characters, and the word is directly part of the sentence.\n\nTherefore, this input complies with the specification.\n\nOK",
