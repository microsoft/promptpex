According to the description, \"PRP$\" stands for \"Possessive pronoun\" while \"He\" is generally a \"Personal pronoun\" which is tagged as \"PRP\". The task is to return only the part of speech tag for the given word, ensuring it matches one of the tags listed in the description or otherwise return \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\" as specified. Since \"PRP$\" is not the correct tag for \"He\", this suggests non-compliance since the tag does not appropriately match the typical classification for the word based on the description provided.\n\nThere is a violation as the word \"He\" is misclassified with the tag \"PRP$\". \n\nERR"
