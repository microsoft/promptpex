  "complianceText": "The output provided by the chatbot lists several part-of-speech tags and also includes extra information in parentheses for the second point: \"* although it's a coordinating conjunction in this case, I will list it as a Determiner to maintain the original format\". According to the description, the chatbot is supposed to return only the part-of-speech tag. Any additional information or reasoning goes against the guideline which specifies returning only the part of speech tag and not elaborating further. The second point also indicates a non-compliance as it mentions changing the part of speech tag to maintain format, which is not in accordance with the task description. The task is not about maintaining any format but specifically tagging with the accurate part of speech.\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
