According to the description, the expected output is just the part of speech tag, without any additional explanations or parenthetical references. The description specifies that \"IN\" stands for \"Preposition or subordinating conjunction\". The inclusion of \"(Institutional Noun)\" is not part of what the chatbot should return and deviates from the defined tags. As such, the output does not comply with the chatbot description.\n\nViolation: The output includes additional text \"(Institutional Noun)\" alongside the part of speech tag, which is not allowed according to the description. The description specifies that only the tag should be returned.\n\nERR"
