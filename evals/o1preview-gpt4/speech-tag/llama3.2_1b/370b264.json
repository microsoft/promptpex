The output provides part-of-speech tags preceded by the label \"CC,\" which actually stands for \"Coordinating conjunction.\" However, the actual parts of speech provided for the words, namely \"Adjective\" and \"Noun,\" do not correlate with the \"CC\" tag. The output should directly provide the correct part-of-speech tag from the list given in the description, with no additional labels or descriptions. Also, each word should be tagged individually and properly according to one of the specified tags or returned as \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\" if applicable.\n\nTherefore, the 'CC' label and the addition of \"Adjective\" and \"Noun\" explanations deviate from the format and requirements laid out in the description.\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
