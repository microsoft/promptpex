  "complianceText": "The chatbot output should return just a single part of speech tag for the given word. Directly, the output was supposed to return a simple POS tag matching the input word's part of speech, or 'Unknown', or 'CantAnswer'. The provided response appears to include more tags or responses than what is necessary for a single detection. Additionally, the output lists tags that are not part of the specified guidelines, such as \"JD\" and \"JB,\" which are not recognized part-of-speech tags specified in the given description. This makes the output non-compliant with the adherence to the POS tags provided in the description.\n\nFurthermore, the format includes multiple lines and additional information instead of simply returning one of the stipulated possibilities (a single tag, Unknown, or CantAnswer).\n\nTherefore, due to the presence of non-listed tags (\"JD\" and \"JB\") and the format not aligning with the expected output, this response is non-compliant with the task description.\n\nERR"
