  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output provides tags for each word in a list form, which does not comply with the description that mentions returning only the part of speech tag for a given word. Additionally, the tags provided do not strictly adhere to the list of tags specified in the description. For instance, \"Possessive noun (PRP$)\" is incorrectly labeled, and \"later\" has two incorrect tags \"Prepositional phrase (NP)\" and \"Determiner (DT)-Preposition\", neither of which are in the listed tags. The description requires returning only one part of speech tag or using \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\" when applicable, not producing a list of tags with explanations.\n\nThe key violation here is that instead of providing just a single part of speech tag for each word, a list with additional explanations are provided which is contrary to the directive of returning only the part of speech tag. This excessive information goes beyond the task requirements and violates the description's guidelines.\n\nERR"
