However, in this case, the output includes additional information such as \"Word CC: Coordinating conjunction\" and \"Word VB: Verb,\" which are not the tags but rather explanations of the tags. Additionally, the output incorrectly provides a concluding statement with \"we can return: Both Unknown,\" which deviates from the requirement to return just the tag.\n\nThe correct output format should only contain the tag itself, or if the word cannot be tagged or the chatbot is unable to tag it, a single \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer.\" Therefore, the inclusion of additional text and statements constitutes a violation.\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
