  "complianceText": "The chatbot output provides part-of-speech tagging information for a given word \"zibble\". In Sentence 1, it assigns the tag \"NN (Noun)\". In Sentence 2, it states that the word can also be tagged but labels it as \"unknown\" because it's not in a recognized category.\n\nIn the description, it specifies that the output should only be the part-of-speech tag or one of the words \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer,\" without additional information or explanation. The output violates this because it includes unnecessary additional details and explanations in both sentences, whereas it should only state \"NN\" or \"Unknown\" for Sentence 2, or choose the most appropriate response among \"Unknown\" and \"CantAnswer.\"\n\nMentioning \"can also be tagged\" without a concise tag violates the requirement for returning just the tag in case of recognized categories or \"Unknown,\"\"CantAnswer\" otherwise. The excess wording and complexity make it non-compliant.\n\nERR"
