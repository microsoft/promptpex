The description specifies that only the part of speech tag should be returned, but the chatbot includes additional text and reasoning. Additionally, the part of speech tags provided are JJR and JJS, not JK. The tags \"JJR\" and \"JJS\" are already known, but they do not correspond to \"JK\" as the output improperly specifies. The description also offers the option to return \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\" if an appropriate tag cannot be determined, but the chatbot does not make use of this option. \n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
