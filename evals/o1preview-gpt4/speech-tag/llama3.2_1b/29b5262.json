  "complianceText": "The chatbot output contains three responses. The first response \"CC: IN\" does not comply with the description as the rules specify that the output should be a single part of speech tag. The intended format should return only the tag, \"CC\" or \"IN\" in this case, not both combined; hence, it's incorrect according to the compliance rules.\n\nThe next two outputs, \"CantAnswer,\" are in compliance given that Description explicitly states that if the chatbot cannot tag a word, it should return \"CantAnswer.\"\n\nSince the first line deviates from the requirement to return a single tag or one of the special cases \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer,\" the output overall does not comply with the description.\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
