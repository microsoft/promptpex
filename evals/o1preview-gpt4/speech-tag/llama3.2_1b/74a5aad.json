  "complianceText": "The chatbot output includes a word \"gave\" followed by \"CC: Main verb\" and an additional note. According to the provided chatbot description, the task requires returning only the part of speech tag for the given word without additional explanations, notes, or descriptions. The output \"CC: Main verb\" does not comply with the expectation of returning only the part of speech tag. Additionally, \"CC\" stands for Coordinating conjunction according to the description, but \"gave\" is presented as a main verb, which typically would not be tagged as a Coordinating conjunction (CC) based on standard parts of speech tags given in the description. Hence these factors indicate non-compliance with returning a tag or correctly representing some of the part of speech aspects.\n\nTherefore, the chatbot's output does not meet the requirement of returning just the appropriate part of speech tag, resulting in a violation.\n\nERR"
