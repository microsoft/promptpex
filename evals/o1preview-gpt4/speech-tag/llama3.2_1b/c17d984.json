  "complianceText": "The chatbot output provides the tag \"Unknown,\" which is acceptable since it might be that \"blork\" is not a standard English word that fits the listed part of speech tags. This is compliant with the instructions given that if a word cannot be tagged with the listed tags, the chatbot should return \"Unknown.\" Additionally, the output does not contain any extraneous information as the tag itself is provided correctly as per the requirement to return only the part of speech tag. Therefore, the output complies with the chatbot description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
