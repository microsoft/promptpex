  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output displays the same sentence and part of speech tag, \"IN\", twice. According to the description, the output should only include a single tag for the given word's part of speech. There is no provision in the description for providing multiple identical outputs for a given sentence, especially when it is formatted to include the sentence itself which seems redundant. Thus, this appears to violate the requirement to \"Return only the part of speech tag.\" Without knowledge of the input, it is not possible to determine whether the tag \"IN\" is correct. However, the issue of formatting and redundancy remains.\n\nERR"
