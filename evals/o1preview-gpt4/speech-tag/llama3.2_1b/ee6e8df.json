The output is expected to contain only one part of speech tag or \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\" for the given word. However, the output contains multiple tags: \"CC: NNP\" and \"VB: verb, VBD: Verb, past tense\" which is not compliant with the description of returning only a single part of speech tag. \n\n2. The format of the output is incorrect. According to the description, the output should be just the tag or \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\", but here additional text like \"verb, VBD: Verb, past tense\" is provided. \n\nThese issues indicate that the output does not comply with the requirement of providing a singular part of speech tag without additional text.\n\nERR"
