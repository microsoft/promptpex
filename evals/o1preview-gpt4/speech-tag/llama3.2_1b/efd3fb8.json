However, the output contains additional information such as \"Here are the results\" and the detailed list that includes the word preceded by \"Word:\" within asterisks, which is not compliant with the requirement to only return the part of speech tag. The output provides the part of speech tag \"JJR\" for both appearances of the word \"faster\", which means it might be functionally correct, but this goes beyond the compliance check as it is not relevant considering the lack of input. The main issue is that the format does not follow the requirement of returning only the tag as described. \n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
