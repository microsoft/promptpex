The output should only feature the part of speech tag for a given word, and if the word cannot be tagged with the listed tags, the output should be \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer.\" \n\nIn the output provided, \"Word: CC\" is present, which aligns with the requirement to return a part of speech tag if the word can be matched with one. However, there is an additional sentence \"Sentence: They won easily.\" which is information beyond the required part of speech tag. The description specifically instructs to return only the tag. Hence, including a sentence is extraneous and implies non-compliance.\n\nTherefore, the output violates the guideline of returning only the part of speech tag by including unnecessary additional information (the sentence).\n\nERR"
