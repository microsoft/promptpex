The correct compliance should only include the tag without additional characters. The addition of another \"CC\" after the colon is invalid based solely on the requirements that say to return only the tag.\n\n2. \"CBTZ: Cautious non-3rd person singular present (possessive wh-pronoun) Unknown\": \"CBTZ\" is not a part of the list of specified tags and \"Cautious non-3rd person singular present (possessive wh-pronoun)\" is not a valid description for any tag in the list. According to the given rules, if the word cannot be tagged with the listed tags, it should return \"Unknown\". Therefore, it violates the rules by not adhering strictly to the list of tags or the term \"Unknown\". Moreover, the format does not comply with returning solely the tag.\n\nDue to these violations, the output does not comply with the description.\n\nERR"
