  "complianceText": "The chatbot output suggests that the word 'running' is tagged as 'JJ', which means it is tagged as an adjective. The output provides only the part of speech tag 'JJ'. There is no violation in terms of returning only the tag, as required. Additionally, the description states if the word cannot be tagged with the listed tags to return 'Unknown' or 'CantAnswer', but without knowing the input sentence, we cannot determine if adjective is the correct or incorrect tag. Therefore, the focus here is solely checking if the tag is provided in the correct format, which it is.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
