  "complianceText": "The chatbot output includes three paragraphs, each wrapped in `<p>` tags, which is a requirement of the description. The first two paragraphs contain `<strong>` tags, satisfying the criterion of including one `<strong>` tag in each `<p>`. However, the third paragraph lacks a `<strong>` tag, violating the requirement of having one `<strong>` tag inside each `<p>`. Additionally, the `<em>` tag is used in the second paragraph, but not in the first and third, despite the requirement of having multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize key words and phrases inside each `<p>`. The use of asterisks as emphasis markers is not specified in the task description and can be considered non-compliant. Therefore, there are violations regarding the use of `<strong>` and `<em>` tags inside each paragraph.\n\nERR"
