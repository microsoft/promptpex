  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is meant to format a paragraph of text into HTML, splitting it into individual sentences and wrapping each sentence with a `<p>` tag. Additionally, each `<p>` tag should contain one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize key words and phrases.\n\n1. **Count of `<p>` tags**: The output has three `<p>` tags, which fulfills the requirement of having at least three `<p>` tags.\n\n2. **Use of `<strong>` and `<em>` tags**:\n   - In the first `<p>` tag, there is one `<strong>` tag and two `<em>` tags, fulfilling the requirement.\n   - The second `<p>` tag contains no `<strong>` tag and two `<em>` tags, which violates the requirement of containing one `<strong>` tag in each `<p>` tag.\n   - The third `<p>` tag has one `<strong>` tag and one `<em>` tag, fulfilling the requirement.\n\nThe output violates the rule that states each `<p>` tag should have one `<strong>` tag, as the second `<p>` tag lacks a `<strong>` tag. This discrepancy is a clear reason why the output does not comply with the description.\n\nERR"
