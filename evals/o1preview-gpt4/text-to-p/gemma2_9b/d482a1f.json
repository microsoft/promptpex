Each of the first two `<p>` tags contains one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags, which adheres to the formatting instructions. However, the third `<p>` tag does not contain a `<strong>` tag, violating the requirement that each paragraph should include one `<strong>` tag.\n\nThe non-compliance is due to the missing `<strong>` tag in the third paragraph, which was required according to the description. This lack of a `<strong>` tag is clearly against the stated requirements for formatting each paragraph.\n\nERR"
