  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output includes three sentences, each wrapped in a <p> tag, which complies with the requirement of having at least three <p> tags. Additionally, each <p> tag contains one <strong> tag, aligning with the specification. However, there is an issue with the emphasis part: the second <p> tag includes \"_sea_\" instead of using the correct <em> tags for emphasis. This violates the requirement to use <em> tags to emphasize key words and phrases.\n\nTherefore, due to the incorrect use of emphasis in the second <p> tag, the output does not fully comply with the chatbot description.\n\nERR"
