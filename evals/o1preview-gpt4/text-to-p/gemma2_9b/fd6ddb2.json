There are indeed three `<p>` tags, meeting the requirement of at least three. \n\nInside each `<p>` tag, at least one `<strong>` tag is present, and there are also multiple `<em>` tags used to emphasize key words or phrases. Thus, the use of `<strong>` and `<em>` tags conforms to the description.\n\nSince all the requirements are satisfied specific to the output given, I find no violations of the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
