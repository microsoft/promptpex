  "complianceText": "The chatbot output contains the following elements:\n\n1. It is comprised of three `<p>` tags, meeting the minimum requirement specified in the description.\n2. Each `<p>` tag contains one `<strong>` tag. This directly aligns with the requirement to include one `<strong>` tag inside each `<p>` tag.\n3. Multiple `<em>` tags are present inside each `<p>` tag. The description specifies that there should be multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize key words and phrases, which has been accomplished in the output.\n\nThe evaluation does not require checking for correctness of the split into sentences or whether the emphasized words are accurate since such evaluation would necessitate knowing the original input. All visible aspects of the chatbot output comply directly with the description requirements that can be assessed without input knowledge.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
