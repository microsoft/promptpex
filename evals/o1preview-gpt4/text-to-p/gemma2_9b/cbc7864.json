In this output, there are indeed three `<p>` tags present, satisfying this requirement.\n\n3. **Inclusion of `<strong>` and `<em>` Tags**: Each of the `<p>` tags includes at least one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags, which aligns with the requirement to emphasize key words and phrases within sentences using these tags.\n\nConsidering the above points, the output complies with the description. There are no violations identified in terms of structure and usage of tags as prescribed by the given rules (focusing exclusively on compliance, not correctness).\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
