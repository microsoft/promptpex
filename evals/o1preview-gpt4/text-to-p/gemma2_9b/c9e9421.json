Split the paragraph into individual sentences and wrapped each sentence in a `<p>` tag. \n2. Ensured there are at least three `<p>` tags, which is evident in the output since each sentence has its own `<p>` tag.\n3. Included one `<strong>` tag inside a `<p>` tag to emphasize a keyword, which is visible in the first paragraph where \"Photosynthesis\" is emphasized.\n4. Incorporated multiple `<em>` tags inside each `<p>` tag to emphasize other key words and phrases, as can be seen with the words \"green plants,\" \"food\", \"sunlight\", \"chemical energy\", \"Oxygen\", and \"byproduct\".\n   \nBased on the above analysis, there is no detected violation of the chatbot description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
