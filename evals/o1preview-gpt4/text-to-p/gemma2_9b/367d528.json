  "complianceText": "The chatbot output has the following issues that violate the description:\n\n1. The use of the <strong> tag is inconsistent. In the first sentence, the <strong> tag is used correctly, but in the third sentence, the <strong> tag is not properly closed. It spans across two different words and overlaps with a non-standard **symbol, indicating a syntax error. There's also a ** used to presumably indicate emphasis, which is not correct HTML usage.\n\n2. There are inconsistencies in the HTML syntax. For example, the closing <strong> tag is missing in \"<strong>greatest **scientists <em >of all time</em>\". Here, the correct closing tag for <strong> is </strong>, but it's improperly used alongside asterisks without proper syntax, causing HTML syntax issues.\n\n3. The second sentence contains <strong> wrongly replaced by asterisks, which is not complying with the description requirement to use <strong> tags.\n\nOverall, the output does not fully comply with the requirements of wrapping each sentence in proper and consistent HTML tags, specifically the <strong> and <em> tags. The improper syntax and usage mark violation against the description provided.\n\nERR"
