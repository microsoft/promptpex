The output contains three separate `<p>` tags, which meets the requirement of having at least three `<p>` tags.\n\n2. Each `<p>` tag includes a `<strong>` tag as specified for emphasizing key words and phrases:\n   - The first `<p>` tag contains `<strong>Ocean</strong>` and `<strong>loudly</strong>`.\n   - The second `<p>` tag contains `<strong>sun</strong>` and `<strong>beautifully</strong>`.\n   - The third `<p>` tag contains `<strong>Stars</strong>`.\n\n3. The output includes `<em>` tags to emphasize certain words within the sentences:\n   - The first `<p>` tag contains `<em>waves</em>`.\n   - The third `<p>` tag contains `<em style =\"color:yellow\">brightly</em>`.\n\nHowever, the second `<p>` tag does not contain any `<em>` tags, which does not comply with the requirement that each `<p>` tag should have multiple `<em>` tags. Each `<p>` should ideally contain multiple `<em>` tags as per the description, although the exact number or balance between `<strong>` and `<em>` tags might require knowing the input, it is explicitly stated that each `<p>` should have multiple `<em>` tags.\n\nReason for violation: The second `<p>` tag lacks any `<em>` tags, which violates the requirement for the presence of multiple `<em>` tags inside each `<p>` tag.\n\nERR"
