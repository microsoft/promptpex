This aligns with the requirement to split the paragraph into individual sentences and wrap them with `<p>` tags, and also meets the requirement of having at least three `<p>` tags.\n\n2. **Use of `<strong>` and `<em>` Tags**: Within each `<p>` tag, there is the use of one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize key words and phrases. This follows the stipulation to include one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags to highlight key elements inside each sentence.\n\nThe chatbot's output adheres to the formatting rules mentioned in the description. Additionally, the output ends with a sentence offering further options which does not affect compliance to the description provided.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
