Inside each `<p>` tag, there is at least one `<strong>` tag, which also complies with the description. However, while the use of `<em>` tags is correct, the use of `<span>` tags violates the description, as there should only be `<strong>` and `<em>` tags to emphasize key words and phrases. The presence of `<span>` tags in each `<p>` tag is not in compliance with the description, which clearly states only the use of `<strong>` and `<em>` tags. Therefore, the output does not fully comply with the description.\n\nERR"
