Additionally, the output contains both <strong> and <em> tags, as requested by the task description. However, not all sentences contain at least one <strong> and multiple <em> tags.\n\n- In the first <p> tag, the sentence \"The Great Wall of China is visible from space.\" contains both <strong> tags (around \"The\" and \"space\") and <em> tags (around \"Great Wall\" and \"China\"), which is compliant.\n\n- In the second <p> tag, the sentence \"It was _built_ to protect against invasions.\" does not contain any <strong> tags at all, which violates the requirement that each sentence should have at least one <strong> tag.\n\n- In the third <p> tag, the sentence \"It stretches over 13,000 _miles_.\" is completely unwrapped in any special tags. While the text contains underscores, those are not converted into emphasized tags, violating the requirement of at least one <strong> and multiple <em> tags in the sentence.\n\nGiven these non-compliances with the descriptions concerning the placement of <strong> tags and lack of <em> tags in the last sentence, the chatbot output does not fully adhere to the task description.\n\nERR"
