  "validityText": "The input is a paragraph that discusses the Pythagorean theorem. To determine compliance with the input specification, we need to check if there are at least three sentences. Upon examination:\n1. \"In mathematics, the Pythagorean theorem relates the sides of a right triangle.\" - Sentence 1\n2. \"It states that a² + b² = c².\" - Sentence 2\n3. \"This theorem is fundamental in geometry.\" - Sentence 3\n\nThe input indeed contains three sentences, thereby meeting the requirement of containing at least three sentences. There are no additional specifications about content or structure beyond this, so it complies with the input specification.\n\nOK",
