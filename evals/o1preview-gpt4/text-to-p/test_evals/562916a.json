  "validityText": "The input consists of text that appears to be a series of short statements. According to the input specification, the input must be a paragraph of text containing at least three sentences. \n\n1. **Evaluating the Structure**: The input provided consists of three statements: \"Friendship strengthens bonds.\", \"Trust builds relationships.\", and \"Support fosters growth.\" Each statement is separated by a period, which typically denotes the end of a sentence. Therefore, structurally, it meets the requirement of containing at least three sentences.\n\n2. **Evaluating Paragraph Requirement**: The input specification also states that the input should be a \"paragraph.\" A paragraph is typically a group of sentences that discuss a single topic or idea. The three sentences in the input are related as they all focus on positive aspects of relationships, suggesting that they could form a coherent paragraph discussing the theme of building strong relationships.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, the input complies with the given input specification since it contains three sentences and can be interpreted as a paragraph discussing the topic of relationships.\n\nOK",
