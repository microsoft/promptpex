The input provided is: \n   - \"Challenges develop skills.\"\n   - \"Overcoming builds confidence.\"\n   - \"Success follows effort.\"\n   \n   It indeed contains three sentences based on the presence of periods marking the end of each sentence.\n\nSince both conditions of the specification are met—it's a paragraph of text with at least three sentences—there are no violations of the input specification.\n\nOK",
