  "validityText": "The task is to determine whether the input is a valid paragraph of text and contains at least three sentences.\n\nFirstly, let's evaluate whether the input constitutes a paragraph. A paragraph is typically a series of related sentences discussing a single idea or topic. The input consists of three related sentences all describing nature and its elements, logically linking them together into a coherent paragraph.\n\nNext, we assess the requirement of having at least three sentences. The input is composed of three distinct sentences:\n1. \"Ocean waves crash loudly.\"\n2. \"The sun sets beautifully.\"\n3. \"Stars shine brightly.\"\n\nEach of these sentences is complete, containing a subject and predicate, and they are separated by periods. Therefore, the input meets this specification.\n\nSince the input meets both conditions outlined in the specification, there is no violation.\n\nOK",
