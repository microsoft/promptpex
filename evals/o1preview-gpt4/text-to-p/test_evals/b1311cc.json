  "validityText": "To evaluate the given input against the input specification, I must determine if it meets the requirement of containing at least three sentences. The provided input is as follows: \"Computers calculate quickly. Algorithms solve problems. Code runs applications.\"\n\n1. The input consists of three distinct statements:\n   - \"Computers calculate quickly.\"\n   - \"Algorithms solve problems.\"\n   - \"Code runs applications.\"\n   \n2. Each statement ends with a period (.), which indicates that each is a separate sentence.\n\n3. Based on the input specification, which requires the input to be a paragraph containing at least three sentences, the input meets this criterion as it contains exactly three sentences.\n\nGiven these points, there is no violation of the input specification.\n\nOK",
