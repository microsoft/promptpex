  "validityText": "Given the input, I need to determine if it meets the input specification. The specification requires that the input be a paragraph of text containing at least three sentences.\n\n1. First, I will check the structure of the input to confirm it is a paragraph. The input provided is a block of text without line breaks, complying with the paragraph definition in a general sense.\n\n2. Next, I need to verify that the input contains at least three sentences. To do this, I identify sentence-ending punctuation marks, typically a period (.), exclamation mark (!), or question mark (?). In this input: \n   - \"Mathematics is universal.\"\n   - \"Equations describe reality.\"\n   - \"Numbers reveal patterns.\"\n\nThere are clearly three distinct sentences, each ending with a period. This satisfies the requirement of having at least three sentences.\n\nTherefore, the given input complies with all parts of the input specification, as it is structured as a paragraph and contains the requisite number of sentences.\n\nOK",
