  "validityText": "The input provides a series of instructions related to cooking or baking. Let's evaluate it based on the input specification provided, which requires that the input be a paragraph of text containing at least three sentences.\n\nUpon examining the input:\n\n1. **Paragraph Requirement**: A paragraph is typically a collection of sentences related to a single idea. The instructions provided are indeed focused on a single process, suggesting they form a cohesive paragraph.\n\n2. **Sentence Count**: The input contains three distinct sentences:\n   - \"First, mix the flour and sugar together.\"\n   - \"Then, add the eggs and milk.\"\n   - \"Bake the mixture for 30 minutes.\"\n\nEach of these statements ends with a period, indicating that they are complete sentences. The input thus satisfies the minimum requirement of containing at least three sentences.\n\nNo violations of the specification have been identified, as the input is indeed a paragraph containing three sentences. \n\nOK",
