  "validityText": "The input specification requires the input to be a paragraph of text containing at least three sentences. \n\nI will first identify whether the input is formatted as a paragraph and whether it contains the requisite number of sentences. The input provided is: \"Technology evolves rapidly. Adaptation is essential. Continuous learning leads to success.\"\n\n1. **Paragraph Format**: The input is presented as a continuous block of text without line breaks that would suggest separate paragraphs, which qualifies it as a paragraph.\n\n2. **Sentence Count**: The input contains three distinct sentences:\n   - \"Technology evolves rapidly.\"\n   - \"Adaptation is essential.\"\n   - \"Continuous learning leads to success.\"\n\nBased on the input specification, the paragraph format requirement and the minimum sentence count requirement are both met by the given input.\n\nNo violations are detected as the input complies with both criteria set by the input specification.\n\nOK",
