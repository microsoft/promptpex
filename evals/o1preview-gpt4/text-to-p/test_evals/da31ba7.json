The provided input consists of the following sentences:\n\n1. \"Exercise improves health.\"\n2. \"Nutrition fuels the body.\"\n3. \"Sleep restores energy.\"\n4. \"Balance is key.\"\n\nThis input clearly contains four sentences, each ending with a period and constituting a complete thought. Therefore, it satisfies the requirement of containing at least three sentences. Additionally, the input does form a paragraph of text, with the sentences proposing related ideas around health and wellbeing, which together create a small but complete paragraph according to the broad definition often applied to short input or prompts like this.\n\nThere are no violations of the input specification detected.\n\nOK",
