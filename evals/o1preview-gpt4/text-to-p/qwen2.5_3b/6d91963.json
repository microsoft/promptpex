Additionally, within each `<p>` tag, there should be one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags included.\n\nEvaluating the given output:\n\n1. The output has three `<p>` tags, in compliance with the rule that the answer should have at least three `<p>` tags.\n\n2. The first `<p>` tag contains one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags, which fulfill the requirement.\n\n3. The second `<p>` tag contains no `<strong>` tag and only one `<em>` tag. This violates the requirement of having one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags per `<p>`.\n\n4. The third `<p>` tag contains no `<strong>` tag and one `<em>` tag, also violating the same requirement as the second `<p>`.\n\nThe violation lies in the second and third `<p>` tags not meeting the requirement of containing one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags.\n\nERR"
