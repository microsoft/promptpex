  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not comply with the description in the following ways: \n\n1. There are multiple instances where text is not wrapped correctly with `<p>` tags. Specifically, the sentence \"It states that a² + b² = c².\" is not enclosed in `<p>` tags. All sentences should be individually wrapped in `<p>` tags.\n\n2. Although there are more than three `<p>` tags, the sentence wrapping within the output is not consistent where standalone sentences are mixed within multiple paragraph elements. Some sentences appear to be combined within the same `<p>` tag when they should be separated, violating the requirement that each sentence should be wrapped with its own `<p>` tag.\n\n3. It appears that there is some repetitive content, with certain sentences repeated but considering the absence of input, this repetitive content cannot be fact-checked for correctness and has been ignored.\n\n4. There are `<strong>` and `<em>` tags present, which comply with part of the requirement, but there must be at least one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags inside each individual `<p>` tag, not scattered outside of it or between `<p>` tags.\n\nDue to the above reasons, the output does not meet the guideline of wrapping each sentence individually within `<p>` tags and properly placing `<strong>` and `<em>` tags in accordance with those `<p>` structures.  \n\nERR"
