  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output does not comply with the description in several ways. Firstly, the description specifies that the output should have at least three <p> tags. However, the output provided contains only two <p> tags. Secondly, while each sentence inside the <p> tags should include one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags, both <p> tags in the output don't follow a structure where <strong> and <em> tags are distinctly used per sentence, rather they seem to only emphasize specific words and phrases without clear distinction between different sentences. Due to these reasons, the output does not comply with the given description.\n\nERR"
