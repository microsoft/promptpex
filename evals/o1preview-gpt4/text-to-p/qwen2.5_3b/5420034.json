Inside each <p> tag, there is one <strong> tag used, which aligns with the guideline. Additionally, each sentence contains at least one <em> tag to emphasize key words or phrases within the sentence. This satisfies the requirement of using multiple <em> tags, although each sentence uses only one, this seems to satisfy the guideline as it mentions the usage of multiple <em> tags, not a specific number per sentence.\n\nThere are no violations in terms of compliance with the description provided, based on the elements present in the output. \n\nOK"
