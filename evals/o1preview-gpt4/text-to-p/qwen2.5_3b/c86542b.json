  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output contains three <p> tags, meeting the requirement of having at least three <p> tags in total. However, each <p> tag contains the exact same content repeated, which suggests that the chatbot has not split the paragraph into individual sentences before wrapping each sentence with a <p> tag. Instead, each <p> tag encloses an entire paragraph. The description specifies that paragraphs should be split into individual sentences, and each sentence should be wrapped in a separate <p> tag. Since the output does not reflect this requirement, it does not comply with the chatbot description. \n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
