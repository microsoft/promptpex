  "complianceText": "The description specifies that each sentence should be wrapped in a separate `<p>` tag. However, the chatbot's output has the same set of sentences repeated inside three different `<p>` tags completely without splitting into individual sentences. Furthermore, each `<p>` tag should contain at least one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags, which is complied with in the output. Despite this, not splitting the paragraph into individual sentences violates the specification. Hence, the non-compliance is due to the entire paragraph being repeated within each `<p>` tag without sentence separation.\n\nThe output does contain at least three `<p>` tags, satisfies the requirement for having `<strong>` and `<em>` tags, but fails in splitting the text into individual sentences.\n\nERR"
