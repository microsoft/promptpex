The first sentence contains a <strong> tag, which is correct. Additionally, <em> tags are used in the first two sentences to emphasize key words and phrases. Although the third sentence lacks <em> tags, the description does not mandate that every sentence have them, only that multiple <em> tags are included. Therefore, the presence of <em> tags in the output is in line with the description, and there are multiple <em> tags in the second sentence as well. Since all specified requirements within the scope of the evaluation can be considered met, the output complies with the description provided.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
