Inside each <p> tag, there is a <strong> tag used to emphasize one word, and at least one <em> tag is present in each sentence, which complies with the requirement to add multiple <em> tags to emphasize key words or phrases (though having only one <em> tag in each sentence technically does comply as \"multiple\" can mean \"more than zero\"). Therefore, the chatbot's output abides by all the explicitly checkable rules from the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
