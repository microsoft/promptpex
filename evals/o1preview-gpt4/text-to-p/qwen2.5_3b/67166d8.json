According to the description, the paragraph should be split into individual sentences, and each sentence must be wrapped with a `<p>` tag. Additionally, within each `<p>` tag, there should be one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize key words and phrases. Furthermore, the output must contain at least three `<p>` tags.\n\nUpon evaluation, the output contains only two `<p>` tags, which is a direct violation of the requirement that the answer should have at least three `<p>` tags. While the `<strong>` and `<em>` tags are used correctly within the `<p>` tags, the failure to meet the minimum number of `<p>` tags required leads to non-compliance with the chatbot description.\n\nERR"
