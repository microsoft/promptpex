Inside each `<p>` tag, there are `<strong>` tags present, in line with the requirement to use `<strong>` tags to emphasize key words. Additionally, the second `<p>` tag contains `<em>` tags to emphasize key words or phrases, which is also compliant with the guidelines.\n\nWhile not all `<p>` tags have `<em>` tags, the description does not explicitly state that every `<p>` tag must have `<em>` tags, only that there should be multiple `<em>` tags used. The second `<p>` tag contains multiple `<em>` tags, meeting this requirement. The `<strong>` and `<em>` tags have been used appropriately according to the instruction. Therefore, there are no non-compliances with the provided chatbot description based on the output.\n\nNo violation. \nOK"
