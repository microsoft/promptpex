  "complianceText": "The evaluation of the output focuses on adherence to the description's requirements:\n\n1. The output contains three `<p>` tags, which satisfies the requirement of having at least three `<p>` tags.\n2. Each `<p>` tag contains at least one `<strong>` tag to emphasize certain keywords. Specifically:\n   - The first `<p>` tag includes two `<strong>` tags around \"For\" and \"cups.\"\n   - The second `<p>` tag includes two `<strong>` tags around \"sugar\" and \"baking powder.\"\n   - The third `<p>` tag does not contain any `<strong>` tags. This violates the requirement since each sentence should contain a `<strong>` tag.\n3. Multiple `<em>` tags are used to emphasize key words and phrases across the sentences. Although the third `<p>` tag does not have `<em>` tags, the requirement for `<em>` tags is that they should be used for key words and phrases, and this is subjective without knowing the input. Therefore, we can't evaluate this aspect fully without the input.\n\nThe specific violation here is the absence of a `<strong>` tag in the third `<p>` tag. Based on the description, every sentence should have at least one `<strong>` tag.\n\nERR"
