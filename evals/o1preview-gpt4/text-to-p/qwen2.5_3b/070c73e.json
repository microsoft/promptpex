  "complianceText": "The chatbot output consists of three `<p>` tags, which complies with the requirement to have at least three `<p>` tags. However, the content inside each `<p>` tag does not comply with the requirement to split the paragraph into individual sentences and wrap each sentence with a `<p>` tag because it simply repeats the same content in each tag. Furthermore, the structure inside each `<p>` tag is not correct because it wraps `<strong>` tags inside `<em>` tags, whereas the description asks for one `<strong>` tag per `<p>` and multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize keywords or phrases. There is no demonstration of wrapping sentences individually or properly nesting tags. \n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
