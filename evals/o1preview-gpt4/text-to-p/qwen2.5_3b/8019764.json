  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not comply with the description for the following reasons:\n\n1. **HTML Structure Issues**: The HTML code provided by the chatbot includes malformed tags, such as `<em<preparation><br /></em></preparation>` and `<span class='highlight'>`, which disrupt the HTML's standard structure. The `<em<preparation></preparation>` tag is incorrectly structured, and the span tag with a class which seems to be more related to CSS, should not be included in this format. Proper HTML syntax is crucial for compliance.\n\n2. **Inconsistent & Incorrect Use of Tags**: The nested `<preparation>` and `<span class='highlight'>` elements are incorrectly used within the HTML structure. The description specifies to use `<em>` and `<strong>` tags, and these elements do not align with the expectation outlined in the description, leading to non-compliance issues.\n\n3. **Duplicate Paragraphs**: The content of the paragraphs seems to be duplicated with minor variations in tag malformations and order. Proper splitting and formatting should result in unique paragraph structures, based on the input provided, which is not available for evaluation leading to confusion but is detectable in the consistency of tags and HTML formatting.\n\nGiven these points, the output violates the compliance requirements as specified in the description.\n\nERR"
