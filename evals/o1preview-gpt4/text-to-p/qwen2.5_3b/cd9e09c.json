  "complianceText": "The evaluation of the chatbot output is as follows:\n\n1. The chatbot output should contain at least three `<p>` tags as per the description. However, the output provided contains only two `<p>` tags. This directly violates the rule specified in the description that states \"Your answer should have at least three `<p>` tags.\" \n\n2. Each `<p>` tag in the output contains a `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags, which complies with the requirement that each sentence wrapped in a `<p>` tag should contain these HTML tags for emphasis.\n\nEven though the use of `<strong>` and `<em>` tags is correct, the failure to provide at least three `<p>` tags results in non-compliance with the chatbot description.\n\nERR"
