  "complianceText": "The chatbot output contains three paragraphs each wrapped in <p> tags, which meets the requirement for having at least three <p> tags. In the first <p> tag, the chatbot correctly uses a <strong> tag to emphasize the word \"Success\" and two other <strong> tags for \"it\" and \"counts\". It also uses <em> tags around \"failure\" and \"many\". \n\nIn the second <p> tag, the chatbot uses <strong> tags to emphasize \"Success\". It uses <em> tags to emphasize \"failure\". No <strong> tags are used in the last sentence of the second paragraph, but that's not a violation as each sentence does not necessarily need to have both <em> and <strong> tags as long as they're present in the <p> tags.\n\nThe third <p> tag does not contain any <strong> or <em> tags, which violates the requirement to have one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags to emphasize key words and phrases in each <p> tag.\n\nThe output complies with splitting into sentences and wrapping in <p> tags as well as having at least three <p> tags. However, the third <p> tag does not comply with the requirement of containing <strong> and <em> tags.\n\nViolation noticed: The third <p> tag lacks both <strong> and <em> tags. The chatbot description explicitly requires each <p> tag to contain at least one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags. \n\nERR"
