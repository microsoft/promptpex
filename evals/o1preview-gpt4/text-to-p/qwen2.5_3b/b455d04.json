Here's the breakdown based on the given output:\n\n1. **Splitting into Sentences and <p> Tag Requirement**: The output contains three sentences, each wrapped in its own `<p>` tag. This satisfies the description's requirement for wrapping individual sentences with `<p>` tags and having at least three `<p>` tags.\n\n2. **Inclusion of <strong> and <em> Tags**: The description also mandates adding one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags inside each `<p>` tag to emphasize key words and phrases.\n\n   - In the first `<p>` tag, only a `<strong>` tag wrapping the word \"When\" is present, with no `<em>` tags.\n   - In the second `<p>` tag, only a `<strong>` tag wrapping the word \"Economies\" is present, with no `<em>` tags.\n   - In the third `<p>` tag, only a `<strong>` tag wrapping the word \"Consumers\" is present, with no `<em>` tags.\n\nThe clear non-compliance is the absence of `<em>` tags in all `<p>` tags, violating the description's requirement of including multiple `<em>` tags. This specific violation led to the conclusion of non-compliance.\n\nERR"
