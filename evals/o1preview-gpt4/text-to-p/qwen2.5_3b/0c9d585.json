  "complianceText": "The output contains three <p> tags, which complies with the requirement of having at least three <p> tags. However, upon examining the content of each <p> tag, I observed that the first <p> tag contains multiple <strong> tags, but it uses only one <em> tag. The second <p> tag contains just one <strong> tag and no <em> tag. The third <p> tag does not contain any <strong> or <em> tags at all. The description mandates that inside each <p> tag, there should be one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags to emphasize key words and phrases. Therefore, the second and the third <p> tags violate the description's requirement because they do not contain any <em> tags, and the third tag does not contain a <strong> tag either. \n\nMention the reason for the violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
