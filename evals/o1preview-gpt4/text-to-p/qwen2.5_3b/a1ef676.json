However, there are more than three `<p>` tags present in the output, which do not violate the description. The problem arises with the specific requirement that each `<p>` tag must contain a `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags. \n\nWhile each `<p>` tag contains a `<strong>` tag, there are no `<em>` tags present in any of the `<p>` tags. Given this explicit lack of `<em>` tags, the output does not comply with the description provided.\n\nTherefore, the output violates the guideline that each `<p>` tag should contain multiple `<em>` tags in addition to a `<strong>` tag.\n\nERR"
