I've corrected that term. The paragraph is now properly formatted with appropriate emphasis using the <strong> and <em> tags within each <p> tag.",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot output includes three `<p>` tags, which is compliant with the requirement of having at least three paragraphs. Within each `<p>` tag, the chatbot has included at least one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags, which satisfies the requirement to use these tags for emphasizing key words and phrases.\n\nThe description mentions splitting the paragraph into individual sentences, but without the input, we cannot determine if the sentences are correctly split, so this aspect of the evaluation will be ignored.\n\nThe note regarding correcting the term from 'Main Street' to 'Main Road' is irrelevant to the compliance check, as it deals with content accuracy rather than formatting compliance.\n\nThere is no evident violation of the compliance criteria that do not require knowing the input.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
