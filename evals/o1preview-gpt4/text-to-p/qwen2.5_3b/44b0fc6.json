  "complianceText": "The output provided contains three `<p>` tags, which meets the requirement of having at least three `<p>` tags as per the description. However, within the `<p>` tags, the output is incorrect for the following reasons:\n\n1. The requirement is to use one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize keywords and phrases within each `<p>` tag. The output does use a `<strong>` tag, but it includes unfamiliar tags like `<highlight>` and `<mark>`, which are not mentioned in the description.\n\n2. The output includes `<em>` tags, but its use seems unstructured and incomplete according to expected use as a tag to emphasize certain words or phrases. The text, `<em>. </em>`, appears to be improperly formatted for emphasis.\n\n3. There is no adherence to solely using `<p>`, `<strong>`, and `<em>` tags as required. The presence of other tags violates the description guidelines.\n\nBecause of the incorrect tags (`<highlight>` and `<mark>`) and improper use of `<em>`, the output does not comply with the given description.\n\nERR"
