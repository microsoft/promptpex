The output satisfies this requirement, as it contains exactly three `<p>` tags.\n2. Inside each `<p>` tag, one `<strong>` tag must be present. The output satisfies this requirement, as each `<p>` tag contains at least one `<strong>` tag.\n3. Inside each `<p>` tag, there should be multiple `<em>` tags for emphasizing key words and phrases. The output contains multiple `<em>` tags in each `<p>`, thus fulfilling this requirement.\n\nAll key compliance criteria are met according to the description provided. There are no specific rules about the nesting of `<strong>` and `<em>` tags, so the nesting in the output does not violate any guidelines described.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
