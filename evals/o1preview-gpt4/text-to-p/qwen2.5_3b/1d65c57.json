Each `<p>` tag contains multiple `<em>` and `<strong>` tags, which align with the requirement to emphasize key words and phrases.\n3. There are three `<p>` tags in the output, meeting the requirement of having at least three `<p>` tags.\n\nThe output complies with the description provided because it satisfies all the structural requirements mentioned: splitting into sentences wrapped in `<p>` tags and including `<strong>` and `<em>` tags. As there is no information available about the input text, any potential issues with sentence splits cannot be assessed and are therefore beyond the scope of this evaluation.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
