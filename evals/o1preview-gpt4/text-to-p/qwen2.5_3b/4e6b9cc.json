  "complianceText": "The chatbot output includes four `<p>` tags, which satisfies the requirement of having at least three `<p>` tags. Each `<p>` tag contains at least one `<strong>` tag to emphasize a key word or phrase as specified in the description.\n\nAdditionally, the output includes multiple `<em>` tags within one of the `<p>` tags, which is consistent with the requirement to use multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize key words and phrases. The second `<p>` tag contains several `<em>` tags around emphasized words: \"The\", \"starts\", \"on\", \"Monday\", \"ends\", and \"Friday\".\n\nBased on the constraints given, the output appears to comply with the requirements described: splitting paragraphs into sentences, wrapping each sentence in `<p>` tags, requiring at least three `<p>` tags, and using `<strong>` and `<em>` tags correctly.\n\nNo violations are found with the given information.\n\nOK"
