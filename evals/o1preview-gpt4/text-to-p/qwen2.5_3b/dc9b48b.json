  "complianceText": "The chatbot output consists of three <p> tags, each containing the same paragraph of text. According to the description, the paragraph should be split into individual sentences, and each sentence should be wrapped in a <p> tag. However, in this output, each <p> tag contains the entire paragraph instead of individual sentences. Furthermore, since the paragraph is repeated three times in its entirety, it doesn't demonstrate the sentence-level division intended by the description. More critically, the description requires each sentence to be wrapped with a <p> tag and must demonstrate at least three <p> tags, meaning three distinct sentences should have been evident within the output. As the same paragraph is merely repeated without division into individual sentences within <p> tags, this is a violation of the requirements. Additionally, the presence of <strong> and <em> tags within each <p> tag satisfies that particular part of the criteria, but since the fundamental requirement of splitting into individual sentences is not met, it leads to non-compliance.\n\nERR"
