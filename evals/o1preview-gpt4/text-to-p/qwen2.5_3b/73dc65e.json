  "complianceText": "The evaluation of the chatbot output is as follows:\n\n1. The chatbot description specifies that the paragraph should be split into individual sentences, with each sentence wrapped with a `<p>` tag. In this output, there is only one `<p>` tag provided, which violates the requirement that each sentence be wrapped with a `<p>` tag.\n\n2. The description also states that there should be at least three `<p>` tags in the answer. Since there is only one `<p>` tag, this requirement is not met.\n\n3. Inside the `<p>` tags, there should be one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize key words and phrases. While the output does include these tags, the primary violation is the insufficient number of `<p>` tags.\n\nDue to the violation of having each sentence enclosed in a separate `<p>` tag and having at least three `<p>` tags, the chatbot's output does not comply with the provided description.\n\nERR"
