```","The input provided is evaluated based on the input specification which states that the input should be a paragraph of text containing at least three sentences. In assessing this input, we must determine if it qualifies as a paragraph and contains the requisite number of sentences.

1. **Paragraph Evaluation**: A paragraph typically consists of a collection of sentences that represent a complete idea or topic. The given input comprises three sentences: ""Cities expand rapidly."", ""Infrastructure develops."", and ""Communities grow together."". While these sentences are thematically linked, they are presented in a simple, linear sequence. Although concise, this collection of sentences can reasonably be interpreted as a paragraph addressing urban development and its effects.

2. **Sentence Count Compliance**: The specification clearly requires at least three sentences in the input. The input provided consists of three distinct and grammatically complete sentences, each separately punctuated with a period.

Based on this analysis, the input meets both criteria specified:

- It forms a paragraph, albeit a very brief one.
- It contains the minimum required number of sentences (three), as stipulated by the input specification.

Therefore, there are no violations of the input specification.
