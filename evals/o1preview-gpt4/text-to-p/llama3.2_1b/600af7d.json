  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not fully comply with the chatbot description. Upon reviewing the output, the following issues were identified:\n\n1. The description specifies that each sentence should be wrapped with a <p> tag. However, in the output, the <strong> tags are not inside any <p> tags, which is a violation. Each <strong> tag should be contained within its respective <p> tag.\n\n2. The output contains two occurrences of \"<strong> tags\", but they are not directly integrated within their respective sentences wrapped by <p> tags. Instead, one <strong> tag precedes a <p> tag and is improperly not closed, showing a clear formatting error.\n\n3. At least three <p> tags are included, which follows the guideline for having three sentences, but the inclusion of a <strong> tag outside a <p> tag disrupts the expected paragraph formatting.\n\nDue to these formatting issues, and the error in ensuring that <strong> tags and <em> tags are within <p> tags as described, the output does not comply with the description.\n\nERR"
