  "complianceText": "The output does not comply with the description. Here is why:\n\n1. The description specifies that the chatbot should split the paragraph into individual sentences and wrap each sentence with a `<p>` tag. The output does not properly follow this structure. The first sentence is within a `<p>` tag, but the second sentence starts with a `<span>` tag rather than a `<p>` tag, thus breaking the requirement.\n\n2. The output should contain at least three `<p>` tags. However, there are only two `<p>` tags present in the output, which violates the requirement of having at least three.\n\n3. The description specifies that inside each `<p>` tag, there should be one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize key words and phrases. In the given output, the use of `<strong>` and `<em>` tags does not adhere to this structure consistently within each `<p>` tag.\n\nBased on these observations, the output does not comply with the described requirements.\n\nERR"
