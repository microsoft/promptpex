  "compliance": "err",
  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output does not comply with the description for the following reasons:\n\n1. Incorrect HTML Element Usage: The description specifies that each sentence should be wrapped with a `<p>` tag, and within each `<p>` tag, the elements `<strong>` and `<em>` should be used. However, the output uses a `<span>` tag with a `strong` attribute, which is not correct. The correct usage should be the `<strong>` tag directly, not `<span strong>`.\n\n2. Lack of `<em>` Tags: The output uses a `<span em>` rather than the specified `<em>` tag directly. Moreover, there are multiple sentences in which the `<em>` tag is not present, failing to emphasize any keywords or phrases besides the given incorrect usage.\n\n3. Consistency in Structure: Each sentence in the paragraph should individually be wrapped in a `<p>` tag according to the description. The output doesn't clearly show individual sentences being wrapped in their own `<p>` tags due to lack of visible sentence separation within paragraphs.\n\nBased on the reasons above, the chatbot output does not align with the requirements as per the description provided.\n\nERR"
