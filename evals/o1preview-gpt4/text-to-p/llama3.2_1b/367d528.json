  "complianceText": "The output provided by the chatbot contains HTML paragraphs; however, there are several issues to note:\n\n1. Each sentence is not correctly wrapped with a `<p>` tag. While there are three `<p>` tags present, none of them contains a properly formatted HTML structure for the tags within (e.g., `<strong>Albert Einstein</strong>/em>` is malformed).\n\n2. The `<strong>` and `<em>` tags are used within the paragraphs but not correctly. The `<strong>` tags are not properly closed, and the `/em>` at the end seems like an erroneous input instead of a closing tag `</strong>`. This suggests a syntax error with HTML tag usage, as the correct structure either to close the `<strong>` or use `<em>` is not followed.\n\n3. There's unnecessary `<font>` tag usage with `color=\"black\"` around each paragraph, which was not specified in the chatbot description.\n\nOverall these issues indicate non-compliance with the specified instruction to add at least three `<p>` tags and use of `<strong>` and `<em>` tags correctly.\n\nERR"
