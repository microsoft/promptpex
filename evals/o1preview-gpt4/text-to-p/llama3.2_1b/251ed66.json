  "complianceText": "The chatbot output contains elements that need to be evaluated against the description. The description specifies that each sentence should be wrapped in a `<p>` tag. Additionally, there should be at least three `<p>` tags. Within each `<p>` tag, there should be at least one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags. However, the provided output displays several issues against these criteria:\n\n1. **Lack of Proper Sentence Wrapping**: The output does not consistently wrap each sentence with a `<p>` tag. The text provided appears to have multiple sentences, yet they are not distinctly wrapped.\n\n2. **<strong> and <em> usage**: The `<strong>` tags are utilized, but they are not appropriately closed or placed. The `<em>` tags are not present; however, the use of asterisks such as **Mathematics** and **Pythagorean** is observed which does not conform to the required `<em>` tags. \n\n3. **Expectations of at least three <p> tags**: The output includes mentions of `<span><p>...`, suggesting an incorrect opening tag structure and does not conclusively meet the requirement for at least three separate `<p>` tags around different sentences.\n\nGiven these points, the chatbot output does not comply with the description provided. The primary issues are the misuse and incorrect structuring of tags, including `<p>`, `<strong>`, and missing `<em>`, contrary to the expectations set forth in the description.\n\nERR"
