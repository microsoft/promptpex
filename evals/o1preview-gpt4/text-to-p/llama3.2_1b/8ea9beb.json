  "complianceText": "The chatbot output includes sentences wrapped in `<p>` tags along with emphasis using `<strong>` and `<em>` tags, which aligns with the requirement to format each sentence in a paragraph with these HTML elements. However, there are several compliance issues that deviate from the given description:\n\n1. **Syntax Errors with HTML Tags**: The `<strong>` and `<em>` tags have incorrect spacing which leads to them not being valid HTML tags (e.g., `<strong>castles</ strong>`, `<em>nobility</ em>`). The same issue appears throughout the output for all such tags.\n   \n2. **Minimum `<p>` Tag Requirement**: The description requires that the answer should have at least three `<p>` tags. The output satisfies this requirement as there are multiple `<p>` tags in the output.\n\nThe presence of incorrect HTML tag syntax constitutes a violation as it goes against the requirement to properly wrap and emphasize keywords within the `<p>` tags. Ensuring correct HTML syntax is part of complying with the description expectations for formatting the paragraph.\n\nERR"
