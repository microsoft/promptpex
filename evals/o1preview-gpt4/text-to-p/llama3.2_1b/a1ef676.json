  "complianceText": "The chatbot output has three <p> tags, but there's a violation of the guideline to keep every sentence inside a <p> tag. There is also exactly one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags inside each <p> tag. The fourth sentence is not wrapped inside a <p> tag but added as part of the third one, which highlights a violation of the requirement to split the text into sentences and handle each one separately. Moreover, there is malformed HTML with incorrect closing tags in the <strong> and <em> tags (spaces before 'strong' and 'em' in closing tags).\n\nThe specific non-compliance I identified is as follows:\n1. The output does not respect the requirement to split each sentence into individual <p> tags, as the last sentence is not properly placed inside its own <p> tag.\n2. The output contains four sentences but only three <p> tags, so it should comply with \"your answer should have at least three <p> tags,\" but each sentence must be wrapped in a <p> tag; thus, the placement of the final sentence is incorrect.\n3. Malformed HTML tags are present due to spaces in closing tags.\n\nThinking through these issues and citing these reasons, there is a clear non-compliance.\n\nERR"
