  "complianceText": "The output provided by the chatbot does not fully comply with the description based on the following observations:\n\n1. **Incorrect Tag Usage**: The description specifies that each sentence should be wrapped in a `<p>` tag. In the output provided, the sentences do have `<p>` tags around them; however, there is an incorrect closing of the tags. Proper opening `<p>` and closing `</p>` tags must be used around each sentence.\n\n2. **Tag Closing Structure**: The description asks for each sentence to be in its own `<p>` tag. The sentences are improperly closed, as indicated by nested `<p>` tags, and there is an unnecessary closing `</p>` tag at the end, which does not appropriately close any single opened `<p>`.\n\n3. **Use of <em> Tags**: Instead of `<em>` tags, the output uses `<i>` tags for emphasizing key words, which does not comply with the requirement of using `<em>` tags as specified in the description.\n\nDue to these violations, the output does not fully adhere to the description.\n\nERR"
