  "output": "<p><strong>Water</strong>, the most widely used and accessible element on Earth, boils at 100°C (212°F) under normal conditions at sea level.[1] However, on Mount Everest, it boils at a lower temperature due to the decreased air pressure.</p>\n<p><strong>As</strong> climbers ascend higher mountains like Mount Everest, the <em>atmospheric</em> conditions become increasingly cold.</p>\n<p><strong>Similarly</strong>, the <em>decreased</em> temperature at high elevations affects cooking times for climbers, as they need to wait longer for hot water and food to boil successfully.</p>\n<p><strong>This</strong> highlights the importance of understanding the environmental factors that can impact human performance under extreme conditions.</p>\n<p><strong>Naturally</strong>, these challenges are not unique to Mount Everest; variations in atmospheric pressure also occur at other high-altitude locations, affecting activities such as mountaineering and emergency response.</p>\n<p><strong>Furthermore</strong>, the <em>safety</em> of climbers relies on their ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions, making knowledge about human physiology and atmospheric science crucial for survival in extreme environments.</p>\n```",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output is intended to format a paragraph of text as HTML, wrapping each sentence with a <p> tag, and including at least one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags within each <p> tag.\n\nUpon evaluating the output, the following points were observed:\n1. The output contains six <p> tags, which meets the requirement of having at least three <p> tags. \n2. Each <p> tag contains exactly one <strong> tag, which satisfies the requirement for having at least one <strong> tag inside each <p> tag.\n3. Each <p> tag does not necessarily contain multiple <em> tags. For example, the second and sixth paragraphs have only one <em> tag. The description requires multiple <em> tags for each <p> tag, which means at least two, so this requirement is not fully satisfied for all <p> tags.\n\nThe output does not comply with the requirement to have multiple <em> tags in each <p> tag. Because of this non-compliance with the description, the final decision is 'ERR'. \n\nERR"
