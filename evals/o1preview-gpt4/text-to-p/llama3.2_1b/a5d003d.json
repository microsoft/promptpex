  "complianceText": "The chatbot output has several issues in complying with the description:\n\n- The first `<p>` tag does not contain a `<strong>` tag or any `<em>` tags, which violates the requirement to include these tags in each `<p>` element.\n- The second `<p>` tag correctly includes a `<strong>` tag but lacks multiple `<em>` tags as specified. Instead, \"how\" is only bolded and not in italics.\n- The third `<p>` tag includes none of the required tags properly as per HTML markup. The word \"is\" appears to be incorrectly formatted with asterisks `*` instead of being wrapped with `<em>` tags.\n\nUltimately, the output does not include each sentence with at least one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags as required. Therefore, it does not fully comply with the description.\n\nERR"
