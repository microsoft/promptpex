  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not comply with the description provided for several reasons:\n\n1. **Missing `<strong>` Tags**: The description requires each `<p>` tag to contain at least one `<strong>` tag. In the given output, there are no `<strong>` tags present in any of the `<p>` tags.\n\n2. **Misuse of `<div>` Tag**: The description specifies formatting a paragraph of text using `<p>` tags only, along with `<strong>` and `<em>` tags within those `<p>` tags. However, in the last `<p>` tag, the output contains a `<div>` tag, which is not allowed or mentioned in the description.\n\n3. **Structure Requirements**: The description requires sentences to be wrapped in `<p>` tags with specific additional HTML tags. Despite having multiple `<p>` tags and complying with the rule of having at least three `<p>` tags, the output does not meet the requirement for including both `<strong>` and `<em>` tags inside each `<p>` tag.\n\nThe output violates multiple compliance criteria as specified in the description.\n\nERR"
