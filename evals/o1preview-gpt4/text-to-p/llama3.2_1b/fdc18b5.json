The third sentence is incorrectly formatted with a comma instead of a greater-than symbol in the opening `<p>` tag: `<p,Writers tell <em>stories</em>.</p>` should be `<p>Writers tell <em>stories</em>.</p>`.\n \n2. The description specifies that each `<p>` tag should contain one `<strong>` tag. However, in the second and third sentences, there is no `<strong>` tag at all â€” only `<em>` tags have been used. Only the first sentence contains a `<strong>` tag as required.\n\nBased on these points, the output violates part of the description regarding the structure and format of HTML tags within each paragraph.\n\nERR"
