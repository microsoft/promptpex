  "complianceText": "Upon reviewing the chatbot output, I notice several points:\n\n1. **Number of <p> Tags**: The output contains exactly three `<p>` tags as required, which aligns with the description guideline.\n   \n2. **<strong> and <em> Tags within <p> Tags**: The description requires each sentence wrapped in a `<p>` tag to include at least one `<strong>` tag, and multiple `<em>` tags. However, in the provided output, the `<strong>` tags appear outside of the `<p>` tags, which does not comply with the guideline of having them inside the `<p>` tags. Additionally, there are no `<em>` tags present in the output, which again violates the requirement.\n\n3. **Use of Placeholder Text**: There is a mention of placeholder text for the refund treatment section. From the description, there isn't any stipulation about using or not using placeholder text, so its presence does not create a compliance issue.\n\nOverall, the primary violations are the absence of `<em>` tags for emphasizing key words and phrases as stated and the incorrect placement of `<strong>` tags outside the `<p>` tags, rather than inside as required. Therefore, considering these issues:\n\nERR"
