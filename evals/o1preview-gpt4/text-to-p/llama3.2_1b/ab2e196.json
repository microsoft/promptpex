  "complianceText": "The output is being evaluated with the given chatbot description:\n\n1. **Paragraph Splitting and <p> Tags**: The output should have sentences split and wrapped individually by <p> tags. The rule requiring at least three <p> tags is met.\n\n2. **<strong> and <em> Tags**: The description specifies wrapping key words and phrases in a <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags inside each <p> tag. Here, there is an issue. Not every <p> tag contains <strong> or <em> tags. Instead, <strong> tags are used for whole words, and not phrases, and seem infrequent.\n\n3. **HTML Structure & Sentence Integrity**: The sentences are broken unexpectedly, which suggests the original intention was not to complete sentences with a single <p> tag each. Instead, several words are individually wrapped in their own <p> tags.\n\nThe output does not comply with several aspects of the description. Multiple <p> tags are not being used properly for complete sentences and the usage of <strong> and <em> tags does not align with key phrases as indicated in the description.\n\nERR"
