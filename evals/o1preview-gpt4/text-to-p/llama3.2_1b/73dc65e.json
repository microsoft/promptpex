  "compliance": "err",
  "complianceText": "The output does not comply with the description, as follows:\n\n1. **<p> Tag Usage**: The description specifies that each sentence should be wrapped in a <p> tag. However, there are lines wrapped in <i> tags and multiple <p> tags begin with \"**\", which suggests formatting errors.\n2. **Number of <p> Tags Violations**: The description states that the output should have at least three <p> tags. While there are indeed more than three <p> tags present, some sentences are not wrapped in <p> tags but use <i> tags instead.\n3. **Use of <strong> and <em> Tags**: While <strong> and <em> tags are used within <p> tags, the description does not mention using <i> tags. Thus, the usage of <i> tags, which are not mentioned in the description as a valid format, further violates the compliance requirements.\n4. **Formatting Errors**: There are apparent formatting errors, with \"**\" preceding some <p> tags, indicating a non-standard formatting that is not compliant.\n\nGiven these points, the output does not wholly comply with the description.\n\nERR"
