  "complianceText": "The chatbot has included HTML tags in its output. However, specific guidelines from the description are not fully met. The description requires that each sentence be wrapped in a `<p>` tag, and each `<p>` tag should have at least one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize key words and phrases. \n\n- Upon reviewing the provided output:\n  - Although there are more than three `<p>` tags, not each sentence is wrapped in its own `<p>` tag. Some sentences are combined in a single `<p>`.\n  - Not every `<p>` tag contains a `<strong>` tag, which is a requirement.\n  - While there are multiple `<em>` tags present in the output, they are not consistently included in each `<p>` tag alongside a `<strong>` tag.\n\nConsidering the requirements, the output is not compliant because it does not follow the specific requirement of having each sentence wrapped in its own `<p>` tag, and it doesn't ensure both `<strong>` and `<em>` tags in every `<p>` tag.\n\nERR"
