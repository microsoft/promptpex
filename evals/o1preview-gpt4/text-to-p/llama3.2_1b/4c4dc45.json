  "complianceText": "The chatbot output violates the guidelines provided in the description. Specifically:\n\n1. **Presence of Non-compliant Elements**: The description instructs that each sentence within the paragraph should be wrapped individually in a `<p>` tag. However, the output provided includes an HTML `<table>` element with a `<tr>` and `<td>`, which is not requested or compliant with the description. The table is entirely unnecessary and adds complexity not warranted by the task description.\n\n2. **Extraneous Information**: The note at the bottom mentions that the table is not provided as it was not requested. This demonstrates that the table's inclusion itself is contrary to the instructions, which require only paragraph formatting. \n\n3. **Minimum Number of `<p>` Tags**: While there should be at least three `<p>` tags, the output actually contains more than three paragraphs which is compliant with the requirement.\n\nFor these reasons, primarily the inclusion of a table which deviates from the specified format, the output is considered non-compliant.\n\nERR"
