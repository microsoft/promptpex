  "compliance": "err",
  "complianceText": "The output fails to comply with the chatbot description on several counts:\n\n1. **Incorrect Paragraph Splitting and Tagging**: The description requires each sentence to be wrapped with a `<p>` tag, and there should be at least three `<p>` tags. However, the output contains HTML elements like `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<strong>`, and `<em>` outside the expected usage in paragraphs. There are mixed non-HTML compliant tags as well, like `<b>` inside `<p>`.\n\n2. **Lack of Proper Structure and Nesting**: The structure of the HTML does not follow proper syntax (e.g., `<b>` is incorrectly closed as `<b<`). Tags like `<em>` and `<strong>` are not used correctly or consistently within `<p>` tags; they are used arbitrarily within and outside as `<em>` and `<strong>` (such as the invalid usage in `<h1>` and `<h2>`).\n\n3. **Inconsistent and Incorrect Formatting**: The sentence structure appears unorganized with HTML entities and nested tags not correctly closed or opened (e.g., `<strong>Action Words:</strong>` is improperly enclosed within backticks).\n\nDue to these points, the output does not comply with the chatbot description requirements. The key formatting steps, such as accurate use of `<p>`, `<strong>`, and `<em>` tags, have not been followed effectively.\n\nERR"
