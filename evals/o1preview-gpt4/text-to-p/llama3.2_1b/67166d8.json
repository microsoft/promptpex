  "complianceText": "Based on the chatbot's output, there are several compliance issues with the description provided:\n\n1. **Tag usage**: According to the description, each sentence should be enclosed in `<p>` tags, and inside each `<p>` tag, there should be one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize key words and phrases. The output fails to comply with this guideline:\n   - There are `<span>` tags used instead of embedding `<strong>` and `<em>` tags directly inside `<p>` tags.\n   - The `<strong>` tag is not present in the first `<p>` tag, and the `<span>` tags are incorrectly used.\n   \n2. **Presence of `<strong>` and `<em>` tags**: The description specifies that each `<p>` should contain one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags, which is partially non-compliant in the output. Only one `<span strong>` and one `<span em>` usage are provided, and they're not correctly formatted.\n\nThe incorrect use of tags and the absence of required formatting inside the `<p>` tags violate the chatbot's description.\n\nERR"
