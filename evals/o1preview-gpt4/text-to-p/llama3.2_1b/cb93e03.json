  "complianceText": "The evaluation of the chatbot output involves checking if it complies with the rules given in the description.\n\n1. Number of <p> tags:\n   - The output contains four <p> tags which satisfies the requirement \"Your answer should have at least three <p> tags.\"\n\n2. Proper closure of <p> tags:\n   - The third <p> tag is not properly closed. It ends with an <em> tag instead of </p>, which violates HTML structure rules. The proper syntax for closing should be checked as per the requirement.\n\n3. Usage of <strong> tag:\n   - The <strong> tag is used only once but is incorrectly used; it isn't within any <p> tags. It exists outside of the <p> tag, which violates the description stating that \"Then, inside each <p> tag, add one <strong> tag.\"\n\n4. Usage of <em> tags:\n   - The description states that there should be multiple <em> tags inside each <p> tag. However, the tags appear incomplete and not all tags include an <em> tag effectively within each <p> tag as expected.\n\nBased on these points, the output does not comply with the description provided. Multiple violations exist such as improper HTML structure with <p> and <strong> tags usage, leading to non-compliance.\n\nERR"
