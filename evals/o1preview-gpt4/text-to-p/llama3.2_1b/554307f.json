  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output does not comply with the description. Here is the reasoning:\n\n1. **Wrapping Sentences with <p> tags**: Although several sentences are wrapped with <p> tags, there is an arbitrary use of other HTML tags such as <div> tags outside of the <p> tags. The description specifies that the sentences should only be wrapped with <p> tags and not other tags.\n\n2. **Use of <strong> and <em> tags**: The use of <strong> tags is very limited. Only a couple of <strong> tags appear in the output. There are no <em> tags used even though the task requires multiple <em> tags inside each <p> tag to emphasize key words and phrases.\n\n3. **Minimum Three <p> Tags**: The output has more than three <p> tags, so this part of the requirement is satisfied.\n\nDue to the incorrect structuring and lack of proper use of <strong> and <em> tags, the output fails to comply with the description.\n\nERR"
