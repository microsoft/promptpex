  "complianceText": "The output provided by the chatbot does not comply with the description. Here are the specific elements leading to this conclusion:\n\n1. **Incorrect Tag Structure**: The output contains improperly closed or mismatched tags. For example, the first <p> tag is written as \"<_p>\", which is incorrect, and there's an unmatching closing </p> tag without an opening <p> tag later in the text.\n\n2. **Strong and em Tags Requirements**: While there are <strong> tags mentioned in the text, they wrap complete sentences, which is inconsistent with the requirement to use them to emphasize key words and phrases within the <p> tags. Similarly, the use of <em> tags is very minimal, and not applied to multiple phrases within each sentence, which does not fully comply with adding multiple <em> tags.\n\n3. **Minimum Three <p> Tags Repeated**: The sentences seem to be repeated within the <strong> tags and <p> tags. Moreover, there is a repetition of the sequence \"<strong-Oxygen is essential for human life-</strong><p>We breathe it in with every breath.</p>\", which is improper structure as per HTML syntax.\n\nTaking into account these points of non-compliance, the chatbot's output does not meet the format and structural requirements outlined in its description.\n\nERR"
