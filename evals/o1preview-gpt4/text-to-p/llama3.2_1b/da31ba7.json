However, the only rule that can be evaluated without the input is that the output should have at least three <p> tags.\n\nUpon inspection, the text contains more than three <p> tags; however, the formatting seems to be incorrect. Several of the <p> tags seem to be misformatted (e.g., extra spaces or missing closing tags). Additionally, the <em> tags are not properly closed or opened properly, leading to readability issues.\n\nThe specific violations include:\n- Misformatted <p> tags with extra spaces due to spaces between the opening angle bracket and 'p' (e.g., < p> instead of <p>).\n- Improper nesting and closure of <em> tags which are improperly formatted in phrases, e.g., several missing closing or opening tags and misplaced symbols like periods.\n\nSince these formatting issues are related to the adherence to proper HTML structure and are not simply stylistic choices, they must be considered violations of the description's requirements.\n\nERR"
