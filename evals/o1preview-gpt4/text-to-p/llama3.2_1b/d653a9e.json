  "complianceText": "The chatbot output contains three HTML constructs, but it introduces a non-standard HTML tag `<pons>` that is not specified in the description. The correct tag to be used in the output should be `<p>` as per the description. Herein lies the primary violation: the usage of incorrect HTML tags instead of the given `<p>` tags to encapsulate each sentence. While it is possible there are sentences encapsulated within `<p>` tags, the presence of `<pons>` makes it ambiguous and incorrect based on the provided description.\n\nThe consistency of using exactly the specified tags is crucial to ensure compliance. Since the output does not properly follow the requirement of exclusively using `<p>` tags to wrap sentences, it violates this specific rule. According to the chatbot description, we should see at least three `<p>` tags.\n\nDue to the violations caused by the misuse of tags, I conclude the following:\n\nThe presence of `<pons>` suggests a violation of the requirement to wrap sentences strictly within `<p>` tags, leading to non-compliance. \n\nERR"
