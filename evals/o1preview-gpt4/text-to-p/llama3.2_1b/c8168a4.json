  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not fully comply with the description. According to the description, the output should have each sentence wrapped in a separate <p> tag, which is not the case here. Instead, multiple sentences are included within a single <p> tag. Additionally, the description specifies that there should be at least three <p> tags. While there are multiple <p> tags present, the requirement for wrapping each sentence individually with a <p> tag has not been followed. Further, it seems the use of single <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags is not correctly applied to each sentence within its own <p> tag, as requested.\n\nThe output groups multiple sentences in single <p> tags, showing non-compliance with the explicit requirement to split sentences individually into <p> tags. This clearly violates the instruction and leads to a decision of non-compliance.\n\nERR"
