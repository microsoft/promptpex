  "complianceText": "The given HTML output is evaluated against the description provided. According to the rules:\n\n1. The paragraph must be split into individual sentences, with each wrapped in a `<p>` tag.\n2. The output should include at least three `<p>` tags.\n3. Inside each `<p>` tag, there must be one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize key words and phrases.\n\nChecking the provided output:\n\n- The output contains three `<p>` tags each representing a single sentence. This complies with the rule requiring at least three `<p>` tags.\n- In the first `<p>` tag, there is one `<strong>` tag (\"Albert Einstein\") and multiple `<em>` tags (\"theory\" and \"relativity\").\n- In the second `<p>` tag, there is one `<strong>` tag (\"revolutionized\") and multiple `<em>` tags (\"physics\").\n- In the third `<p>` tag, there is one `<strong>` tag (\"greatest\") and one `<em>` tag (\"scientists\").\n\nThe output thus adheres to all the specified requirements. The use of `<strong>` and `<em>` tags in each `<p>` tag is in compliance with the description. Therefore, the output format is correct and meets the description without any violation noted.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
