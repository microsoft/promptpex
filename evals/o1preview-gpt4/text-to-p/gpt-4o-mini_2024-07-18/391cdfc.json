  "complianceText": "The chatbot output contains six <p> tags, which exceeds the minimum requirement of at least three <p> tags, thus complying with that portion of the description. However, the description requires that each <p> tag must have one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags. In this output, each <p> tag contains only one <em> tag. The use of multiple <em> tags is not followed, which constitutes a non-compliance.\n\nThe violation of the guideline stems from the failure to include multiple <em> tags per <p> tag. Each <p> tag includes one <strong> tag which is correct, but there should be more than one <em> tag in every <p> tag to meet the criteria stated. Therefore, there is a clear deviation from the described output format.\n\nERR"
