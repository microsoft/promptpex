Each of these tags contains one `<strong>` tag, which complies with the description of adding one `<strong>` tag per sentence. Multiple `<em>` tags are used within each sentence to emphasize certain words, which is again in compliance with the provided guidelines. The presence of duplicate sentences does not violate any rules in the description, as the constraints do not specify unique sentences. Therefore, the output follows all the requirements explicitly stated in the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
