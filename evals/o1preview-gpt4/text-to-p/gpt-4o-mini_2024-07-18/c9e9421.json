This is consistent with the description.\n\nSince the output contains the minimum required number of <p> tags, appropriately utilizes <strong> tags, and includes multiple <em> tags, it adheres directly to the chatbot's description without requiring any assumptions or inputs. Thus, it complies with the requirements.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
