  "complianceText": "The chatbot description instructs to format a paragraph of text by splitting it into individual sentences and wrapping each sentence with a `<p>` tag. It requires there to be at least three `<p>` tags in the output, which the current output complies with as it has six `<p>` tags. However, the description also specifies that inside each `<p>` tag, one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags should be added to emphasize key words and phrases. The output provided contains only one `<em>` tag per `<p>` tag, not multiple.\n\nTherefore, the specific violation here is that the chatbot output does not comply with the requirement of multiple `<em>` tags inside each `<p>` tag. Each of the `<p>` tags only contains one `<em>` tag, which does not fulfill the description's requirement for multiple `<em>` tags per `<p>`.\n\nERR"
