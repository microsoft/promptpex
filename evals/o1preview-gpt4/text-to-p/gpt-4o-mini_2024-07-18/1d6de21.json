  "complianceText": "The provided output consists of three `<p>` tags, each containing at least one `<strong>` tag to emphasize a phrase, and multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize key words. This aligns with the description requirements effectively. Specifically:\n\n1. The first `<p>` tag has the sentence \"The Great Wall of China is visible from space.\" It wraps \"The Great Wall of China\" with `<strong>` tags and emphasizes \"visible\" and \"space\" using `<em>` tags.\n2. The second `<p>` tag contains \"It was built to protect against invasions.\" It wraps \"built\" with `<strong>` tags and emphasizes \"invasions\" with `<em>` tags.\n3. The third `<p>` tag contains the sentence \"It stretches over 13,000 miles.\" It wraps \"13,000 miles\" with `<strong>` tags.\n\nThe output satisfies the requirement of having at least three `<p>` tags and uses the `<strong>` and `<em>` tags appropriately.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
