  "complianceText": "The chatbot output consists of six `<p>` tags. The description requires that the answer should have at least three `<p>` tags, and this condition is met since there are more than three `<p>` tags present in the output. Additionally, each `<p>` tag contains one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags, which complies with the requirement to emphasize key words and phrases within each `<p>` tag using these tags.\n\nBased on this evaluation, all explicit requirements outlined in the description (that do not require knowledge of the input) are met. Consequently, the chatbot output adheres to the format and structural requirements provided in the description. \n\nNo further violations are identified, and the output is thus compliant with the description given.\n\nOK"
