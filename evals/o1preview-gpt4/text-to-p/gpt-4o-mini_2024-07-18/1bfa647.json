There are at least three `<p>` tags present in the output, which satisfies the requirement for multiple `<p>` tags.\n2. Each `<p>` tag contains a `<strong>` tag, which emphasizes a key word or phrase.\n3. Each `<p>` tag also contains multiple `<em>` tags, which are used to emphasize key words and phrases.\n4. There is no sentence splitting check that requires input knowledge, so compliance is evaluated solely on the structure and use of HTML tags.\n\nBased on the description provided and without needing to know the input, the output meets all directly observable requirements. Therefore, there are no detected violations.\n\nOK"
