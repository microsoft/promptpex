This satisfies the requirement that there should be at least three `<p>` tags, as specified in the description.\n\n2. **Inclusion of `<strong>` and `<em>` Tags**: Within each `<p>` tag, the output includes one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags, which are used to emphasize key words and phrases. This behavior is in direct compliance with the instructions in the description.\n\nGiven that these parts of the description can be evaluated without knowledge of the input and all observed elements are directly compliant with them, the output adheres entirely to the chatbot description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
