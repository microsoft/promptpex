Each sentence includes one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags, which also complies with the description that specifies adding one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags inside each `<p>` tag to emphasize key words and phrases.\n\nThe description does not specify that the sentences must be unique, so the repetition of the same three sentences in the remaining three `<p>` tags does not violate the stated requirements.\n\nBased solely on these observations and without assuming any further input-related context, the output complies with the format description provided.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
