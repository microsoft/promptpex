However, the output provided contains six <p> tags. The duplicated sentences (\"Mathematics is universal.\", \"Equations describe reality.\", \"Numbers reveal patterns.\") indicate that the same three sentences have been repeated, resulting in a doubled structure which is inconsistent with the guideline indicating \"at least three <p> tags\" but not asking for duplications.\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
