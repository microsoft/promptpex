The output contains three separate `<p>` tags:\n   - `<p><strong>Mountains</strong> can affect <em>weather patterns</em>.</p>`\n   - `<p>They can <strong>block storms</strong> or cause <em>rain shadows</em>.</p>`\n   - `<p><strong>Climbers</strong> must be <em>prepared</em> for <strong>sudden changes</strong>.</p>`\n   \n   This satisfies the requirement that the output should have at least three `<p>` tags.\n\n2. Each `<p>` tag includes a `<strong>` tag, which aligns with the instruction to add one `<strong>` tag inside each `<p>` tag. \n\n3. The `<em>` tags are used to emphasize key words and phrases, with at least one `<em>` tag being present inside each `<p>` tag, complying with the requirement to use multiple `<em>` tags.\n\nBased on the above points, the output meets the compliance requirements as specified. No violations of the description are found as the structure and use of tags adhere to the description given.\n\nOK"
