Furthermore, the description mandates that there should be at least three `<p>` tags, and this output fulfills that requirement by providing double the number of required `<p>` tags. The repetition of content in the output does not affect the compliance with the description, as it fulfills the key requirements outlined.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
