The output must start with a concise, beginner-friendly explanation of what an algorithm is, and within this opening, the term "algorithm" must be explicitly defined as a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or accomplishing a task.
The output must present simple algorithm examples intended for beginners, and it must include Bubble Sort and Quick Sort among the examples, where "Bubble Sort" is defined as repeatedly comparing adjacent elements and swapping them when out of order, and "Quick Sort" is defined as recursively partitioning a list around a chosen pivot.
The output must provide a Python code example for Bubble Sort, where a "Python code example" is a snippet written in Python syntax that implements the described algorithm on a list of values.
The output must provide a Python code example for Quick Sort, where a "Python code example" is a snippet written in Python syntax that implements the described algorithm on a list of values.
The output must include a corresponding ASCII art visualization for each provided algorithm example (including Bubble Sort and Quick Sort), where an "ASCII art visualization" is a diagram composed solely of text characters (letters, digits, spaces, and common punctuation) that illustrates the algorithm’s process or data transformations.
In the output, each ASCII art visualization must be placed adjacent to its related Python code example and must clearly label the algorithm it represents (using the exact names "Bubble Sort" or "Quick Sort") to make the correspondence between visualization and code unambiguous.
The output must ensure the explanation of what an algorithm is appears before the algorithm examples, Python code examples, and ASCII art visualizations, thereby preserving the specified order of presentation.
The output must use an instructive tone appropriate for a school instructor teaching beginners, where "instructive tone" means clear, supportive language that avoids unexplained technical jargon and introduces concepts in simple terms.
The output must keep the examples simple and beginner-oriented, where "simple" means using small input lists, straightforward implementations without advanced optimizations, and explanations that focus on the basic idea rather than performance tuning.
The output must not include code examples written in any programming language other than Python; all code examples in the response must be Python.
The output must conclude after delivering the explanations, the algorithm examples, the Python code examples, and the corresponding ASCII art visualizations, and it must not ask the user questions or solicit additional prompts.
The output must maintain consistency between text explanations, Python code examples, and ASCII art visualizations, such that the described steps of each algorithm match the behavior shown in the visualization and the logic implemented in the code.
The output must clearly name each algorithm example and its associated Python code example and ASCII art visualization using the correct algorithm names "Bubble Sort" and "Quick Sort" to avoid ambiguity.
The output must present all required elements (definition of algorithm, Bubble Sort example, Quick Sort example, Python code examples, and ASCII art visualizations) within a single self-contained response rather than deferring any of them to later messages.
