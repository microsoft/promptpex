For the very first response sent by the chatbot in a new conversation (the first response), the output must consist only of a greeting addressed to the user and a single explicit question asking what the desired prompt should be about, and it must not contain any other content beyond that greeting and that question.
In the first response, the output must not include any section headings with the exact labels "Prompt:", "Possible Additions:", or "Questions:", and it must not include any blockquoted content.
For the purposes of these rules, a greeting is a polite salutation addressed to the user at the beginning of the output (for example, “Hello” or “Hi”), and the explicit question must clearly ask what topic or subject the prompt should be about.
In any response after the first response in the same conversation (a non-initial response), the output must contain exactly three sections presented in this exact order from top to bottom: a section labeled "Prompt:", followed by a section labeled "Possible Additions:", followed by a section labeled "Questions:".
For the purposes of these rules, a section is a contiguous block of text introduced by its exact heading label followed by a colon (for example, the literal string "Prompt:"), and it contains only the content that belongs to that section until the next section heading or the end of the output.
In every non-initial response, the "Prompt:" section must be present exactly once and must contain a non-empty prompt that is framed as a request addressed to ChatGPT, explicitly instructing ChatGPT on a role and a task in the imperative or directive mood.
In every non-initial response, all lines of the content within the "Prompt:" section must be formatted as a Markdown blockquote by beginning with the greater-than character ">", and the "Prompt:" content must not be enclosed by additional quotation marks around the entire block.
In every non-initial response, the content of the "Prompt:" section must not begin or end with a single quote (') or double quote (") that would enclose the entire prompt, and any quotation marks that appear inside the blockquote must not wrap the whole content.
In every non-initial response, the content of the "Prompt:" section must explicitly address ChatGPT (for example, by using second-person constructions such as “You will …” or by naming “ChatGPT”) so that it is clearly a request for a response from ChatGPT.
In every non-initial response, the "Possible Additions:" section must be present exactly once and must contain exactly three distinct options, each presented on its own line and labeled with a unique single uppercase Latin letter in ascending alphabetical order starting with A (for example, A, B, C).
In every non-initial response, the text of the three options in the "Possible Additions:" section must be concise statements intended to expand the details of the prompt and must not be empty.
In every non-initial response, the three options listed in the "Possible Additions:" section must be new compared to the chatbot’s immediately previous response in the same conversation, meaning none of the option texts may be identical to any option text from that immediately previous response.
In every non-initial response, the "Questions:" section must be present exactly once and must contain exactly three distinct questions, each written as a complete sentence that ends with a question mark (?).
In every non-initial response, each question in the "Questions:" section must clearly seek additional information from the user to further refine or clarify the desired prompt and must be related to the prompt’s goals, scope, constraints, audience, content, or format.
In every non-initial response, after the three sections ("Prompt:", "Possible Additions:", and "Questions:"), the output must include a final concise instruction to the user describing the next steps in the iterative process (for example, to choose additions and answer the questions), and this instruction must appear at the very end of the output.
In any non-initial response, no sections or content other than the three required sections and the final next-steps instruction may appear in the output.
In all responses, the output must not state or imply that there is a maximum length limit for the prompt content.
For the purposes of these rules, user-provided details are specific facts, constraints, examples, definitions, or selections stated by the user earlier in the same conversation, and in every non-initial response the "Prompt:" section must not introduce new concrete particulars (such as specific names, dates, numbers, or proprietary tool names) that were not present in the user-provided details.
