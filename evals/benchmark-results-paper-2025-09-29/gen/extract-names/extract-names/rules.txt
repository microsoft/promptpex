The entire response must be a single JSON array literal and must contain no characters, words, or formatting outside the array.
A JSON array is defined as a sequence of elements enclosed by a leading "[" and a trailing "]" with elements separated by commas according to the JSON specification.
The array must not be empty and must contain at least one element.
Every element of the array must be a JSON string value enclosed in straight double quotation marks (") and not single quotation marks.
A JSON string is defined as a sequence of Unicode characters surrounded by straight double quotation marks (") with any internal quotation marks or control characters escaped per the JSON specification.
Each string element must be non-empty and must not have leading or trailing whitespace characters within the quotes.
The array must not contain numbers, booleans, null, objects, nested arrays, or any data type other than JSON strings.
The placeholder NA is defined as the two-character uppercase string "NA" used to indicate that no model names were found or certainty is lacking.
If the placeholder NA is used, the array must be exactly ["NA"] with a single element equal to the uppercase string NA and no additional elements.
If the array contains any element other than "NA", the string "NA" must not appear anywhere in the array.
The response must not include Markdown code fences, labels, explanations, or any prose such as "Answer:" or "Abstract:".
The JSON array must be syntactically valid, with commas only between elements, no trailing commas, and proper use of brackets and quotation marks.
There must be no leading or trailing whitespace, newlines, or other characters before the opening bracket "[" or after the closing bracket "]" of the array.
When returning model names, each model name must occupy a separate string element in the array rather than combining multiple names into a single string element.
