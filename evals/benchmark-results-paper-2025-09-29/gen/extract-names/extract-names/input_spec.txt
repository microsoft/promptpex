The input is a single plain-text string representing the abstract of a machine learning paper.
The input may contain any natural-language text typical of abstracts, including multiple sentences, punctuation, numbers, acronyms, citations, special characters, hyphens, slashes, capitalization variants, version-like tokens, and named entities such as model names.
The input may omit model names, be ambiguous about model naming, or even be unrelated text, and it remains a valid input.
The input can be any length, including empty or whitespace-only.
