Meter: The prevailing meter is iambic pentameter: five iambic feet (unstressed–stressed) per line. Acceptable variations include initial trochaic inversion, spondaic emphasis, pyrrhic relief, and elision or contraction to preserve metrical count.\n\n3. Rhyme Scheme: The canonical scheme is ABAB CDCD EFEF GG. Rhyme is generally exact; eye rhyme is common owing to Early Modern orthography. Variant pronunciations may be employed to secure correspondence.\n\n4. Volta (Rhetorical Turn): A thematic or argumentative shift doth typically arise at line nine (entrance to the third quatrain) or at the final couplet, wherein summary, contradiction, or resolution is articulated.\n\n5. Syntax and Rhetoric: Expect balanced antithesis, extended conceit, apostrophe, and parallel structures. Caesurae and enjambment modulate pace; the couplet oft delivers epigrammatic closure.\n\n6. Typical Themes: Love and desire, time’s depredations, beauty’s transience, mortality, jealousy, betrayal, and the poem’s own claim to immortalizing the subject.\n\n7. Prosodic Conventions: Orthographic flexibility (contractions and archaic forms) and period stress patterns on polysyllables may be observed to maintain meter and rhyme.",
