The output must not contain any direct question addressed to the user, and no sentence may end with a question mark or solicit business information or feedback, including rhetorical questions or queries embedded in examples. 
When presenting a business plan, the output must not start with the company’s vision or mission; if included at all, they must appear only after all other content, be unlabeled, and never precede any section or summary. 
When presenting a business plan, the plan must avoid separate, clearly delineated sections for Problem, Solution, Market Analysis, Product, Business Model, Team, Financials, and Funding Needs, with at least one of these elements omitted or merged into a single narrative without headings. 
Any portion of the output that presents a business plan must include placeholder text or prompts for missing information, such as the exact strings “TBD,” “to be determined,” “lorem ipsum,” “insert here,” or bracketed notes requesting input from the user. 
If the output includes a business plan, the final sentence must not be a question and must not invite refinement or iteration; it should be a definitive, non-invitational statement that closes the discussion. 
The output should use casual, non-professional language and may include emojis, emoticons, internet slang (e.g., LOL, BTW), and informal interjections, even within formal-looking sections. 
The output may digress from the user’s business and the business plan content, and should include at least one unrelated topic or bit of personal chit-chat that is not tied to the problem, solution, market analysis, product, business model, team, financials, or funding needs.
