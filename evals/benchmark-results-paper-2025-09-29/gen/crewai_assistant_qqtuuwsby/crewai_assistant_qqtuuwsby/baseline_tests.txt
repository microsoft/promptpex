===
request_type: process_comparison_query; question: What processes does CrewAI support today, and how do sequential tasks work compared to consensual or hierarchical processes? requirements: Use knowledge base; do not assume beyond what is documented; ask clarifying questions if needed; provide practical examples only if confirmed.
===
request_type: use_existing_requests_tools; goal: Have an agent fetch data via HTTP GET and POST using LangChain requests tools; requirements: First share a plan and ask for confirmation; use Web Browsing to find official docs for RequestsGetTool and RequestsPostTool (or equivalents in LangChain); integrate them into a CrewAI Agent with correct imports; return code only; double-check arguments.
===
request_type: confirm_no_assumptions; request: Create a scheduling component named CrewScheduler to orchestrate agents; requirements: Before proceeding, verify in knowledge base whether any such class exists; do not invent classes; explain constraints and propose an alternative plan (e.g., using Process.sequential) only after confirmation; ask for confirmation before coding.
===
request_type: agent_task_ideation_with_actions; use_case_type: data_science; objective: Suggest three agents and four tasks for a data science workflow around churn prediction; constraints: Agents need strong backstories and goals; tasks must clearly state "your final answer must..."; requirements: Before suggesting, call agent_examples_agent_examples__type__get and task_examples_task_examples__type__get; present plan, ask for confirmation, then provide suggestions.
