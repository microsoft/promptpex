    "coverageText": "You haven’t yet told me what your specific goals are for this paragraph or what kind of feedback you’d like (for example, clarity, style, or organization). Could you let me know:\n\n1. What you want this essay to achieve (persuade, inform, raise awareness, etc.)  \n2. The type of feedback you need (detailed line edits, big-picture structure advice, tone adjustments, etc.)\n\nOverview  \nBecause you’re writing a short essay for a general audience about climate change’s effects on farmers, I’ll focus on clarity, correct usage, and logical flow. Once I know your goals (persuade, inform, etc.), I can fine-tune tone and evidence.\n\nOverall Feedback  \n• Your main idea—climate change harming farmers—is clear, but the paragraph reads as a rough draft.  \n• Spelling and word choice mistakes distract the reader.  \n• Sentences are brief and choppy; they’d flow better if rephrased or combined.  \n• It’s fine to note that you’ll add data later, but outline where evidence will go to strengthen your argument.\n\nSpelling Edits  \n• “alot” → “a lot” (spelling): “alot” is nonstandard; the correct form is two words.  \n• “effecting” → “affecting” (word choice/usage): “to affect” means to influence, whereas “effect” is usually a noun meaning result.  \n• “its” → “it’s” (spelling/grammar): you need the contraction “it is,” so include an apostrophe.\n\nGrammar Edits  \n• “Weather is affecting farmers a lot.” → “Weather is affecting farmers a lot.” (grammar/clarity): ensure subject-verb clarity; “weather” needs no article here.  \n• “The data are scattered” → “The data are scattered” or “The data is scattered” (number agreement/style): modern usage often treats “data” as a singular mass noun; choose based on your style guide.  \n• “I don’t know if its good.” → “I don’t know if it’s good.” (grammar): add apostrophe for contraction.  \n\nStructural Suggestions  \n• Combine sentences for smoother flow. For example, merge sentences 2 and 3:  \n  “Weather is affecting farmers a lot, and the data I’ve collected are scattered; I plan to add more later.”  \n  – This reduces choppiness and connects ideas clearly.  \n• Introduce context at the start: briefly define why climate change matters to farmers before stating the problem.  \n• End with a transitional sentence that previews what data or examples you’ll include next, giving the paragraph more purpose.\n\nOpportunities for Improvement  \n• Add a concrete example or statistic to illustrate how weather patterns have shifted (e.g., “last year’s drought cost Midwestern farmers X billion dollars”).  \n• Use a more engaging opening—perhaps a short scenario or a startling fact.  \n• Include a clear thesis or purpose sentence stating what you intend this essay to show or argue.\n\nFormatting Guidance  \n• For a general-public essay, keep paragraphs around 3–5 sentences.  \n• Use consistent tense (present tense when discussing current effects).  \n• If you quote data or reports later, follow a simple citation style (e.g., “According to USDA (2023)…”).  \n• Leave a blank line between paragraphs for readability online.\n\nWould you like me to produce a fully revised version of your paragraph incorporating these edits and suggestions? And do you need any more guidance or another round of feedback after that?",

    "coverageText": "Overview  \nBased on your goal to strengthen thesis clarity and persuasive impact for a high-school teacher audience, I’ll focus on sharpening your central claim, improving logical flow with stronger transitions, and ensuring each sentence supports your argument consistently.\n\nOverall Feedback  \nYour main idea—that school uniforms reduce bullying—is clear but could be stated more forcefully and specifically. Right now, the three sentences read like notes rather than a cohesive introduction. You need a precise thesis that previews your supporting points, plus smoother links between ideas. With targeted edits, you can turn this into a compelling opening that convinces your reader of both the problem and your solution.\n\nSpelling Edits  \n• No spelling errors detected in the provided text. (Issue: spelling – your word choices are all correctly spelled.)\n\nGrammar Edits  \n• Line 2: “However my thesis is vague” → add a comma after “However”: “However, my thesis is vague.” (Issue: punctuation – introductory adverb ‘However’ should be followed by a comma.)  \n• Line 3: “I don’t consistently support claims.” → consider “I don’t consistently back up my claims.” (Issue: word choice – “back up” clarifies that you need evidence; maintains conversational tone.)  \n• Throughout: replace contractions (“don’t”) with either full forms (“do not”) or remain consistent based on your tone. (Issue: style – choose one form for formality consistency.)\n\nStructural Suggestions  \n• Combine and expand the first two ideas into a single, clear thesis statement:  \n  – For example, “Adopting school uniforms in our district will reduce bullying, foster a stronger sense of community, and help students focus on learning.”  \n  – This change improves coherence by presenting all your main points in one place.  \n• Add a brief opening sentence or question to hook the reader:  \n  – For example, “Every day, thousands of students face bullying over their clothing choices.”  \n  – A hook frames the problem before you propose your solution, improving flow.  \n• Follow your thesis with a roadmap sentence that outlines the structure of your essay:  \n  – “In this essay, I will show how uniforms curb peer pressure, build school spirit, and allow teachers to concentrate on teaching.”  \n  – This guides the reader and sets clear expectations.\n\nOpportunities for Improvement  \n• Evidence and examples: Plan to include specific statistics or anecdotes about bullying incidents and uniform policies.  \n• Transitions: Use words like “moreover,” “in addition,” and “consequently” to link paragraphs.  \n• Tone: Maintain a confident stance—avoid phrases like “I think” or “I feel,” and state your claims directly.  \n• Counterarguments: Briefly acknowledge opposing views (e.g., on freedom of expression) and refute them to strengthen persuasion.\n\nFormatting Guidance  \n• Introduction paragraph structure: hook → context → thesis → roadmap.  \n• Use 12-point, readable font (e.g., Times New Roman) and 1-inch margins for a formal essay.  \n• Number your paragraphs or use clear topic sentences at the start of each body paragraph.  \n• If you cite statistics, follow MLA or APA style as instructed by your teacher.\n\nWould you like me to produce a fully revised version of this introduction that incorporates these suggestions?

    "coverageText": "Overview  \nBased on your goal to convey authenticity while staying concise in a personal statement for a college admissions committee, this critique focuses on clarity, tone, and structural unity. We’ll examine how each sentence supports your central message, ensure your passion for biology shines without slipping into arrogance, and offer ways to tighten or reshape the text for maximum impact.\n\nOverall Feedback  \nYour opening lines set a solid foundation: you introduce resilience and curiosity right away. However, the current draft reads more like notes about your concerns than a cohesive personal statement. To engage an admissions reader, turn reflections into active storytelling. Replace meta-commentary (“I’m not sure…”) with specific experiences that illustrate resilience, curiosity, and your passion for biology. Keep the tone confident yet humble by showing rather than telling.\n\nSpelling Edits  \n• No spelling errors detected. Great job on accuracy!\n\nGrammar Edits  \n• No grammatical errors detected. The sentences are clear and correctly constructed.\n\nStructural Suggestions  \n• Combine the first two sentences for a stronger, more fluid lead. For example, merge “Growing up in a small town taught me resilience and curiosity” with your biology passion to create a single opening that ties background to interest. This improves flow by immediately linking your upbringing to your academic goal.  \n• Remove the third sentence (“I’m not sure if my anecdotes…fits my audience”) from the statement itself. It reads as writer’s notes instead of part of the narrative. Instead, choose one anecdote that shows authenticity and weave it into the paragraph to demonstrate your tone naturally.  \n• Create a brief concluding sentence or transition that points forward—such as how you will build on resilience and curiosity in college—so the paragraph feels complete and purposeful.\n\nOpportunities for Improvement  \n• Add a specific anecdote: Describe a moment in your small town when you tackled a biology question or experiment. Concrete details (setting, dialogue, outcome) will illustrate resilience and curiosity better than abstract statements.  \n• Balance humility and confidence: Show challenges you overcame rather than saying you don’t want to sound arrogant. Let your actions and reflections speak for your character.  \n• Strengthen transitions: Use linking phrases (“This experience led me to…,” “Inspired by that challenge…”) to connect your background, your passion for biology, and your future goals.\n\nFormatting Guidance  \n• Use a single, focused paragraph for this opening unless you expand beyond 100–150 words.  \n• Begin with a vivid scene or brief story rather than a summary statement to hook the reader immediately.  \n• Keep sentence length varied—mix short, punchy sentences with slightly longer, descriptive ones to maintain reader interest.  \n• If this is the first paragraph, consider ending with a line that sets up the next section of your personal statement (for example, your academic goals or campus involvement).\n\nWould you like further assistance refining these ideas, more detailed structural edits, or a full rewritten version of your text incorporating these suggestions?

Correcting these errors and refining a few phrases will make your message look more polished and ensure the hiring manager focuses on your strengths.  \n\nSpelling Edits  \n- “definately” → “definitely”  \n  Issue type: spelling. Rationale: The correct sequence is “def-in-ite-ly.”  \n- “recieve” → “receive”  \n  Issue type: spelling. Rationale: English follows “i before e except after c.”  \n- “seperate” → “separate”  \n  Issue type: spelling. Rationale: “Separate” uses “a” in the first syllable, not “e.”  \n- “occured” → “occurred”  \n  Issue type: spelling. Rationale: This verb requires two c’s and two r’s in the past tense.  \n- “acheivements” → “achievements”  \n  Issue type: spelling. Rationale: “Achievement” follows the “i before e” rule because it comes after “v.”  \n\nGrammar Edits  \n- Original: “I managed separate projects where delays occurred frequently, but I adapted quickly.”  \n  Suggested: “I managed separate projects that were frequently delayed, but I adapted quickly.”  \n  Issue type: grammar/clarity. Rationale: Use “that were … delayed” instead of “where” to refer properly to “projects.”  \n- Original: “hope to receive a response soon.”  \n  Suggested: “look forward to hearing from you soon.”  \n  Issue type: usage/formality. Rationale: “Look forward to hearing” is the standard, polite phrasing in formal letters.  \n\nStructural Suggestions  \n- Introduce the specific position and company first. For example, start with “I am definitely interested in the [Job Title] role at [Company Name].” This places your subject right away for clarity.  \n- Combine short statements into one flow. Instead of three one-sentence bullets, group related ideas: interest, adaptability, and achievements can form two connected sentences that read more smoothly.  \n- End with a call to action. Move “My resume highlights my achievements” to follow your adaptability example, then conclude with your eagerness to discuss further. This creates a logical progression: interest → skills → next steps.  \n\nOpportunities for Improvement  \n- Add specific metrics or examples (e.g., “I reduced project delays by 20%”) to illustrate your adaptability.  \n- Vary sentence beginnings to avoid repeating “I” too often—use transition words like “Additionally” or “Moreover.”  \n- Strengthen your closing by mentioning why you’re a great fit for this particular company culture or role.  \n\nFormatting Guidance  \n- Use a standard business letter layout: your contact information at the top, date, hiring manager’s name and address, salutation, body paragraphs, a polite closing (e.g., “Sincerely,”), and your typed name.  \n- Keep paragraphs to three or four clear lines—dense blocks can be hard to read.  \n- Choose a professional font (e.g., Arial or Times New Roman) at 11–12 pt, and maintain one-inch margins.  \n\nWould you like further assistance or more detailed changes?

You can strengthen clarity by ensuring verbs agree with their subjects, keeping tenses consistent, fixing dangling modifiers, and breaking up run-on sentences. Also consider adding brief reflections on what you learned.\n\nSpelling Edits  \n• No spelling errors found.\n\nGrammar Edits  \n• “The results shows that I was successful in the project.”  \n  – Corrected: “The results show that I was successful in the project.”  \n  – Issue: subject-verb agreement. “Results” is plural, so the verb must be “show” (grammar).\n\n• “I was working on the report and finish it yesterday.”  \n  – Corrected: “I was working on the report and finished it yesterday.”  \n  – Issue: parallel structure and tense consistency. Both verbs should match in tense, so use “finished” (tense consistency).\n\n• “Running quickly, the finish line seemed far.”  \n  – Corrected: “As I ran quickly, the finish line seemed far away.”  \n  – Issue: dangling modifier. The original makes the “finish line” do the running. By naming “I” as the runner, the meaning is clear (clarity).\n\n• “The team were excited, we celebrated and it was great.”  \n  – Corrected: “The team was excited. We celebrated, and it was great.”  \n  – Issue: subject-verb agreement (“team” is singular in American English) and comma splice. Splitting into two sentences or using a semicolon prevents the run-on (grammar, style).\n\nStructural Suggestions  \n• Begin with a brief context sentence. For example, start with “When I completed the final draft of my project report, I felt a mix of relief and pride.” This sets up what follows (coherence).  \n• Combine or expand reflections. After noting success, add a sentence on what you learned: “This process taught me the importance of time management and peer feedback.” This deepens the essay’s reflective purpose (development).  \n• End with a concluding thought. Rather than stopping at celebration, finish by linking back to your growth: “Overall, the experience has made me more confident in handling complex tasks.” A conclusion gives closure (flow).\n\nOpportunities for Improvement  \n• Clarity: Specify which part of the project challenged you most.  \n• Evidence: Give one concrete example of feedback you received or a problem you solved.  \n• Transitions: Use words such as “then,” “next,” or “finally” to guide the reader through your steps.  \n• Tone: Since this is for your teacher, a slightly more formal voice—avoiding “it was great”—can strengthen your professionalism.\n\nFormatting Guidance  \n• Paragraphing: Group related ideas into one paragraph—context and your action in the first, reflection and conclusion in the second.  \n• Title: Add a clear heading like “Reflections on My Project Experience.”  \n• Spacing: Leave a blank line between paragraphs for readability.  \n• If you reference any sources or feedback, use a simple citation style (teacher’s preference) like parentheses or footnotes.\n\nWould you like me to generate a revised version of your text incorporating these suggestions?

I’ll also suggest ways to expand your points with evidence and improve flow between observations.\n\nOverall Feedback  \nYour draft identifies key issues with the experiment and points out limitations, which is a good start. To strengthen it for an academic audience, tighten the language by removing casual phrases (“kind of”), fix subject-verb agreement, and replace vague judgments (“it’s good”) with precise evaluations. Reorganize sentences so that related ideas (data issues, recording methods, limitations) are grouped together, and add brief explanations or examples to support your claims.\n\nSpelling Edits  \n• In “The experiment was sucssesful…” (line 1): change “sucssesful” to “successful.”  \n  – Issue type: spelling. “Successful” is the correct spelling.  \n\nGrammar Edits  \n• In “we was recording at different times” (line 2): change “was” to “were.”  \n  – Issue type: grammar (subject-verb agreement). “We” is plural, so the verb must be “were.”  \n\n• In “The data is inconsistent” (line 2): consider “The data are inconsistent.”  \n  – Issue type: grammar/style. In formal writing, “data” is often treated as a plural noun.  \n\n• In “This study have many limitations” (line 4): change “have” to “has.”  \n  – Issue type: grammar (subject-verb agreement). “Study” is singular, so use “has.”  \n\nStructural Suggestions  \n• Combine comments on data and recording times into a single sentence.  \n  – Example: “The data are inconsistent because we recorded observations at different times.”  \n  – Improves coherence by linking cause and effect.  \n\n• Merge the limitation statements into one concise paragraph.  \n  – Example: “Although the experiment was successful, it suffered from inconsistent data collection and timing, which limits the reliability of our conclusions.”  \n  – Creates a stronger, unified argument.  \n\n• Place the suggestion about shortening the introduction in a transition sentence or footnote rather than the body.  \n  – Keeps the analytical essay focused on content rather than writing process.  \n\nOpportunities for Improvement  \n• Replace vague terms (“kind of messy,” “it’s good”) with specific descriptions or evaluations.  \n• Add a brief example: what exactly made the procedure “messy”? Detailing one step will strengthen your critique.  \n• Use transitions (“However,” “Moreover,” “Therefore”) to guide the reader through your analysis.  \n• Draw a clearer connection between limitations and their impact on your overall findings.  \n\nFormatting Guidance  \n• Divide your essay into clear paragraphs: Introduction, Methods, Results/Observations, Limitations, Conclusion.  \n• Use formal tone: avoid contractions like “it’s” in favor of “it is.”  \n• Consider adding headings for each section to help classmates follow your structure.  \n• Maintain consistent spacing and citation style if you refer to external sources.  \n\nWould you like me to generate a rewritten version of your text that incorporates these changes?

    "coverageText": "Overview\nThis feedback will help you create a smooth, past-tense narrative with a consistent tone. Because your piece is a narrative essay for general readers, we’ll standardize verbs to past tense, replace casual slang with more formal word choices, and suggest ways to arrange your ideas so the story flows clearly from beginning to end.\n\nOverall Feedback\nYour draft shows a lively story idea, but the tense jumps between present, past, and future, which can confuse readers. The tone also shifts from casual (“gonna”) to formal (“felt awesome”), making the voice feel uneven. Focus on telling the events in one consistent tense—past tense works well for a narrative of something that already happened—and choose either a conversational or a more polished style, then stick with it throughout. You can strengthen the flow by ordering your sentences chronologically and grouping your reflections at the end.\n\nSpelling Edits\n• “gonna” → “going to”  \n  Issue: spelling/slang. Rationale: “gonna” is informal and nonstandard. Use “going to” for clarity and tone consistency.\n\nGrammar Edits\n• “Yesterday I walk to the beach” → “Yesterday I walked to the beach”  \n  Issue: tense consistency. Rationale: change present “walk” to past “walked” to match a past-tense frame.  \n\n• “I am watching the waves” → “I watched the waves”  \n  Issue: tense consistency. Rationale: shift present continuous to simple past for a uniform past narrative.  \n\n• “later I will wrote about it” → “later I will write about it” or “later I wrote about it”  \n  Issue: incorrect verb form. Rationale: “wrote” is past; with “will,” you need the base form “write.” If you want a pure past narrative, choose “later I wrote about it.”  \n\n• “I'm gonna add more details” → “I added more details” or “I was going to add more details”  \n  Issue: tense and style. Rationale: replace slang and match past tense (“added”) or use the full phrase “going to” with past (“I was going to add”).  \n\n• “it felt awesome, but the structure is all over the place” → “it felt awesome, but the structure was all over the place”  \n  Issue: tense consistency. Rationale: change present “is” to past “was.”  \n\n• “I start with the ending” → “I started with the ending”  \n  Issue: tense consistency. Rationale: change present “start” to past “started.”  \n\n• “The style switches between casual and formal.” → “The style switched between casual and formal.”  \n  Issue: tense consistency. Rationale: change present “switches” to past “switched.”\n\nStructural Suggestions\n• Reorder chronologically: begin with “Yesterday I walked to the beach and watched the waves,” then explain what you did next. Rationale: a clear timeline helps readers follow the story.  \n• Group your writing reflections at the end: move comments about structure and tone after the action. Rationale: separating the narrative from your analysis keeps the story focused and then allows a tidy reflection.  \n• Consider combining short, related sentences: for example, merge details about adding material and feeling excitement (“I added more details because I felt awesome”) for stronger flow. Rationale: avoids choppy rhythm and reinforces connection between ideas.\n\nOpportunities for Improvement\n• Add sensory details: describe the color of the water, the sound of waves, or the smell of salt air. Rationale: engages readers and brings the scene to life.  \n• Use transitions: words like “then,” “afterward,” or “later” guide readers through the sequence of events. Rationale: makes the narrative smoother.  \n• Decide on a tone: if you choose a conversational style, keep contractions like “I’m” but use standard words; if you choose formal, avoid slang entirely. Rationale: consistency in voice builds reader trust.  \n• Show rather than tell: instead of “it felt awesome,” illustrate why—“The sun warmed my back as I watched the waves crash.” Rationale: creates a vivid picture and deeper connection.\n\nFormatting Guidance\n• Break into paragraphs: start a new paragraph for the beach scene, another for your writing process, and a final one for reflections.  \n• Indent or add a blank line between paragraphs to signal shifts in focus.  \n• If this is a submitted essay, double-space your text and use a standard font (Times New Roman, 12 pt) with one-inch margins.  \n• For the title, center it and use sentence capitalization (e.g., “A Day at the Beach”).\n\nWould you like me to generate a revised version of your text that incorporates these suggestions?

I will look at how you introduce your research question, order background, methods, results, and conclusion, and eliminate duplicated points.

Background information and methods appear too late, while the research question is introduced after results.  \n- You also repeat points in background and conclusion, which weakens your summary’s clarity.  \n- By moving each element into the typical IMRaD (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion/Conclusion) order, you’ll create a smoother, more professional structure.\n\nSpelling Edits  \n- None detected. Your text does not contain any misspelled words.\n\nGrammar Edits  \n- “The results section lists three key findings, then I introduce my research question.”  \n  • Issue type: tense consistency and point of view  \n  • Rationale: You switch between third-person present (“lists”) and first-person present (“I introduce”).

To persuade local readers, you’ll need to:\n  • Hook your audience with a brief anecdote or striking fact in the introduction.  \n  • Back up each benefit with specific examples, statistics, or comparisons (for instance, “In City X, park visits rose by 30% after recent upgrades”).  \n  • Smoothly guide readers from one point to the next with transition phrases (e.g., “Moreover,” “In addition,” “On the other hand”).  \n  • Keep a consistent tone—friendly but authoritative—from start to finish.  \n  • End with a clear call to action that tells readers what you want them to do (attend a city council meeting, sign a petition, volunteer for a parks group).\n\nSpelling Edits  \n- No misspellings detected. (Spelling) Your text is free of spelling errors.\n\nGrammar Edits  \n- No grammatical errors detected. (Grammar) Your sentences are structurally correct, though you can improve rhythm and emphasis by varying sentence length in a full draft.\n\nStructural Suggestions  \n- Introduction: Line 1 (“Our city should invest in parks.”)  \n  Recommendation: Expand this with a one-sentence hook (e.g., “Last summer, I watched families crowd our only park because it’s the only green space left in town.”) to draw readers in before stating your thesis.  \n  How it helps: A relatable scenario or statistic makes your thesis more compelling.  \n\n- Benefit Sections: Lines 2–3 (“The benefits are many… tone shifts abruptly.”)  \n  Recommendation: Break this into separate paragraphs, each focused on one benefit (health, community, property values). Start each with a topic sentence, follow with an example or statistic, then use a transition.  \n  How it helps: Clear organization and evidence make each point stand out and feel credible.  \n\n- Transitions: Line 3 (“Transitions between paragraphs are weak…”)  \n  Recommendation: At the end of each paragraph, add a linking sentence—e.g., “Beyond health improvements, parks also boost our local economy.”  \n  How it helps: Readers will move smoothly from one idea to the next without feeling jolted.  \n\n- Conclusion: Add a final paragraph that restates your main point, sums up key benefits in one or two sentences, and issues a specific call to action (“Ask your neighbor to join you at the council meeting on May 5th and speak up for new parks.”).  \n  How it helps: Wraps up your argument with momentum and tells readers exactly how to act.\n\nOpportunities for Improvement  \n- Use data from local government or respected organizations to show real numbers (park usage, crime reduction, health metrics).  \n- Include a brief comparison to a nearby city of similar size that saw positive results after park investment.  \n- Add a personal anecdote (yours or a neighbor’s) to appeal to readers’ emotions.  \n- Make sure each paragraph begins with a strong topic sentence and ends with a transition.  \n- Maintain a consistent tone—avoid shifting between conversational (“I want”) and formal (“should invest”).\n\nFormatting Guidance  \n- Opinion essays for newspapers typically run 400–600 words and use no subheaders—stick to short, punchy paragraphs (3–5 sentences each).  \n- If you cite statistics or studies, include the source in parentheses or as a brief footnote.  \n- Italicize the names of study reports or publications.  \n- Leave a blank line between paragraphs for easier reading in print layout.\n\nWould you like me to generate a revised version of your text that incorporates these suggestions?

We’ll start by fixing grammar and wording line by line. Then we’ll suggest ways to build a clearer thesis, add supporting details, and improve overall flow so your argument comes across more convincingly.\n\nOverall Feedback  \n• Your opening statement needs stronger subject-verb agreement and punctuation for clarity.  \n• The thesis (“the policy should change”) is clear but undeveloped—readers need more specifics and evidence.  \n• Right now you have two short sentences; expanding each into a full paragraph will help you persuade.  \n• Consider adding examples (taste tests, student surveys) or data (nutrition studies, complaints count) to support your claim.  \n\nSpelling Edits  \n• No spelling errors detected. Good job on the individual words!\n\nGrammar Edits  \n• “School lunches is healthy” → “School lunches are healthy”  \n  – Issue: subject-verb agreement (grammar). “Lunches” is plural, so use “are.”  \n• “but they taste bad and students is complaining.” → “, but they taste bad, and students are complaining.”  \n  – Issue: comma usage for compound sentence (grammar/clarity). Added commas before “but” and between clauses for readability.  \n  – Issue: subject-verb agreement: changed “students is” to “students are.”  \n• “I think the policy should change though I don’t know how.” → “I think the policy should change; however, I’m not sure exactly how.”  \n  – Issue: run-on/transition (style). Using “; however,” clarifies the contrast and separates complete thoughts.\n\nStructural Suggestions  \n• Combine your first two sentences into a clear introductory paragraph. Start with a hook (e.g., “Every day, students fill half their plates—and leave the rest untouched.”) then state your thesis. This will improve flow.  \n• After your introduction, add a paragraph outlining why healthy lunches matter (nutrition benefits, academic focus). This builds ethos.  \n• Follow with a paragraph describing the current complaint—what students taste and how they react. Include an example or brief survey result to strengthen logos.  \n• Finally, propose one or two specific policy changes (alter the menu rotation, involve student taste tests). This gives readers a clear call to action and possible solutions.  \n\nOpportunities for Improvement  \n• Evidence: Cite at least one study or school-district data point on nutrition and student satisfaction.  \n• Examples: Include a short quote from a student complaining about a particular meal.  \n• Transitions: Use phrases like “Furthermore,” “In contrast,” and “Therefore” to connect your ideas.  \n• Tone: Aim for confident persuasion—replace “I don’t know how” with “Here is one way we can begin.”  \n\nFormatting Guidance  \n• Divide your essay into Introduction, Body (2–3 paragraphs), and Conclusion.  \n• Use one-inch margins, 12-point readable font (Times New Roman or Arial), and double-space lines.  \n• For any sources or data, include a simple in-text citation (e.g., “(Smith, 2023)”) and a References list at the end.  \n• Number each page and include a header with your last name and page number in the top right.\n\nWould you like me to generate a fully revised version of your text incorporating these changes?

Splitting into two sentences or using a semicolon prevents a run-on structure.  \n• Subject-verb agreement in “we needs balance.”  \n  – Suggested fix: “we need balance.”  \n  – Issue: grammar.

Balanced solution (your proposal)  \n  – Explanation: A five-part structure keeps your audience oriented and builds a logical case.  \n• Move your thesis (“homework is necessary but needs balance”) to the end of the introduction for maximum impact.  \n  – Explanation: Placing the thesis last in the intro creates a strong “what to expect” moment for listeners.  \n• Combine short supporting points into bullet-style notes (for your speaker outline) rather than one dense sentence.  \n  – Explanation: This makes it easier to rehearse and deliver key ideas clearly.  \n\nOpportunities for Improvement  \n• Add a brief anecdote or rhetorical question at the start (“Have you ever wondered why homework feels overwhelming?”) to draw in your audience.  \n• Include one or two statistics or examples (e.g., average homework hours, studies on effectiveness) to strengthen your argument.  \n• Use transitions (“First,” “Furthermore,” “However,” “In conclusion”) to guide the listener through each part of your speech.  \n• Address possible objections (e.g., “Some might say less homework lowers grades—here’s why that isn’t necessarily true”).  \n• End with a call to action directed at the committee (e.g., “I invite you to adopt a balanced homework policy…”).  \n\nFormatting Guidance  \n• Break your speech into labeled sections in your speaker notes: Introduction, Main Points, Counterargument, Conclusion.  \n• Use bullet points or numbered lists for your main talking points—these are cues, not full sentences.  \n• Keep each line on your note card or slide to one idea, so you don’t read a wall of text.  \n• If you include a quotation or statistic, format it in quotation marks or italics and note the source briefly.  \n• Leave white space on your notes for quick annotations or emphasis marks during delivery.  \n\nWould you like me to generate a revised version of your speech draft that incorporates these changes?  \nWould you also like further assistance, additional changes, or more guidance?",

    "coverageText": "Overview  \nBased on your request, I’ll focus on a close copyedit of your short narrative, with particular attention to spelling. I’ll also note any grammar points, suggest ways to strengthen the structure, point out broader opportunities for improvement, and give formatting tips suited to a brief narrative.\n\nOverall Feedback  \nYour two-sentence story sets a clear scene and delivers a relatable moment. Right now, spelling errors distract the reader from the content. Once spelling is fixed, you can consider adding small details (time of day, why you were excited) to make the narrative more engaging. The tone is conversational and works well for a personal narrative.\n\nSpelling Edits  \n- “libary” → “library”  \n  Issue type: spelling. “Library” is the correct standard spelling.  \n- “freind” → “friend”  \n  Issue type: spelling. “Friend” follows the i-before-e rule.  \n- “definetly” → “definitely”  \n  Issue type: spelling. The correct form has an extra “i” after the n.  \n- “suprise” → “surprise”  \n  Issue type: spelling. The correct form drops the extra “u” after the s.\n\nGrammar Edits  \n- “they didn’t show” → “they didn’t show up”  \n  Issue type: grammar/clarity. Adding “up” completes the phrasal verb and sounds more natural.  \n- Pronoun clarity “they”  \n  Issue type: clarity. “They” works fine as a gender-neutral singular pronoun. If you know your friend’s gender and prefer “he” or “she,” you could swap that pronoun for precision.\n\nStructural Suggestions  \n- Combine for emphasis:  \n  Suggested change: “To my surprise, when I went to the library to meet my friend, they didn’t show up.”  \n  Benefit: Opens with the surprise, then fills in context, creating a stronger hook and smoother flow.  \n- Expand emotional detail:  \n  After the second sentence, you might add a line about how you felt—confused, disappointed, or worried—to deepen reader engagement.\n\nOpportunities for Improvement  \n- Add sensory details (What did the library smell or sound like?) to ground readers in the scene.  \n- Show, don’t tell: Instead of “It was definitely a surprise,” you could describe your heart racing or your eyes scanning the empty bench.  \n- Provide brief backstory: Why did you choose that time or place? A few words can help readers connect.\n\nFormatting Guidance  \n- Paragraph breaks: Even in a very short narrative, separate your setup (going to the library) from your reaction (surprise) into two lines or paragraphs to guide the reader’s eye.  \n- Dialogue or thought formatting (if you add internal thoughts): Use italics or quotation marks consistently, e.g., I wondered, “Where is Alex?”  \n- Keep tense consistent: You’ve used past tense correctly—continue that for any future additions.\n\nCould you share your main goals for this narrative and let me know what type of feedback (tone, pacing, character detail, etc.) you need next? Would you like me to generate a fully revised version of this text incorporating all these edits? And is there anything else I can help you with?",

I’ll help you choose and stick to one tense, correct irregular verbs, and improve agreement between subjects and verbs.  \n\nSpelling Edits  \n• “buyed” → “bought”  \n  ­ Issue type: spelling/verb form  \n  ­ Rationale: “Buy” is an irregular verb; its past tense is “bought,” not “buyed.”  \n\nGrammar Edits  \n• “I was going, then I go to the store,” → consider “I was going to the store” or “I went to the store.”  \n  ­ Issue type: tense consistency  \n  ­ Rationale: Mixing past continuous (“was going”) with present simple (“go”) confuses the timeline. Pick one tense.  \n• “buyed apples” → “bought apples”  \n  ­ Issue type: verb form  \n  ­ Rationale: Corrects the irregular past-tense form of “buy.”  \n• “that is fresh” → “that are fresh” or “which are fresh”  \n  ­ Issue type: subject-verb agreement  \n  ­ Rationale: “Apples” is plural, so you need “are” instead of “is.”  \n• Comma splice in “I was going, then I go to the store”  \n  ­ Issue type: run-on sentence  \n  ­ Rationale: Two independent ideas shouldn’t be joined by just a comma. You can use a conjunction or split into two sentences.  \n\nStructural Suggestions  \n• Combine actions in one flowing sentence: “I went to the store and bought fresh apples.”  \n  ­ Improves coherence by using a single past-tense narrative.  \n• Or split into two clear sentences:  \n  “I was going to the store. I bought fresh apples.”  \n  ­ Provides emphasis and avoids run-ons.  \n\nOpportunities for Improvement  \n• Add context or detail: Why were you going? For whom?  \n• Vary sentence structure: You could start with a reason (e.g., “Because I was out of fruit, I went to the store and bought fresh apples.”)  \n• Use descriptive language: Describe the apples or the store to paint a clearer picture.  \n\nFormatting Guidance  \n• Ensure each sentence starts with a capital letter and ends with a period.  \n• Keep one idea per sentence for clarity.  \n• For longer writing, separate paragraphs by topic or action.  \n\nWould you like me to generate a fully revised version of this sentence?

    "coverageText": "Overview  \nThis feedback focuses on clarifying your one-sentence opening by fixing subject-verb agreement, article use, and verb forms. I’ll also suggest ways to break the sentence for better flow and add small details to engage readers.\n\nBefore we begin, could you tell me:  \n- What is your goal for this story opening? (e.g., a children’s tale, a sci-fi short story, a writing exercise)  \n- What kind of feedback are you looking for? (e.g., grammar only, style and voice, plot development)\n\nOverall Feedback  \nYour sentence sets a clear idea—a boy dreaming of space—but it needs grammatical corrections and a stronger structure to make it flow smoothly. Breaking it into two sentences and choosing precise verbs will help readers connect with your character’s ambition right away.\n\nSpelling Edits  \n- No spelling errors detected. (Good job with all word spellings.)\n\nGrammar Edits  \n- “a boy who are dreams” → “a boy who dreams”  \n  Issue type: subject-verb agreement & clarity  \n  Rationale: “boy” is singular, so use “dreams” (not “are dreams”). Removing “are” also makes the phrase clearer.\n\n- “to be a astronaut” → “to be an astronaut”  \n  Issue type: article usage  \n  Rationale: “astronaut” begins with a vowel sound, so the correct article is “an.”\n\n- “he maybe will became” → “he may become” or “he might become”  \n  Issue type: verb form & modal verb usage  \n  Rationale: “became” is past tense; you want the infinitive “become.” Also, pair the modal “may” or “might” directly with the base verb for correct structure.\n\nStructural Suggestions  \n- Split into two sentences:  \n  Recommendation: Separate the boy’s dream from the possibility of it happening.  \n  How it helps: Two shorter sentences improve pacing and clarity.\n\n- Introduce a little context or detail:  \n  Recommendation: Add one descriptive phrase (e.g., “staring up at the night sky”) before mentioning his dream.  \n  How it helps: A vivid detail draws readers in and sets the scene immediately.\n\nOpportunities for Improvement  \n- Show instead of tell: Rather than stating “he dreams to be an astronaut,” describe what he does (e.g., “he sketches rockets in his notebook”).  \n- Add emotion or stakes: Why does he want to become an astronaut? A brief hint at his motivation makes the story more engaging.  \n- Transition words: If this opening follows a previous paragraph, consider using “Finally,” “Ever since,” or similar to tie it in smoothly.\n\nFormatting Guidance  \n- Paragraphing: For very short openings, one paragraph is fine. If you add more sentences, keep paragraphs to three to five sentences each.  \n- Punctuation: After splitting into two sentences, ensure each ends with a period.  \n- Title or heading: If this is the start of a short story, consider centering a title above this paragraph.\n\nWould you like me to generate a revised version of this sentence with all changes applied?  \nWould you like further assistance or more guidance on any part of this opening?",

For example, who is your intended audience, and are you aiming for a casual blog post, a formal essay, or something else? Knowing this will help me tailor my feedback and edits to what you need.\n\nOverview  \nBased on your snippet, I’ll focus on correcting tense and agreement errors, smoothing out dialect changes, and suggesting a clearer, more consistent structure. I’ll also give style tips to keep your tone coherent—either casual or formal—depending on your goal.\n\nOverall Feedback  \n• Your piece jumps between past and present tense, which can confuse readers. Picking a single tense (past for “yesterday” stories) will strengthen clarity.  \n• The shift from slang (“we be shopping”) to more formal phrasing feels abrupt. Deciding on one tone—casual or formal—and sticking with it will make the writing flow better.  \n• The structure is very brief and reads like a series of notes. Organizing it into a clear introduction, body, and conclusion will help readers follow your ideas.\n\nSpelling Edits  \n• No misspellings detected in the provided text. (Spelling—everything is spelled correctly.)\n\nGrammar Edits  \n• “Yesterday I go to market” → “Yesterday I went to the market.”  \n  – Issue: tense consistency and missing article (the). You describe a past event, so use past tense “went” and include “the” before “market.”  \n• “we be shopping” → “we were shopping.”  \n  – Issue: dialect/tense. Standard past continuous form is “were shopping,” which matches the past-tense narrative.  \n• “The essay jump around” → “The essay jumps around.”  \n  – Issue: subject-verb agreement and tense. The subject “essay” is singular, so the verb needs –s (“jumps”), and present tense can work if you’re describing the essay’s general behavior.  \n• “I write in casual slang, then formal.” → “I write in casual slang, then switch to a formal tone.”  \n  – Issue: clarity and style. Adding “switch to” and “tone” clearly signals the shift and makes the sentence more precise.\n\nStructural Suggestions  \n• Start with a clear topic sentence: introduce what you’ll discuss (e.g., “Yesterday, I visited the market, but I struggled to keep my writing style consistent.”). This frames the piece.  \n• Combine or expand: Rather than four separate fragments, expand each idea into its own sentence or two. For example, describe what happened at the market in one paragraph, then reflect on your writing style in the next.  \n• Add a conclusion: Wrap up by stating what you learned (e.g., “I realized that maintaining a single tense and tone helps my readers follow my story.”). This gives your piece a sense of closure.\n\nOpportunities for Improvement  \n• Transitions: Use words like “First,” “Next,” and “Finally” or phrases like “However” and “As a result” to guide readers smoothly from one point to the next.  \n• Detail and examples: Describe what you bought at the market or why you switched styles mid-essay to make your account more engaging.  \n• Tone consistency: Decide if you want a conversational or formal essay. If conversational, you can keep some slang but adjust spellings to match standard English rules. If formal, remove all slang.\n\nFormatting Guidance  \n• Paragraphing: Group related sentences into paragraphs (e.g., one for the market story, one for style reflection).  \n• Headings (for longer essays): If this grows into a longer piece, use headings like “Market Visit” and “Style Reflection” to organize content.  \n• Spacing: Leave a blank line between paragraphs for readability.  \n• Consistent punctuation: Make sure each sentence ends with a period, question mark, or exclamation point.\n\nWould you like me to produce a fully rewritten version of your text that incorporates these suggestions? Let me know if you need more detailed changes, additional guidance, or if you’d like me to adjust the tone further!",

To strengthen this argument, restate your claim with correct grammar, split it into shorter sentences, and follow up immediately with facts or examples. Then use linking words to smooth the transition between ideas. Finally, maintain a consistent, slightly formal tone throughout.  \n\nSpelling Edits  \n• No misspelled words were found in your text.  \n\nGrammar Edits  \n• “The argument say climate change is real” → “The argument says that climate change is real”  \n  – Issue: subject-verb agreement (grammar). “Argument” is singular, so the verb needs an “s.” Also adding “that” improves clarity.  \n• “but I don’t provide any data” → “but it does not provide any data”  \n  – Issue: pronoun reference and voice consistency (grammar). Shifting from “I” to “it” keeps the focus on the argument itself rather than the writer.  \n• “and the paragraphs is choppy.” → “and the paragraphs are choppy.”  \n  – Issue: number agreement (grammar). “Paragraphs” is plural, so use “are.”  \n\nStructural Suggestions  \n• Break into two or more sentences:  \n  – Suggestion: Move “However” to the start of the second sentence for a clear contrast.  \n  – How it helps: Shorter sentences improve readability and emphasize each point.  \n• Reorder for emphasis:  \n  – Suggestion: First state the claim, then note the lack of data, then mention flow issues.  \n  – How it helps: A logical sequence (claim → evidence gap → flow issue) makes your critique easier to follow.  \n• Expand each point into its own sentence or paragraph:  \n  – Suggestion: After noting “no data,” immediately follow with an example or placeholder where you will insert statistics.  \n  – How it helps: Separating ideas gives you room to develop each one fully.  \n\nOpportunities for Improvement  \n• Clarity: Define what “the argument” refers to—yours, someone else’s, or a general claim.  \n• Evidence: Add specific data (e.g., “According to the IPCC, global temperatures have risen by 1.1 °C since pre-industrial times.”)  \n• Examples: Reference a particular study, event, or statistic to illustrate real-world impact (for instance, melting glaciers in Greenland).  \n• Transitions: Use words like “however,” “furthermore,” or “in addition” to link ideas and guide the reader.  \n• Tone: Adopt a formal, objective style—avoid contractions (“does not” instead of “don’t”) and keep to third person.  \n\nFormatting Guidance  \n• Paragraphing: Keep each main idea in its own paragraph (claim, evidence, flow critique).  \n• Headings (if this is part of a longer essay): Use clear labels such as Introduction, Evidence, Discussion, Conclusion.  \n• Citations: When you add data, follow a consistent style (APA, MLA, or Chicago) for in-text citations and a reference list.  \n• Spacing and indentation: Use standard double-spacing and indent the first line of each paragraph if this is a school assignment.  \n\nCould you tell me more about your goals for this piece (audience, purpose) and what kind of feedback you’d like?

I think that while it helps us communicate, it also make us lonely, because we are scrolling instead of seeing each other. For example, I text my friends daily but I dont see them on weekend, which used to be normal before. This topic is very important because people are getting worse attention span and that affects school.

    "coverageText": "Overview  \nBased on your goals—strengthening the thesis, improving flow, and fixing grammar/tense issues in an argumentative essay excerpt for a high-school English teacher under MLA expectations—this edit focuses on  \n• sharpening your central claim (“thesis”)  \n• smoothing sentence and paragraph flow  \n• correcting spelling, grammar, and punctuation  \n• offering structural tweaks and MLA formatting reminders  \n\nOverall Feedback  \nYour paragraph has a clear personal voice and a relevant topic. To meet MLA and argumentative-essay expectations, you’ll want to:  \n• State a concise, arguable thesis at the end of your introduction.  \n• Ensure each sentence builds logically to your thesis.  \n• Use varied sentence structures and clear transitions.  \n• Maintain standard MLA conventions (in-text citations, punctuation, header).  \n\nSpelling Edits  \n• “In todays world” → “In today’s world”  \n  – Issue: missing apostrophe for possession (spelling).  \n• “I dont see them” → “I don’t see them”  \n  – Issue: missing apostrophe in contraction (spelling).  \n\nGrammar Edits  \n• “social media are making people more connected” → “social media is making people more connected”  \n  – Issue: collective noun agreement (grammar). “Social media” is treated as a singular concept.  \n• “but also more apart.” → “but also more disconnected.”  \n  – Issue: word choice for clarity (style). “Disconnected” more directly contrasts “connected.”  \n• “it also make us lonely” → “it also makes us lonely”  \n  – Issue: subject-verb agreement (grammar). Singular “it” needs “makes.”  \n• “I text my friends daily but I dont see them on weekend” → “I text my friends daily, but I don’t see them on the weekend”  \n  – Issue: comma before coordinating conjunction (grammar); missing article “the” (grammar); contraction spelling (see above).  \n• “which used to be normal before.” → “which used to be normal.”  \n  – Issue: redundant “before” after “used to” (conciseness).  \n• “people are getting worse attention span” → “people’s attention spans are getting worse”  \n  – Issue: possessive form and plural agreement (grammar); awkward word order (clarity).  \n• “Some people says social media is just a tool” → “Some people say social media is just a tool”  \n  – Issue: subject-verb agreement (grammar).  \n• “it depends how you use it” → “it depends on how you use it”  \n  – Issue: missing preposition (grammar).  \n• Citation placement: “addictive. (Turkle 45)” → “addictive (Turkle 45).”  \n  – Issue: period belongs after the full citation (MLA punctuation).  \n\nStructural Suggestions  \n• Move your thesis into a single, strong final sentence of the introduction.  \n  – Suggestion: End with “While social media helps us communicate across distances, its addictive design often leaves us lonelier and with shorter attention spans, which can hurt our academic focus.” This spotlights your argument and sets up the rest of the essay.  \n• Combine short, choppy sentences for better flow:  \n  – Merge “I think that while it helps us communicate, it also makes us lonely, because we are scrolling instead of seeing each other.” into one sentence for smoother rhythm.  \n• Add a brief context or statistic at the very start as a hook (“According to recent studies, students now scroll over three hours daily on social media.”).  \n  – Improves engagement and shows research backing.  \n• Use transitions to link ideas clearly:  \n  – For instance, begin the attention-span sentence with “Furthermore,” or “Consequently,” to signal cause and effect.  \n\nOpportunities for Improvement  \n• Provide a concrete example or brief anecdote about a specific weekend you missed with friends, to illustrate your point.  \n• Define key terms like “addictive design” so your audience knows exactly what features you mean.  \n• Vary sentence openings (adverbial phrases, questions) to keep reader interest.  \n• Insert a counter-argument sentence and then refute it, to strengthen your persuasive appeal (“Although some argue that user choice matters more than design, research shows…”).  \n\nFormatting Guidance  \n• MLA Header and Pagination: Your paper should have a top-left header with your name, instructor, course, and date, and a running header with your last name and page number in the top right.  \n• Font and Spacing: Use Times New Roman, 12 pt, double-spaced with 1-inch margins.  \n• In-Text Citations: Place citation immediately after the quoted or paraphrased material but before the period—no extra space before the parenthesis.  \n• Works Cited Placeholder: At the end, include a “Works Cited” page. List Turkle’s source in proper MLA format, even if you only place a placeholder entry for now.  \n\nWould you like me to produce a fully revised version of this excerpt incorporating these suggestions? Or do you need more targeted guidance on any of these points?",

    "coverageText": "Overview  \nThis feedback focuses on aligning your short fiction scene with your goals: maintaining a reflective, slightly whimsical first-person voice while improving tense consistency, sharpening clarity in descriptions, and correcting dialogue punctuation. I’ll provide line-by-line notes, pacing and structure suggestions, and show-vs-tell guidance, all tailored for a teen literary magazine submission in standard manuscript format.\n\nOverall Feedback  \nYour scene has a charming, immersive start, but shifts in tense and a string of short sentences sometimes interrupt the dreamy, reflective tone you’re aiming for. Strengthening sensory details and varying sentence length will heighten the whimsy. Clear, consistent tense and polished dialogue punctuation will help readers stay grounded in your narrator’s perspective and feel more connected to the moment at the arcade.\n\nSpelling Edits  \n• No spelling errors detected. (Spelling: the text’s word choices are correct.)\n\nGrammar Edits  \n• “I walk into the old arcade last night” → “I walked into the old arcade last night.”  \n  – Issue: tense consistency. You mix present (“walk”) with past (“last night”). Changing “walk” to “walked” keeps past tense throughout the narration.  \n• “You coming?” Jay says, but I was already at the claw machine… → Separate into two sentences or use a semicolon. For example: “You coming?” Jay says. I was already at the claw machine…  \n  – Issue: run-on sentence and dialogue tag punctuation. Ending the quote with a question mark should be followed by a closing quote and then a period or new sentence before continuing.  \n• “I am thinking this is silly and then the claw was moving” → “I think this is silly, and then the claw moved”  \n  – Issue: tense consistency and clarity. Changing “am thinking” to simple present (“think”) or past (“thought”) and “was moving” to “moved” aligns your verbs.  \n• “The whale slips, then it slip again” → “The whale slips, then it slips again.”  \n  – Issue: subject‐verb agreement. “It slip” should be “it slips” to match singular subject “whale.”  \n• “I drop the token. It clatters. I am thinking…” → consider merging: “I drop the token; it clatters, and I think…”  \n  – Issue: choppy sentence rhythm. Using a semicolon or conjunction binds related actions for smoother flow.\n\nStructural Suggestions  \n• Break into paragraphs for better pacing:  \n  – Paragraph 1: station arrival and mood (lines about lights buzzing, dusty air).  \n  – Paragraph 2: Jay’s dialogue and your diversion to the claw machine.  \n  – Paragraph 3: dropping the token and the machine’s action.  \n  This separation guides the reader through each beat of the scene and prevents short sentences from running together.  \n• Rearrange sensory details to “show” more: start with a small action (like flicking a coin into your palm) before describing smells. This grounds the narrator’s body in the scene, then expands to scent and sound.  \n• Introduce internal reflection after action: rather than “I am thinking this is silly” in the middle, you might pause after the claw moves to let the narrator’s thoughts unfold, then return to action. That variation pulls readers deeper into the reflective voice.\n\nOpportunities for Improvement  \n• Show vs. tell: replace “the air smells of dust and coins” with a brief image, e.g., “I can taste the powdery dust on my tongue and hear the soft jingle of loose change.”  \n• Emotional stakes: hint at why the plush whale matters—does it remind the narrator of someone or something? A sentence or two of backstory will deepen engagement.  \n• Vary sentence length: mix short, punchy lines with longer, flowing ones to reflect that whimsical tone and keep readers on their toes.\n\nFormatting Guidance  \n• Use standard manuscript format: 12-point Courier or Times New Roman, double-spaced, one-inch margins.  \n• Dialogue formatting: start a new line each time the speaker changes.  \n• Page header: include your last name/scene title and page number in the upper right.  \n• Indent first line of each paragraph by ½ inch—don’t add extra spaces between paragraphs in double-spaced prose.\n\nWould you like me to produce a fully revised version of your scene incorporating these edits? Or do you need more guidance on any specific area?",

    "coverageText": "Overview  \nThis feedback focuses on making your complaint email clear, concise, and professionally structured. Based on your goals—professional tone, firm yet polite voice, and retention of order details—we’ll address line-by-line grammar and spelling, suggest ways to tighten the structure, and provide formatting tips to ensure a courteous, actionable message under 250 words.\n\nOverall Feedback  \n• Your email conveys the core issue and order details but feels abrupt in places. Softening some phrases will maintain firmness without sounding confrontational.  \n• Breaking the body into short, focused paragraphs will improve readability and flow.  \n• A clearer subject line and a direct call to action will guide customer service to respond quickly.\n\nSpelling Edits  \n• “thats not possible” → “that’s not possible”  \n  – Issue: missing apostrophe (spelling). Adding the apostrophe corrects the contraction.  \n• No other misspellings detected.\n\nGrammar Edits  \n• Salutation: “To whom it may concern,”  \n  – Add a comma after “concern” if kept; alternatively use “Hello,” or “Dear Customer Support Team,” for a friendlier tone. (grammar: punctuation)  \n• Date format: “Aug 29.” → “August 29,”  \n  – Issue: consistency and formality (style). Spelling out the month and adding a comma matches formal email conventions.  \n• “This is pretty unacceptable, honestly.” → “This situation is unacceptable.”  \n  – Issue: tone (clarity and concision). Removing “pretty” and “honestly” makes the sentence firmer and more professional.  \n• “if thats not possible.” → “if that’s not possible.”  \n  – Issue: missing apostrophe (spelling) and avoid sentence fragments by connecting ideas smoothly.  \n\nStructural Suggestions  \n• Subject Line: Change from “Issue with damaged monitor order” to “Request for Replacement or Refund – Order #A11359”  \n  – Improves clarity and urgency, helping the team prioritize.  \n• Opening Paragraph: Start by briefly stating your purpose and including order details. For example:  \n    “I purchased a 27″ monitor (Order #A11359) on August 29. Upon arrival, I discovered a cracked screen and a dent in the right corner.”  \n  – Combines related facts for better flow.  \n• Second Paragraph: Describe your attempt to call and the problem with hold times.  \n  – Keeps each paragraph focused on a single topic.  \n• Closing Paragraph: State your request and ask for next steps.  \n  – A clear call to action guides the reader on exactly what to do.\n\nOpportunities for Improvement  \n• Tone: Replace “To whom it may concern” with a personalized greeting if you have a name.  \n• Attachments: Mention “I have attached photos” earlier so it doesn’t get overlooked.  \n• Timeline: Specify when you’d like a response (e.g., “within five business days”) to set expectations.\n\nFormatting Guidance  \n• Use an email structure:  \n   1. Subject line (clear and action-focused)  \n   2. Greeting (e.g., “Dear Customer Support Team,”)  \n   3. Body (3 short paragraphs: issue description, attempted contact, request)  \n   4. Call to action (“Please let me know the next steps.”)  \n   5. Signature (name, contact info)  \n• Keep paragraphs to 2–4 sentences for readability.  \n• Use bullet points only if you list multiple issues or requests.\n\nWould you like me to generate a fully revised version of your email incorporating these suggestions?

To make a stronger impression on internship recruiters, start each bullet with a powerful verb, keep tense consistent (present for current tasks, past for former roles), and use parallel phrasing. Quantifying achievements where possible will boost credibility.\n\nSpelling Edits  \n• No spelling errors detected. (Spelling check)  \n\nGrammar Edits  \n• “helps customers with questions and returns”  \n  – Issue: lowercase first word and weak verb.  \n  – Revision: “Assist customers with inquiries and process returns”  \n  – Rationale: Capitalizes the first word, uses a stronger verb “assist,” and applies parallel action phrasing. (Grammar, style)  \n\n• “Responsible for cash register closing”  \n  – Issue: lacks an initiating verb and is a noun phrase, not a full action statement.  \n  – Revision: “Close cash register at end of each shift”  \n  – Rationale: Begins with a clear action verb and specifies timing. (Grammar, clarity)  \n\n• “Trained two new hires on stocking”  \n  – Issue: tense is correct for a past role but could be more specific.  \n  – Revision: “Trained two new employees on stocking procedures”  \n  – Rationale: “Employees” is more formal, “procedures” adds precision. (Clarity, style)  \n\n• “improved sales by talking more about rewards card”  \n  – Issue: lowercase start, passive phrasing, vague.  \n  – Revision: “Increased sales by promoting rewards card enrollment”  \n  – Rationale: Capitalizes first word, uses a stronger verb (“increased”), and clarifies action. (Grammar, style)  \n\n• “Organized the backroom inventory (ongoing)”  \n  – Issue: past tense for an ongoing task and parentheses break flow.  \n  – Revision: “Organize backroom inventory ongoing” or better – “Organize backroom inventory continuously”  \n  – Rationale: Switches to present tense to reflect ongoing status and removes parentheses. (Tense consistency, formatting)  \n\nStructural Suggestions  \n• Order bullets by impact and relevance: place achievement-oriented items (e.g., sales growth) at or near the top to grab attention first.  \n  – Improves flow by leading with accomplishments, then day-to-day duties.  \n• Group similar activities: combine inventory and stocking responsibilities if appropriate.  \n  – Example: “Train new employees on stocking procedures and organize backroom inventory”  \n  – Enhances coherence and frees space for adding metrics.  \n\nOpportunities for Improvement  \n• Add metrics or numbers where possible (e.g., average daily customers assisted, percentage sales increase).  \n• Mention software or systems used (e.g., point-of-sale system name) to demonstrate technical skills.  \n• Include any customer satisfaction or error-reduction data to reinforce impact.  \n• Refine “ongoing” tasks by specifying frequency or scale (e.g., weekly inventory, 500 SKUs).  \n\nFormatting Guidance  \n• Use no periods at the end of bullets for consistency.  \n• Ensure each bullet starts with a capital letter and a strong verb.  \n• Keep bullets to one line if possible or break long bullets into two concise lines.  \n• Align tense: present for current role, past for former roles.  \n• Maintain uniform indentation and spacing in your resume template.  \n\nWould you like me to produce a fully rewritten version of these bullet points incorporating all the suggestions?

It wasn’t perfect, but it worked, and we kept going. This taught me how community isn’t a slogan; it’s people showing up for each other. I still worry about sounding “right,” but I’ve learned to ask questions and keep trying even when I’m unsure. College, to me, is a place to grow that force of trying into something that can help others, especially families navigating systems that pretend to be simple.",

    "coverageText": "Overview  \nBased on your goals—to strengthen the narrative arc and clarity while preserving your authentic voice in a college-application personal statement—this edit focuses on:  \n- Maintaining your sincere, reflective, confident (but humble) tone  \n- Preserving cultural and personal details without exaggeration  \n- Clarifying phrasing and tightening language for maximum impact  \n- Structuring into clear paragraphs under 650 words  \n\nOverall Feedback  \nYour essay offers a compelling snapshot of how you’ve turned real-world challenges into growth. The opening anecdote about translating bank forms immediately establishes your background and responsibility. The pandemic example shows initiative and community values. To strengthen the narrative arc, try tightening some phrases for clarity, breaking the text into distinct paragraphs (introduction, development, reflection, conclusion), and adding a brief detail or two to heighten emotional resonance. Overall, you speak directly to admissions officers with a confident yet humble voice that aligns well with your goals.\n\nSpelling Edits  \n• No spelling errors were found in the text. (Spelling: your word choices are correct and free of typos.)\n\nGrammar Edits  \n• “that force of trying” → “that force of persistence”  \n  ­­Issue type: word choice (clarity)  \n  Rationale: Using “persistence” as a noun feels more natural than “trying,” which is gerund-heavy and slightly awkward.  \n• In “I made flyers, wrote emails, and built a simple website on my cracked phone,” consider parallel verb forms: “I created flyers, drafted emails, and built a simple website on my cracked phone.”  \n  ­­Issue type: parallelism (style)  \n  Rationale: Using three verbs of similar register (“created,” “drafted,” “built”) makes the list read more smoothly.  \n• “College, to me, is a place to grow that force …” → “To me, college is where I can grow this persistence …”  \n  ­­Issue type: sentence structure (clarity)  \n  Rationale: Beginning with “To me” and referencing “this persistence” directly ties back to the revised phrase and improves flow.  \n\nStructural Suggestions  \n• Break into four paragraphs:  \n  ­­1. Introduction (lines 1–2): your first-generation background and translating forms  \n  ­­2. Development (lines 3–5): growth of responsibility, pandemic example, action steps  \n  ­­3. Reflection (line 6–7): what those experiences taught you about community and asking questions  \n  ­­4. Conclusion (line 8): your vision for college and helping others  \n  Explanation: Separating ideas into paragraphs helps admissions officers track your progression from challenge to action to insight and goal.  \n• Shift the pandemic anecdote (“When my mom’s small catering business …”) to its own paragraph and begin with a more vivid moment—e.g., “I tapped out flyers on my cracked phone in the midst of supply shortages.”  \n  Explanation: A stronger opening to that paragraph hooks the reader with sensory detail before summarizing your tasks.  \n\nOpportunities for Improvement  \n• Add a specific detail about a bank form or bill you translated (e.g., an overdraft notice or mortgage statement).  \n  Explanation: A concrete example deepens authenticity and shows rather than tells your early responsibilities.  \n• Briefly mention a skill or insight you hope to build in college (e.g., data analysis, communication workshops).  \n  Explanation: Demonstrates that you’ve researched what college can offer you and how you’ll apply it to help families.  \n• Strengthen transitions with linking phrases (e.g., “Similarly,” “As a result,” “Building on that lesson”).  \n  Explanation: Smooths movement between ideas and reinforces causality in your narrative.  \n\nFormatting Guidance  \n• Keep paragraphs short (3–5 sentences) with clear topic sentences; avoids walls of text.  \n• Omit headings—use natural breaks and transitions, per admissions essay conventions.  \n• Track word count carefully—aim for 630–650 words to leave room for small edits.  \n• Use one-inch margins, 12-point serif font (e.g., Times New Roman), and single spacing.  \n• Include no citations or bullet points—maintain an organic, storytelling flow.  \n\nWould you like further assistance refining any section, more detailed line-by-line comments, or help weaving in the specific examples mentioned? I’d be happy to generate a fully rewritten version of your essay incorporating these suggestions upon your request.",

    "coverageText": "Overview  \nBased on your goals (improving word choice, checking capitalization and punctuation, preserving line breaks and imagery), I’ve taken a close, line-by-line look at your free-verse poem. My edits focus on correcting small errors (spelling, capitalization), tightening punctuation for clarity, offering subtle style suggestions to deepen the lyrical tone, and recommending stanza breaks that respect your core images and metaphors.\n\nOverall Feedback  \nYour poem offers vivid, contemplative images—the sun as a setting force, the chase of a waning day, secret-keeping gravel, silent witnesses in the trees, and tomorrow as an unfolded map. To strengthen the lyrical flow for a school literary journal, I recommend consistent capitalization at the start of lines, a single spelling correction, and punctuation tweaks that help guide the reader through each image without imposing rhyme. Small word-choice shifts will sharpen clarity while preserving your metaphors.\n\nSpelling Edits  \n• “dropps” → “drops”  \n  Issue type: spelling  \n  Rationale: “Dropps” is a misspelling. Correcting to “drops” ensures standard spelling and keeps the reader focused on the imagery.  \n\nGrammar Edits  \n• Line 1, “the sun dropps behind the hill—” → “The sun drops behind the hill—”  \n  Issue type: capitalization, spelling  \n  Rationale: Capitalize the first word of a line in English poetry for consistency with conventions; correct “dropps” to “drops.”  \n• Line 2, “i chase the day like a late bus,” → “I chase the day like a late bus,”  \n  Issue type: capitalization  \n  Rationale: Capitalize “I” to follow standard English usage and maintain a polished look in your journal submission.  \n• Line 4, “I call the trees my witnesses” → consider “I call the trees my witnesses,” (add comma)  \n  Issue type: punctuation  \n  Rationale: A trailing comma can create a pause that echoes the breath before “and they don’t answer…” making the rhythm more lyrical.  \n\nStructural Suggestions  \n• Group lines 1–2 as Stanza 1 (sun & chase): establishes your opening image and action together, so the reader enters the poem with a clear scene and movement.  \n• Group lines 3–4 as Stanza 2 (secrets & witnesses): ties the personal secret to the trees, creating a natural pause before the parenthetical aside.  \n• Lines 5–6 as Stanza 3 (leaves applauding): keeps the parenthesis and the applause image tightly connected, emphasizing their quiet energy.  \n• Lines 7–8 as Stanza 4 (tomorrow’s map): isolates the final metaphor for emphasis, so the reader lingers on “that I forgot to unfold.”  \n\nOpportunities for Improvement  \n• Word choice: consider swapping “keeps my secrets” for something more active—e.g., “harbors my secrets”—to heighten the sense that the gravel is almost alive.  \n• Rhythm and line length: shortening or lengthening a line can emphasize key words (for instance, breaking “shoes unlaced” onto its own line for extra space).  \n• Sensory detail: you might add a subtle sound or color detail (a whisper of wind, the orange glow on the gravel) to deepen the contemplative tone.  \n• Transition words: in Stanza 2 or 3, a gentle connector (like “yet” or “still”) could underline the contrast between silence and the leaves’ applause.  \n\nFormatting Guidance  \n• Stanza breaks: use a blank line between each suggested grouping to guide readers through shifts in image or mood.  \n• Capitalization: capitalize each line’s first word for a consistent, polished look in a school journal.  \n• Em-dashes: retain your em-dash after “hill” but ensure it’s a proper long dash (—) rather than two hyphens.  \n• Parentheses vs. dashes: consider replacing the parentheses around “they never did” with em-dashes for stronger emphasis—e.g., and they don’t answer—they never did—but that remains a stylistic choice.  \n• Line breaks: preserve your intentional breaks, but feel free to indent the second line of a broken sentence (like lines 7–8) slightly for visual unity.\n\nWould you like me to produce a fully revised version of your poem incorporating these edits? Or is there another aspect you’d like to explore further?",

We’ll ensure you meet MLA requirements for book titles and quotes, keep spoilers to the midpoint, and maintain an analytical yet accessible style for classmates and your teacher.\n\nOverall Feedback  \n• Thesis clarity: Your review needs a clear evaluative statement up front—what aspect of The Giver you’re judging (symbolism, pacing, ending, etc.) and why those criteria matter.  \n• Tone and voice: Shift from casual phrasing (“I liked…”) toward analytical observations supported by evidence. Keep your personal response but frame it in an academic register.  \n• Line-by-line polish: Several sentences need subject-verb fixes, punctuation around introductory clauses, and smoother transitions.  \n• Structure: Organize into four distinct sections—intro with thesis, concise summary (no major spoilers), analysis paragraphs on symbolism, pacing, ending, and a closing recommendation that ties back to your thesis.\n\nSpelling Edits  \n• “its” in “its not.”  \n  – Corrected to “it’s” (contraction of “it is”).  \n  – Issue: punctuation/grammar—apostrophe needed.\n\nGrammar Edits  \n• Original: In The Giver by Lois Lowry, the community seems perfect but actually its not.  \n  – Revision: In The Giver by Lois Lowry, the community seems perfect, but it’s not.  \n  – Issue: missing comma before “but”; needs “it’s” (contraction) for “it is.”  \n• Original: I liked the way the author use color as a symbol of freedom and choice.  \n  – Revision: I liked the way the author uses color as a symbol of freedom and choice.  \n  – Issue: subject–verb agreement (“author uses”).  \n• Original: When Jonas first sees the apple “change,” it foreshadows him seeing the world differently.  \n  – Revision: When Jonas first sees the apple “change,” it foreshadows his altered view of the world.  \n  – Issue: pronoun (“him” → “his”) and clarity.  \n• Original: The pacing in the middle got slow for me and I think the ending was confusing but good.  \n  – Revision: The pacing in the middle slowed down, and although the ending was initially confusing, it ultimately proved effective.  \n  – Issue: tense consistency, comma splice, and tone—replace “got slow for me” with a more formal structure.  \n• Original: Overall I would recommend this book because it makes you think about choices and memory and what is price of safety.  \n  – Revision: Overall, I would recommend this book because it prompts readers to consider the connections between choice, memory, and the price of safety.  \n  – Issue: missing comma after “Overall,” run-on ideas, awkward word order (“what the price of safety is”).\n\nStructural Suggestions  \n• Intro paragraph:  \n  – Add a strong thesis sentence that names your evaluation criteria (symbolism, pacing, ending clarity) and your overall judgment.  \n  – Explain briefly why these criteria matter to you as a reader.  \n• Summary section:  \n  – Insert a concise, spoiler-light summary of the plot up to mid-point. One paragraph only.  \n  – Avoid revealing events beyond the community’s revelations or Jonas’s first training experiences.  \n• Analysis section:  \n  – Organize three short paragraphs, each with a clear topic sentence:  \n    1. Symbolism of color (quote the apple scene; MLA-cite page).  \n    2. Pacing in the middle chapters (give an example of a quieter scene).  \n    3. Ending’s clarity (describe what felt confusing and why it still worked).  \n  – This improves flow by grouping related ideas.  \n• Conclusion paragraph:  \n  – Restate your refined thesis and tie it back to why classmates should read it.  \n  – Offer a final evaluative statement on the book’s impact.\n\nOpportunities for Improvement  \n• Transitions: Use linking words (Furthermore, However, In addition) to guide the reader between ideas.  \n• Evidence and examples: Integrate at least one direct quote from the text, followed by brief analysis—this strengthens your argument.  \n• Balance summary and analysis: Keep the summary short so you have space to analyze key points in depth.  \n• Tone: Swap informal phrases (“got slow for me,” “but good”) for more precise academic language (“slowed,” “effective”).\n\nFormatting Guidance  \n• MLA book title formatting: Italicize The Giver.  \n• Quote formatting: Use quotation marks around any text from the novel, and include an in-text citation—e.g., (Lowry 45).  \n• Document style: Double-space your review in 12pt Times New Roman with 1\" margins.  \n• Paragraphing: Indent the first line of each paragraph one half-inch.  \n• Heading (optional): At top left, include your name, teacher’s name, course, and date, double-spaced, then center the title.\n\nWould you like me to generate a fully revised version of your review that incorporates these suggestions?

Splitting the sentence improves focus.  \n• “We test filtration rates and particle counts with a DIY microscope rig.”  \n  – Suggested: “Filtration rates and particle counts were measured using a do-it-yourself (DIY) microscope rig.”  \n  – Issue: tense consistency (past tense), first-person removal, acronym definition.  \n• “Results shows a 42% mean reduction…”  \n  – Suggested: “Results show a 42% mean reduction…”  \n  – Issue: subject-verb agreement (plural “Results” needs “show”), tense consistency.  \n• “18% reduction in 50–100 μm.”  \n  – Suggested: “an 18% reduction in particles sized 50–100 micrometers (µm).”  \n  – Issue: clarity (state what is reduced), unit definition, avoid dangling phrase.\n\nStructural Suggestions  \n• Background: Start with “Plastic waste in waterways is increasing.” This orients the reader immediately.  \n• Methods: Combine design and testing description: “A low-cost microplastic filter using natural fibers was designed and tested on local creek samples. Filtration rates and particle counts were measured using a do-it-yourself (DIY) microscope rig.”  \n  – Improves flow by grouping all procedural information.  \n• Results: Present percentage reductions in one sentence: “Results show a 42% mean reduction in particles larger than 100 micrometers (µm) after 30 minutes and an 18% reduction in particles sized 50–100 µm.”  \n  – Consolidates findings for readability.  \n• Conclusion: End with limitations and future potential: “Limitations include inconsistent flow and clogging; however, the design can be scaled for classroom use.”  \n  – Clearly signals the end of the abstract and its implications.\n\nOpportunities for Improvement  \n• Add context on sample size or number of trials to strengthen credibility.  \n• Indicate measurement uncertainty or standard deviation if available.  \n• Include a brief statement on the filter’s material properties or cost to highlight “low-cost.”  \n• Use transition words (e.g., “however,” “therefore”) to link sentences smoothly.  \n\nFormatting Guidance  \n• Keep the entire abstract under 250 words; aim for a single paragraph divided logically by clauses or semicolons.  \n• Avoid headers in the submitted abstract unless required; use clear signposting phrases (Background, Methods, etc.).  \n• Define all acronyms on first use (e.g., do-it-yourself (DIY), micrometer (µm)).  \n• Use SI units and Greek letters correctly (µm for micrometers).  \n• Ensure consistent punctuation around percentages and units (e.g., “42 %,” “100 µm”).\n\nWould you like me to generate a rewritten version of your abstract incorporating these suggestions? Do you need any additional guidance or further revisions?",

    "coverageText": "Overview  \nBased on your goals—polishing tone and clarity, ensuring coherence, and trimming filler while keeping your authentic voice—this feedback will sharpen your scholarship essay’s narrative flow and tighten language for a selection committee. I focus on making each sentence purposeful, maintaining a hopeful, sincere tone, and respecting your 500-word limit in plain-text paragraphs of 4–6 sentences.\n\nOverall Feedback  \n• Your introduction shows resilience and responsibility, which is exactly what scholarship committees want to see.  \n• Some sentences can be tightened or reordered to improve flow and reduce filler.  \n• Strengthen the connection between your personal story and how the scholarship will directly impact your academic progress.  \n• Maintain your authentic voice—brief, sincere, and forward-looking—while ensuring each detail contributes to your main message.\n\nSpelling Edits  \n• No spelling errors detected. (Spelling – your word choices are all correct.)\n\nGrammar Edits  \n• “busy is how I stayed steady” → Consider “being busy helped me stay steady” (Parallel structure – “being busy” pairs two gerunds for clarity).  \n• “Once, I missed a shift to take him to an appointment and got written up,” → Add a comma: “Once, I missed a shift to take him to an appointment, and I got written up,” (Comma usage – separate two independent clauses).  \n• “I’m not perfect and I still overcommit, but I’ve learned to ask for help and to say no.” → Add comma before “and”: “I’m not perfect, and I still overcommit, but I’ve learned to ask for help and say no.” (Comma usage – clarity in compound sentence; parallel verbs “ask” and “say”).  \n• “choose time for classes” → Consider “free up time for my classes” (Verb choice – “free up” more clearly conveys making space in your schedule).\n\nStructural Suggestions  \n• Lead with context: Move “when things were uncertain at home” earlier. For example, “When things were uncertain at home, being busy helped me stay steady.” This sets the scene before introducing outside opinions.  \n• Combine related ideas: Merge the first two sentences into one concise opener. It tightens pacing and removes filler.  \n• End with impact: After explaining how the scholarship helps you, briefly state a goal (e.g., “This support will allow me to focus on coursework and ultimately pursue [your long-term goal]”). It reinforces purpose and leaves a lasting impression.  \n• Ensure each sentence answers “Why does this matter to the committee?” or “How does this advance my story?”\n\nOpportunities for Improvement  \n• Add a concrete example of balancing tasks (e.g., hours per week, specific subject you excelled in despite time constraints) to illustrate your work ethic.  \n• Include a short reflection on what you’ve learned about leadership or time management. That insight shows personal growth.  \n• Use transitional words (“As a result,” “Because of this,”) sparingly to guide readers through your narrative without sounding formal.  \n• Ensure your closing paragraph ties back to the opening and underscores your hopefulness and sincerity.\n\nFormatting Guidance  \n• Keep this as a single paragraph of 4–6 sentences, since scholarship essays often favor concise, impactful blocks.  \n• Plain text only: no headings or bullet lists in the final submission.  \n• Watch your total word count—aim for ~480–490 words to leave room for last-minute edits.  \n• Standard font (e.g., Times New Roman or Arial 11–12 pt), 1-inch margins, double-spaced (if the committee has formatting guidelines).\n\nWould you like me to produce a revised version of your paragraph incorporating these changes?

    "coverageText": "Overview  \nBased on your goals—to standardize the narrative in American English, address code-switching, and fix grammar/tense—this edit focuses on keeping your cultural references while converting Spanish phrases into clear, idiomatic English. We’ll preserve your personal voice and conversational tone for your high-school teacher audience.\n\nOverall Feedback  \nYour paragraph clearly conveys the challenge and growth in switching between Spanish and English. You have a strong narrative voice and honest reflections, but a few expressions still reflect Spanish structure and there are minor grammar choices that can interrupt flow. Cleaning up these moments will make your experience even more relatable and easy to follow.\n\nSpelling Edits  \n- No spelling errors found. Your words are all correctly spelled. (Issue: spelling – no action needed.)\n\nGrammar Edits  \n- “Mi familia and I moved to the U.S. when I was 10” → “My family and I moved to the U.S. when I was ten.”  \n  • Issue: style/consistency. Rationale: Switching “Mi familia” to “My family” keeps it in standard American English. Spelling out “ten” aligns with conventional age notation in narratives.  \n- “at la escuela office” → “at the school office.”  \n  • Issue: dialect and clarity. Rationale: Translating “la escuela” to “the school” uses standard terms and removes code-switching mid-sentence.  \n- “Sometimes I say things like ‘I have 15 years’ because that’s how we say it in Spanish,” → “Sometimes I say things like ‘I’m 15 years old’ because in Spanish we literally say ‘I have 15 years,’”  \n  • Issue: grammar and clarity. Rationale: “I’m 15 years old” is the correct English equivalent. Placing the Spanish phrase in quotation clarifies its origin.  \n- “It be confusing switching back and forth,” → “It can be confusing to switch back and forth,”  \n  • Issue: tense/formality. Rationale: “It can be confusing” uses a standard modal construction instead of nonstandard “be.”  \n- “but I’m learning to slow down and think in English first when needed, and also not be ashamed of speaking both.” → “but I’m learning to slow down, think in English first when I need to, and not be ashamed of speaking both languages.”  \n  • Issue: parallel structure. Rationale: Adding “languages” clarifies “both,” and ensuring each verb phrase follows the same pattern improves readability.\n\nStructural Suggestions  \n- Split the first sentence for clarity. Consider:  \n  1) “When I was ten, my family and I moved to the U.S.”  \n  2) “At the school office, I used to translate for my parents.”  \n  • Improves flow by separating background (move) from your translating role.  \n- Move the explanation of “I have 15 years” immediately after mentioning code-switching:  \n  • This groups all examples of language mixing into one spot, making your narrative progression smoother.  \n- Consider adding a brief concluding sentence on how these experiences shape you today, e.g.: “That practice not only helped my parents but also made me more confident in both languages.”  \n  • Provides a stronger wrap-up and reinforces your growth.\n\nOpportunities for Improvement  \n- Add specific feelings or reactions (e.g., “I felt embarrassed when people laughed” or “I laughed along”) to deepen emotional engagement.  \n- Include a transition word (however, although, even though) before “but I’m learning…” to strengthen connection between confusion and personal growth.  \n- If space allows, give one concrete example of translating at school to illustrate your role and its impact.\n\nFormatting Guidance  \n- Keep all Spanish terms (if you choose to retain any) in italics: e.g., *la escuela*.  \n- Use standard paragraphing without extra line breaks for a personal-narrative paragraph.  \n- Use straight quotation marks around spoken phrases: “I’m 15 years old.”  \n- Maintain one-inch margins and a readable font (e.g., Times New Roman, 12 pt) for submission to a teacher.\n\nWould you like me to generate a revised version of your paragraph incorporating these suggestions?

Finally, you’ll get clear formatting guidance for your speaking notes, including cue words and spacing.\n\nOverall Feedback  \n• You have a strong, relatable hook and a clear problem–solution structure.  \n• The evidence section needs more concrete details and smoother transitions to keep your classmates engaged.  \n• Addressing the counterargument is effective but could use a transition phrase and brief explanation to strengthen your point.  \n• Your three-step solution is concise, but you can expand each step slightly to meet the time requirement and make it actionable.  \n• Close with a powerful call to action—spell out exactly what you want your peers to do over the next seven days.\n\nSpelling Edits  \n• No spelling errors found. (Spelling check) Your outline’s key words are all spelled correctly.\n\nGrammar Edits  \n• “Screen time going up; attention going down.”  \n  – Corrected: “Screen time is increasing, and attention spans are decreasing.”  \n  – Issue: grammar (subject–verb agreement) and clarity. Adding verbs makes it a complete sentence and keeps the parallel structure.  \n• “grades slipping, sleep shorter, I felt it last semester.”  \n  – Corrected: “Grades are slipping, sleep is shorter, and I felt these effects last semester.”  \n  – Issue: parallel structure and clarity. Use full verbs and consistent phrasing for each item.  \n• “Phones are tools—yes, but tools shape us.”  \n  – Corrected: “Phones are tools, yes, but these tools shape us.”  \n  – Issue: punctuation. A comma after “tools” softens the break and improves flow.  \n• “Ask audience to try it for 7 days.”  \n  – Corrected: “Ask the audience to try these steps for seven days.”  \n  – Issue: clarity and style. Spell out “seven” (style) and specify “these steps” so the call to action is clear.\n\nStructural Suggestions  \n• Hook → Problem/Evidence: After your hook, add a one-sentence transition like, “Here’s why that matters to all of us.” This will guide listeners into the problem.  \n• Combine “Problem” and “Evidence”: Rather than separate bullets, narrate: “Over the last year, my average screen time shot up by two hours a day, my grades dipped from a B+ to a B–, and I was waking up exhausted.” This merges evidence and personal anecdote for impact.  \n• Counterargument placement: Introduce it with “Now, you might be thinking…” This sets up the objection before you refute it.  \n• Solution expansion: Label each step (“Step 1: Switch to grayscale,” etc.), then add a brief “why this works” sentence under each. That helps fill time and gives classmates context.  \n• Close with call to action: End with a clear challenge—“Will you join me in regaining control of your attention? Let’s start today, for the next seven days.” This frames the ask as a group effort.\n\nOpportunities for Improvement  \n• Add a brief data point or statistic (e.g., average teen screen time) to strengthen your evidence.  \n• Use a short personal story or visual image to make the problem relatable.  \n• Include a rhetorical question or quick audience poll (“How many of you check Instagram first thing?”) for engagement.  \n• Vary sentence length and tone—mix shorter, punchy lines with longer, explanatory ones to maintain interest.\n\nFormatting Guidance  \n• Headings: Label each main section in your notes—HOOK, PROBLEM, EVIDENCE, COUNTERARGUMENT, SOLUTION, CALL TO ACTION.  \n• Cue words: Insert [PAUSE] after your hook, [EMPHASIZE] before a key fact, [LOOK AROUND] when engaging classmates.  \n• Spacing: Leave one line blank between sections so you can turn pages without losing your place.  \n• Indentation: Use bullet points for sub-ideas under each heading, and number your three steps clearly.  \n• Timing notes: In the margin, jot time targets (e.g., “1 min for Hook,” “2 min for Evidence”) to stay within 5–6 minutes.\n\nWould you like me to generate a rewritten version of your speech outline incorporating all these suggestions?

Past tense “learned” matches the timeline.  \n• “By spring I was jogging, then I am running.”  \n  – Suggestion: Change “then I am running” to “then I was running.”  \n  – Issue: tense consistency (grammar). Unifying past tense preserves the retrospective narrative.  \n• “The day I broke my ankle is the day I decided to join track, which doesn’t make sense until I explain.”  \n  – Suggestion: Change “doesn’t” to “didn’t,” or consider rephrasing to “may not make sense yet.”  \n  – Issue: tense consistency (grammar) and tone (clarity). “Didn’t” matches past tense; “yet” softens the transition.  \n\nStructural Suggestions  \n• Open with the fall, then explain the decision:  \n  – Move “The day I broke my ankle…” after your vivid description of slipping on ice. This anchors the reader in the moment before revealing your decision to join track.  \n• Group the rehabilitation details into one paragraph:  \n  – Combine “Later, in physical therapy…” with a few extra descriptive sentences about your exercises or feelings. This makes the therapy phase feel more cohesive.  \n• Conclude with a reflective summary:  \n  – After “Joining track taught me…,” add a brief reflection sentence that ties back to hope or future goals. This bookends your narrative with the reflective, hopeful tone you want.  \n\nOpportunities for Improvement  \n• Add sensory details: Describe the sharp sting of cold air in your lungs as you fell or the squeak of sneakers on the track.  \n• Vary sentence length: Mix one- or two-word exclamations (“Ouch!”) or questions (“Could I do this?”) with longer, flowing sentences for emphasis.  \n• Strengthen transitions: Use words like “after,” “soon,” or “as a result” to show cause and effect between injury, therapy, and joining track.  \n\nFormatting Guidance  \n• Paragraphs:  \n  – Paragraph 1: The fall and decision to join track.  \n  – Paragraph 2: Physical therapy experience.  \n  – Paragraph 3: Returning to running and lesson learned.  \n• Standard essay style:  \n  – Double-space your text, use 12-point Times New Roman, and indent the first line of each paragraph.  \n  – No subheadings—let the flow of your narrative guide the reader.  \n\nWould you like me to generate a fully rewritten version of your narrative that incorporates these edits? Let me know if you’d like further assistance, more examples, or any additional changes!",

    "coverageText": "Overview  \nBased on your goals—making the email polite and clear, fixing grammar and formatting, and suggesting a strong professional structure—I’ve focused on clarity, formality, and concise phrasing appropriate for a college-level email to a professor. Key areas include hyphenation, date and time formatting, paragraph division, and a more specific subject line.\n\nOverall Feedback  \nYour draft is concise and respectful, which fits your tone preference. To increase clarity and formality, I recommend:\n• Hyphenating compound modifiers and spelling out months in full.  \n• Splitting the body into two short paragraphs (context then request) for better flow.  \n• Adding a brief opening line (e.g., “I hope you are well”) to soften the request.  \n• Refining the subject line to state the exact request (“48-Hour Extension”).  \n\nSpelling Edits  \n• None detected – all words are spelled correctly.\n\nGrammar Edits  \n• Original: “I am requesting a 48 hour extension for the research brief due Sept 28.”  \n  Correction: “I am requesting a 48-hour extension for the research brief due September 28.”  \n  Reasoning: Hyphenate the compound adjective “48-hour” (grammar) and spell out the month for formality (style).\n\n• Original: “If approved, I will submit by Sept 30 at 11:59pm.”  \n  Correction: “If approved, I will submit it by September 30 at 11:59 p.m.”  \n  Reasoning: Add the pronoun “it” for clarity (grammar), spell out the month (style), and format time with periods and a space before “p.m.” (style/consistency).\n\nStructural Suggestions  \n• Add a brief opener: Insert “I hope you are well.” before stating your request. This enhances tone and rapport.  \n• Divide the body into two paragraphs:  \n  – Paragraph 1: Context (“I have completed most of the reading, but I need extra time…”)  \n  – Paragraph 2: Request and deadline (“Would you please grant me…” + specify new date/time).  \n  This separation improves readability and highlights the request.  \n• Refine the subject line: Change it to “Request for 48-Hour Extension on Research Brief Due September 28.” A precise subject helps your professor immediately know what you need.\n\nOpportunities for Improvement  \n• Consider adding a one-sentence expression of gratitude in advance (“I appreciate your understanding and support.”) to strengthen politeness.  \n• Use “would you please” instead of “I am requesting” to soften the tone.  \n• Confirm receipt: you might add, “Please let me know if this is acceptable.” to invite a reply.\n\nFormatting Guidance  \n• Subject Line: Make it action-oriented and specific (see Structural Suggestions).  \n• Greeting: “Dear Professor Ahmed,” is slightly more formal than “Hi Professor Ahmed,” but either is acceptable.  \n• Opening Line: A brief pleasantry (“I hope you’re doing well.”).  \n• Paragraphing: Two short paragraphs as outlined above.  \n• Closing: Use “Thank you for your time and consideration.”  \n• Sign-off: “Sincerely,” or “Best regards,” followed by your full name on the next line.  \n• Spacing: Single-space within paragraphs, double-space between paragraphs and around signature.\n\nWould you like me to generate a fully revised version of your email with these changes? Or is there any other aspect you’d like to adjust?",

    "coverageText": "Overview  \nBased on your goal of verifying British English spelling and punctuation and tidying minor grammar issues in a short, reflective paragraph for a UK teacher, I’ve worked line-by-line to ensure consistency with UK conventions (–ise endings, single quotes acceptable), preserved your calm, reflective tone, and added formatting tips at the end.\n\nOverall Feedback  \n• Your paragraph is clear, concise and maintains a reflective tone suited to a teacher audience.  \n• You use the correct UK spellings (‘organise’, ‘programme’, ‘colour-coded’), so no US–UK inconsistencies are present.  \n• Punctuation and tense choices are generally strong; the narrative flows from past reflection to future intent.  \n• To deepen the reflection, you might add a brief example or connect the habit to a goal for next term.  \n\nSpelling Edits  \n• No spelling errors detected. All words use correct British English conventions (e.g., ‘realised’, ‘programme’, ‘organise’, ‘colour-coded’).  \n\nGrammar Edits  \n• No grammatical issues requiring correction. The sentence structures and tense shifts (past reflection → conditional future) are appropriate and clear.  \n\nStructural Suggestions  \n• Consider adding a brief lead-in to set context, for example:  \n  – “Looking back on my revision sessions, I realised that…”  \n  This frames your reflection and strengthens coherence.  \n• To close more decisively, you might combine the last two sentences:  \n  – “The colour-coded cards made revision feel possible again, and if I can keep this habit I’ll be more consistent next term.”  \n  This reduces fragmentation and heightens flow.  \n\nOpportunities for Improvement  \n• Expand with a concrete example: mention one topic or card set that particularly helped you. This adds evidence and personal detail.  \n• Introduce a linking phrase (e.g., “Moreover,” or “In particular,”) before the middle sentence to improve transitions.  \n• Reflect briefly on why consistency matters—this deepens the reflective tone.  \n\nFormatting Guidance  \n• Use single paragraph format for short reflections, but ensure a blank line before and after in your document.  \n• Maintain single spaces after full stops (UK style).  \n• If you quote your own thoughts, use single quotes: e.g., ‘Revision felt less daunting.’  \n• For headings or titles, use Title Case without full stops.  \n\nWould you like me to produce a fully revised version of your paragraph incorporating these suggestions, or do you need additional changes or guidance?",

I recommend making the thesis explicit in the introduction, breaking the content into at least two paragraphs (one on convenience vs comfort, one on annotation habits), and adding clear transitions.

Convenience vs. comfort (device portability, eye strain, battery life)  \n  2. Annotation habits (digital highlighting vs. paper‐based note-taking)  \n  • Benefit: Organizes points either by block (all ebook points then all print points) or by point-by-point (address portability for both, then annotation for both).  \n- End with a brief conclusion paragraph that restates the thesis and reflects on when each format is best.  \n  • Benefit: Gives closure and leaves the reader with a clear takeaway.  \n\nOpportunities for Improvement  \n- Make the thesis more analytical by stating why the comparison matters (for example, “Understanding these differences helps readers choose the best format for study or leisure.”).  \n- Add brief examples or scenarios (e.g., “For students pulling an all-nighter, digital search functions can save time…”).  \n- Use transitional words (however, conversely, similarly) to highlight contrasts and similarities.  \n\nFormatting Guidance  \n- Use 12-point Times New Roman, double-spaced, with 1-inch margins.  \n- Include an MLA header on the first page (your name, instructor name, course, date).  \n- Center your essay title between the header and your text.  \n- Indent each new paragraph ½ inch.  \n- Use parenthetical citations only if you quote or paraphrase sources (not needed here).  \n\nWould you like me to produce a fully rewritten version of your excerpt incorporating these edits?

    "coverageText": "Overview  \nBased on your goals (improving clarity and specificity, fixing articles and verb forms, and suggesting a stronger conclusion) and your audience (class blog readers), I’ve focused on tightening your analysis, correcting small grammatical issues, and reshaping your ending so it makes a stronger thematic point—all while preserving the chosen opening storm scene and avoiding spoilers beyond the first 30 minutes.\n\nOverall Feedback  \nYour paragraph effectively highlights how the storm scene establishes tension and foreshadows the film’s survival theme. To sharpen it for a blog audience, I recommend:  \n- Naming or specifying “the commander” for clarity  \n- Maintaining present-tense consistency throughout  \n- Varying sentence structure to improve flow  \n- Ending with a stronger concluding sentence that ties back to your main point  \n\nSpelling Edits  \n• No spelling errors detected. Your word choice is clear, and all terms are spelled correctly.\n\nGrammar Edits  \n• “Commander makes fast call” → “The commander makes a quick decision.”  \n  ­­Issue: article usage and style. Explanation: Adding “The” clarifies who you mean, and “quick decision” reads more naturally than “fast call.”  \n• “it put us in chaos” → “it puts the audience in chaos.”  \n  Issue: verb tense consistency and pronoun clarity. Explanation: “Puts” keeps present tense, and “the audience” is more formal than “us.”  \n• “The sound mix is loud and harsh, it put us in chaos.” → two sentences or semicolon:  \n   “The sound mix is loud and harsh; it puts the audience in chaos.”  \n  Issue: comma splice. Explanation: A semicolon or period correctly separates two independent clauses.  \n• “group decision under pressure” → “group decision-making under pressure”  \n  Issue: style and clarity. Explanation: The hyphenated phrase “decision-making” more precisely names the process.\n\nStructural Suggestions  \n• Combine context and analysis for smoother flow. For example, merge your first two sentences:  \n  Original: “In the opening of *The Martian*, the storm scene shows how group decision under pressure can go wrong. Commander makes fast call and it seems rational…”  \n  Suggested: “In the opening of *The Martian*, a dust storm forces the crew’s commander to order an emergency evacuation—an ostensibly rational call that, through tight framing on worried faces, reveals the flaws of group decision-making under pressure.”  \n  How it helps: Condenses setup and analysis into one dynamic sentence, making your writing more concise.  \n• Expand briefly on the camera work. You mention “the camera shows doubt on faces”; consider noting specific shots (e.g., close-ups, shaky handheld) to strengthen your evidence.  \n• Place your thematic insight at the end, but add a more definitive conclusion:  \n  “This early sequence not only immerses viewers in chaos but also foreshadows the core struggle of *The Martian*: balancing split-second judgments with meticulous planning for survival.”  \n  How it helps: Provides a clear, thematic wrap-up that reinforces why the scene matters.\n\nOpportunities for Improvement  \n• Identify the commander by name (Commander Lewis) to ground readers in characters.  \n• Describe camera techniques (e.g., quick cuts, tight close-ups) to support your claim about tension.  \n• Add a brief transition (“Moreover,” “In doing so,” etc.) when you move from the sound mix to thematic setup for better flow.  \n• Consider a one-sentence tie-back to how this scene connects to Mark Watney’s later challenges, without spoiling plot points.\n\nFormatting Guidance  \n• Italicize film titles: *The Martian*.  \n• Keep analysis in present tense—standard for film critique.  \n• Break into two short paragraphs: one describing the scene and one drawing out the thematic significance.  \n• On a web post, use headings or subheads if you expand the section (e.g., “Setting the Stage,” “Foreshadowing Survival”).\n\nWould you like me to generate a revised version of your paragraph incorporating these suggestions?
