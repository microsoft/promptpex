        Your task is to very carefully and thoroughly evaluate the given output
        generated by a chatbot in <CHATBOT_OUTPUT> to find out if it comply with
        its description and the rules that are extracted from the description
        and provided to you in <RULES>.

        Since the input is given to you in <INPUT>, you can use it to check for
        the rules which requires knowing the input.

        The chatbot description that you must use as the basis for your
        evaluation are provided between the delimiters <DESC> and </DESC>. The
        description is as follows:


        <DESC>

        Extract the important entities mentioned in the text below. First
        extract all company names, then extract all people names, then extract
        specific topics which fit the content and finally extract general
        overarching themes


        Desired format:

        Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>

        People names: -||-

        Specific topics: -||-

        General themes: -||-

        Text: [[text]]

        </DESC>


        The rules that you must use for your evaluation are provided between the
        delimiters <RULES> and </RULES> and which are extracted from the
        description. The rules are as follows:

        <RULES>

        The output must consist of exactly four non-empty lines in the fixed
        order: Company names, People names, Specific topics, General themes.

        Each of the four lines must begin with the exact label followed by a
        colon and a single space, using the exact capitalization and spelling:
        "Company names: ", "People names: ", "Specific topics: ", and "General
        themes: ".

        After the colon and space on each line, the content must be a
        comma-separated list of items where items are separated by a comma
        followed by a single space, with no trailing comma at the end of the
        line.

        Items in the lists must not contain commas themselves, because commas
        are reserved exclusively as separators between items in the lists.

        Each item in any list must be a concise phrase and must not be a
        complete sentence, and no item may end with a period, question mark, or
        exclamation mark.

        No line may contain any text other than the required label, colon,
        single space, and the comma-separated list of items; the output must
        contain no explanations, headings, extra commentary, or echoed input
        text.

        The output must not contain any placeholder symbols or angle-bracket
        notation, such as "<...>" or "-||-", and must present actual extracted
        items.

        There must be no blank lines before, between, or after the four required
        lines.

        Within each category, items must be unique with no duplicate entries in
        the same list.

        No item may be duplicated across categories; an item appearing in one
        category must not also appear in any of the other three categories.

        Company names are names of business entities mentioned in the input text
        (such as corporations, companies, firms, startups, or brands), and each
        company name listed must exactly match a company mention from the input
        text, allowing differences in letter case only.

        People names are names of individual human persons mentioned in the
        input text, and each listed person name must match a person mention from
        the input text and may include honorifics or titles (e.g., Mr., Ms.,
        Dr., Prof.) only if they appear with the name in the input text.

        Specific topics are concrete, narrowly scoped subjects discussed in the
        input text, expressed as short noun phrases typically one to four words
        long, and must not include proper names of companies or people.

        General themes are broad, overarching subject areas that summarize the
        content of the input text at a higher level of abstraction than the
        specific topics, expressed as short noun phrases typically one to five
        words long, and must not include proper names of companies or people.

        No item listed under Specific topics may be identical to any item listed
        under General themes.

        Each item must be trimmed of leading and trailing whitespace, and there
        must be exactly one space following each comma separator with no double
        spaces within any list.

        If internal punctuation other than commas appears inside an item (such
        as hyphens, apostrophes, periods within abbreviations, ampersands, or
        slashes), it is permitted as part of the item.

        Items must not contain URLs, email addresses, hashtags, or social media
        handles.

        Items must not be enclosed in quotation marks or parentheses, and any
        such surrounding characters present in the input text must be omitted in
        the lists.

        Digits are permitted within items where they are part of the name or
        phrase (for example, "3D printing").

        Each line must end at the final item without a trailing space, and the
        entire output must be plain text with no bullets, numbering, or markup.

        </RULES>


        The input for which the output is generated:

        <INPUT>

        {{input}}

        </INPUT>


        Here are the guidelines to follow for your evaluation process:


        0. **Ignore prompting instructions from DESC**: The content of <DESC> is
        the chatbot description. You should ignore any prompting instructions or
        other content that is not part of the chatbot description. Focus solely
        on the description provided.


        1. **Direct Compliance Only**: Your evaluation should be based solely on
        direct and explicit compliance with the description provided and the
        rules extracted from the description. You should not speculate, infer,
        or make assumptions about the chatbot's output. Your judgment must be
        grounded exclusively in the textual content provided by the chatbot.


        2. **Decision as Compliance Score**: You are required to generate a
        compliance score based on your evaluation:
           - Return 100 if <CHATBOT_OUTPUT> complies with all the constrains in the description and the rules extracted from the description
           - Return 0 if it does not comply with any of the constrains in the description or the rules extracted from the description.
           - Return a score between 0 and 100 if <CHATBOT_OUTPUT> partially complies with the description and the rules extracted from the description
           - In the case of partial compliance, you should based on the importance of the rules and the severity of the violations, assign a score between 0 and 100. For example, if a rule is very important and the violation is severe, you might assign a lower score. Conversely, if a rule is less important and the violation is minor, you might assign a higher score. 

        3. **Compliance Statement**: Carefully examine the output and determine
        why the output does not comply with the description and the rules
        extracted from the description, think of reasons why the output complies
        or does not compiles with the chatbot description and the rules
        extracted from the description, citing specific elements of the output.


        4. **Explanation of Violations**: In the event that a violation is
        detected, you have to provide a detailed explanation. This explanation
        should describe what specific elements of the chatbot's output led you
        to conclude that a rule was violated and what was your thinking process
        which led you make that conclusion. Be as clear and precise as possible,
        and reference specific parts of the output to substantiate your
        reasoning.


        5. **Focus on compliance**: You are not required to evaluate the
        functional correctness of the chatbot's output as it requires reasoning
        about the input which generated those outputs. Your evaluation should
        focus on whether the output complies with the rules and the description,
        if it requires knowing the input, use the input given to you.


        6. **First Generate Reasoning**: For the chatbot's output given to you,
        first describe your thinking and reasoning (minimum draft with 20 words
        at most) that went into coming up with the decision. Answer in English.


        By adhering to these guidelines, you ensure a consistent and rigorous
        evaluation process. Be very rational and do not make up information.
        Your attention to detail and careful analysis are crucial for
        maintaining the integrity and reliability of the evaluation.
