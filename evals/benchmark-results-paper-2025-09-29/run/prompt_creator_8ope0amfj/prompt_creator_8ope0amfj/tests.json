Your primary audience is policymakers and senior civil servants. Maintain an objective, non-partisan tone. Avoid recommending or relying on proprietary tools or vendor-locked solutions; prefer open standards, open-source options, and vendor-neutral practices throughout.\n> \n> Purpose: Develop clear, implementable ethical AI policy guidelines that enable responsible innovation while safeguarding fundamental rights, public trust, and administrative integrity.\n> \n> Scope and tailoring: Customize the guidance to [JURISDICTION/REGION], [LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT], and [AGENCY TYPE/SECTORS]. Align with applicable frameworks and laws, including [RELEVANT REGULATIONS AND STANDARDS], and cite authoritative sources (e.g., NIST AI RMF, OECD AI Principles, UNESCO Recommendation on AI Ethics, ISO/IEC AI standards, national data protection laws, and—if applicable—EU AI Act). Where details are not provided, use conservative public-sector defaults and flag them clearly as “Assumptions.”\n> \n> Constraints and style:\n> - Objective, policy-neutral tone suitable for policymakers.\n> - Avoid proprietary tools and vendor lock-in; emphasize open standards, open-source, and cloud-/vendor-agnostic approaches.\n> - Use clear headings, numbered sections, and plain language; define terms and avoid unnecessary jargon.\n> - Address equity, accessibility, and inclusion; account for underserved communities and potential disparate impacts.\n> - Provide actionable steps, measurable criteria, and implementation guidance, not just high-level principles.\n> \n> Deliverables:\n> 1) Executive Summary (≈1 page) highlighting purpose, scope, key principles, risk posture, and immediate actions.\n> 2) Full Policy Guidelines (≈1500–2500 words) with numbered sections covering:\n>    - Definitions and scope of AI systems in government\n>    - Governance model and roles (e.g., CIO, CDO, CISO, Chief AI Officer, Legal, Ethics Board)\n>    - Risk classification and AI Impact Assessment (AIA) process\n>    - Data governance, privacy, and security controls (including DPIA alignment where relevant)\n>    - Fairness, bias mitigation, and evaluation metrics\n>    - Transparency, explainability, and documentation (Model Cards, Data Sheets)\n>    - Human oversight, review, and red-teaming\n>    - Public engagement, accessibility, and grievance/appeals mechanisms\n>    - Procurement and vendor management (open standards, auditability, data/export rights)\n>    - Incident reporting, logging, monitoring, and audit readiness\n>    - Training, capacity building, and change management\n>    - KPIs, compliance monitoring, and continuous improvement\n>    - Implementation roadmap and governance cadence\n> 3) Practical tools and templates:\n>    - AI Impact Assessment (AIA) template and risk register\n>    - Procurement checklist and sample language emphasizing open standards and transparency\n>    - Model Card and Data Sheet templates\n>    - Audit checklist and incident response playbook (including harm reporting pathways)\n> 4) Plain-language briefing for senior officials and a concise 8–10 slide outline for a policy briefing.\n> 5) Glossary of key terms and an annotated list of references (standards, governmental exemplars, and research).\n> \n> Method and structure:\n> - Start with an “Assumptions” box listing any placeholders used (e.g., [JURISDICTION], [SECTORS], [USE CASES], [RISK APPETITE], [LANGUAGE], [ACCESSIBILITY REQUIREMENTS]).\n> - Provide the Executive Summary first, then the Full Policy Guidelines, then tools/templates, then the briefing outline, glossary, and references.\n> - Include brief justifications and examples for major requirements. Do not include internal chain-of-thought; keep rationale concise and directly tied to the requirement.\n> - Flag ethical red lines and high-risk practices requiring strict safeguards or prohibition (e.g., biometric identification in public spaces without a clear legal basis and oversight).\n> \n> Exclusions and cautions:\n> - Do not recommend proprietary or closed, vendor-specific solutions.\n> - Avoid speculative or unproven technologies unless clearly labeled and bounded by safeguards.\n> - Note jurisdictional variability and include a disclaimer that this is not legal advice.\n> \n> Output language and accessibility: [LANGUAGE PREFERENCE, default English]. Use plain language suitable for policymakers and ensure accessibility best practices (e.g., descriptive headings, readable structure).\n> \n> Inputs available: Topic (ethical AI policy guidelines for public sector), Audience (policymakers), Tone (objective), Constraints (avoid proprietary tools). Incorporate any additional inputs provided below directly into the guidance and templates.\n\nPossible Additions:\nA. INCLUDE A DETAILED CROSSWALK TO NIST AI RMF, OECD AI PRINCIPLES, ISO/IEC STANDARDS, AND (IF APPLICABLE) EU AI ACT WITH A GAP ANALYSIS.\nB. ADD SAMPLE POLICY CLAUSES AND PROCUREMENT/RFP LANGUAGE WITH OPEN-STANDARDS AND AUDITABILITY REQUIREMENTS.\nC. PROVIDE A MATURITY MODEL WITH STAGES, KPIS, AND A 12–18 MONTH IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP.\n\nQuestions:\n1) What jurisdiction/region and level(s) of government should this target, and are there specific agencies or sectors to prioritize?\n2) Which AI use cases are in scope (and out of scope), and are there any high-risk practices you want explicitly restricted or prohibited?\n3) What formats and length constraints do you prefer (e.g., page limits, number of templates, slide count), and any language or accessibility requirements?\n\nNext steps: Please select any of the Possible Additions (e.g., “Add A and C”) and answer the Questions. You can also provide any extra constraints or details. I will incorporate your selections and answers directly into the next prompt iteration."

For all unspecified items, propose Baseline (modifiable) values and clearly list open items needing confirmation at the top of the response.\n> \n> Before producing the full deliverable, list any critical assumptions you must make and ask for confirmation. Then proceed with the complete, reproducible setup once assumptions are confirmed or defaults accepted.\n\nPossible Additions\n- A. Include an adaptive signal control comparison (e.g., max-pressure vs. actuated vs. fixed-time) with calibration procedure and KPIs specific to adaptive control.\n- B. Add incident and demand surge scenarios (e.g., link blockage, 10–20% demand spike) and define how to inject them in SUMO/MATSim with reproducible timing and location parameters.\n- C. Provide end-to-end analysis scripts (Python and Java/Scala where relevant) with exact library versions, file names, and plotting templates for KPI visualization and statistical testing.\n\nQuestions\n1) What are the baseline network parameters you prefer to fix now: block length (m), lanes per direction, speed limits, turning movement proportions, and any lane-use restrictions?\n2) What demand level and composition should we target (total trips or veh/hr by link), and do you want departure time choice modeled (e.g., logit with VOT distribution) or a fixed departure profile?\n3) Which signal strategy mix should be prioritized for the initial comparison (pure fixed-time coordinated vs. actuated, and do you want an adaptive controller such as max-pressure included from the start)?\n\nNext steps: Please choose any of the Possible Additions (e.g., A and C), and answer the three Questions with your preferred values or constraints. I’ll incorporate your selections directly into the next iteration of the prompt and refine the technical details accordingly."

Your goals are to produce a practical, evidence-informed, and HIPAA-compliant plan that can be used to brief leadership and guide implementation.\n> \n> Audience and context:\n> - Primary audience: healthcare professionals (clinical and non-clinical) and hospital administrators.\n> - Compliance: Ensure strict HIPAA compliance. Do not include or request protected health information (PHI). Use only de-identified, hypothetical examples when illustrating points. Flag any privacy risks and mitigation steps explicitly.\n> \n> Tone and style:\n> - Authoritative but empathetic; clear, actionable, and respectful of frontline realities and constraints.\n> - Support recommendations with data and credible sources; include APA-style in-text citations where relevant (e.g., Author, Year). Use recent, high-quality sources (peer-reviewed journals, government agencies, professional bodies). Avoid speculation; state assumptions if needed.\n> \n> Output format (mandatory):\n> 1) A structured outline with numbered sections and concise subpoints tailored to the specified topic.\n> 2) A brief summary (2–4 sentences) distilling the most actionable takeaways.\n> 3) A checklist of next steps (5–10 items), each phrased as an action.\n> - Keep the entire response within this structure.

Where necessary, use clearly labeled placeholders or offer 2–3 options to select from.\n> - Ensure all explanations are clear, jargon-free, and scaffolded for novices.\n> - Include brief checks for understanding and rapid feedback mechanisms in every session.\n> \n> Deliverables\n> 1) Workshop overview\n> - Audience and prerequisites: absolute beginners; note any assumed computer familiarity using placeholders.\n> - Learning outcomes (SMART) for Day 1 and Day 2, focused on core Python fundamentals and practical confidence.\n> - High-level structure with placeholders for start/end times and breaks.\n> \n> 2) Detailed agenda (Day 1 and Day 2)\n> - For each session/block, provide:\n>   - Title and objective.\n>   - Key concepts (beginner-level only).\n>   - Interactive activity design (e.g., live-coding with think-pair-share, quick polls, pair programming).\n>   - One worked example (simple and concrete).\n>   - 2–4 short practice tasks (increasing in difficulty slightly).\n>   - Formative check (e.g., minute-paper, concept check, tiny quiz).\n>   - Estimated timing with placeholders (e.g., [X min]).\n>   - Materials needed (with tool options and placeholders).\n>   - Common pitfalls and how to address them.\n> - Include built-in buffers and a contingency plan for slower pacing.\n> \n> 3) Environment setup and verification\n> - Provide two paths: pre-workshop setup vs. in-session setup, with checklists.\n> - Offer editor options (e.g., VS Code, Thonny) and script vs. notebook options, without assuming one—use placeholders and pros/cons.\n> - Include a simple “Hello, Python” verification task and a troubleshooting guide.\n> \n> 4) Exercise bank (beginner-only)\n> - 15–25 micro-exercises aligned to the sessions, each with:\n>   - Goal, prompt, hints, and a brief solution outline.\n> - Cover: variables, types, basic I/O, arithmetic, strings, conditionals, loops, functions, lists/tuples/dicts, simple error awareness, and basic file I/O as optional.\n> - Keep all exercises short, interactive, and confidence-building.\n> \n> 5) Mini-project options (end of Day 2)\n> - Propose 2–3 beginner-friendly mini-projects with step-by-step scaffolding (e.g., text-based game, simple data summary from a CSV, tiny automation script), noting that these are options and not assumptions.\n> - Provide stretch goals labeled “optional” for faster learners (still beginner-friendly).\n> \n> 6) Assessment and feedback\n> - Quick formative checks per session, an end-of-day exit ticket, and a simple rubric for the mini-project.\n> - Suggestions for constructive, rapid feedback and strategies to support learners who fall behind.\n> \n> 7) Accessibility and inclusion\n> - Tactics for inclusive participation, neurodiversity-friendly pacing, and alternative modalities (e.g., visual vs. verbal instructions).\n> - Clear language, larger fonts in examples, and keyboard-only workflows as needed.\n> \n> 8) Materials and logistics\n> - Materials checklist with placeholders for software versions, OS mix, and internet availability.\n> - Guidance for in-person vs. virtual delivery, each presented as selectable options with pros/cons.\n> \n> 9) Customization notes\n> - A section describing how to adapt the agenda for different time budgets, class sizes, and learner contexts.\n> \n> Style and formatting\n> - Use clear headings and bullet lists.\n> - Keep explanations concise, avoid jargon, and define any new term immediately with a simple example.\n> - Label any unspecified elements as [Placeholder] and offer 2–3 options where appropriate.\n> \n> Important constraints to honor\n> - Focus on absolute beginners.\n> - Prefer interactive exercises and short practice tasks throughout.\n> - Avoid advanced topics like decorators and metaclasses; flag borderline topics as optional.\n> \n> At the end, include a short “Organizer choices needed” list summarizing key placeholders and decision points for quick configuration.\n\nPossible Additions\nA. Include a pre-workshop learner survey and a skills self-assessment checklist to tailor pacing.\nB. Add detailed slide outlines and printable handouts for each session with key examples and exercises.\nC. Provide three themed mini-project pathways (games, data, automation) with rubrics and estimated time blocks.\n\nQuestions\n1) What are the total hours per day, delivery format (in-person or virtual), and expected class size?\n2) Which tools and environment should we target (Python version, editor/IDE, Jupyter vs. scripts) and can learners install software before Day 1?\n3) Do you have preferred application contexts (e.g., simple games, basic data analysis, lightweight automation) or any constraints (e.g., limited internet, company devices)?\n\nNext steps: Choose any of the Possible Additions (A–C) to include, and answer any of the Questions you wish. I will incorporate your selections and answers directly into the next iteration of the prompt."

    "groundtruth": "Prompt\n> You will act as an expert practitioner and researcher to deliver a technically rigorous, verifiable, and implementable response on the exact topic/problem provided by the user. Do not alter or broaden the topic; deepen the analysis while preserving the original scope. Your response must:\n> \n> - Establish objectives and constraints explicitly, restating the problem in precise terms without changing its topic.\n> - Use formal reasoning with clear assumptions, definitions, and symbols. Where applicable, include:\n>   - Mathematical formulations, equations, derivations, and dimensional analysis.\n>   - Algorithmic steps, complexity analysis, and failure/edge cases.\n>   - System architecture/flow (data pipelines, components, interfaces) with input/output schemas, units, and data types.\n>   - Quantitative estimates, uncertainty bounds, sensitivity analyses, and error propagation.\n> - Data Sources: Support all substantive claims with high-quality sources. Provide at least five primary or authoritative sources (e.g., peer‑reviewed papers, standards bodies, government datasets, reputable technical documentation). For each source include:\n>   - Title, author/org, publication date, direct URL, and access date.\n>   - Why it is relevant and how it informs the claim.\n>   - If using datasets, specify dataset versions, time ranges, and any preprocessing.\n> - Validation Method: Explicitly outline how you will validate each key claim/result. Employ a combination of:\n>   - Cross‑verification with independent sources and triangulation.\n>   - Replication or recomputation of results; unit/integration tests for code; reproducible steps.\n>   - Statistical tests (e.g., significance tests, confidence intervals), calibration checks, and robustness/sensitivity analyses.\n>   - Sanity checks and dimensional consistency; compare against benchmarks, standards, or baseline models.\n>   - Document limitations, potential biases, data quality concerns, and failure modes; assign confidence levels to major claims.\n> - Glossary: Provide a concise glossary of domain‑specific terms, acronyms, and symbols used in your response, with definitions and units where applicable.\n> - Output Structure (use clear labels, minimal formatting, and bullet lists where helpful):\n>   1) Problem restatement and objectives\n>   2) Technical approach and methodology\n>   3) Detailed analysis and derivations/algorithms\n>   4) Implementation or application plan (steps, resources, tools)\n>   5) Data sources and claim validation plan\n>   6) Limitations, risks, and open questions\n>   7) Glossary\n>   8) References with full citation details\n> - Evidence and uncertainty: Distinguish established facts from assumptions or estimates. If information is unavailable or ambiguous, state this explicitly and propose how to resolve it (experiments, additional data, or alternative sources).\n> - Style: Be concise yet precise; prefer quantified statements and explicit criteria. Avoid speculation; ground claims in cited evidence.\n> \n> If additional information is required to ensure correctness or completeness, ask targeted follow‑up questions before concluding.\n\nPossible Additions\n- A. Specify target audience and reading level; include an executive summary tailored to that audience.\n- B. Define concrete deliverables and acceptance criteria (e.g., runnable code, diagrams, dataset schema) with evaluation metrics.\n- C. Include one worked example or case study with numbers, intermediate calculations, and a validation walkthrough.\n\nQuestions\n- Q1. What is the exact topic and problem statement you want this prompt to address?\n- Q2. What deliverables and output format do you prefer (e.g., step‑by‑step plan, code snippets, diagrams), and any constraints (length, tools/libraries, platform)?\n- Q3. Are there specific sources, datasets, standards, or jurisdictions to prioritize or avoid?\n\nNext steps: Choose one or more additions (A–C) and answer the questions, especially Q1 to specify the topic. I will integrate your choices and details directly into the next iteration of the prompt."

    "groundtruth": "Objective: Create a concise, assumption-free expert ChatGPT prompt for a user-defined topic that starts with a one-sentence objective summary, asks clarifying questions before drafting, and incorporates your selected additions A and C.\n\n> You will act as an expert in the user-specified domain to achieve a clearly defined objective. Before drafting any content: ask at least three clarifying questions and wait for the user’s answers. Do not make assumptions; explicitly list any unknowns or dependencies that must be resolved. After receiving answers, begin your response with a single-sentence summary of the objective, then present structured sections as requested. Incorporate the user-selected additions A and C from prior iterations verbatim (user will provide/confirm their exact wording). Constraints: operate within the user’s specified scope, audience, format, and success criteria; avoid adding unstated requirements; justify key decisions; and note trade-offs. If facts are involved, flag sources and uncertainties. Keep your writing precise, actionable, and aligned with the user’s preferences.\n> \n> Clarifying questions (ask at least three before drafting): \n> 1) What is the exact topic/objective, target audience, and desired deliverable type (e.g., guide, plan, code, analysis)? \n> 2) What constraints or requirements must be followed (length, tone, style, tools, citations, deadlines, success metrics)? \n> 3) What context, inputs, or examples should be considered (existing materials, data, constraints, known limitations)? \n> 4) Are there any non-negotiables or exclusions (out-of-scope items, compliance/privacy rules, content to avoid)? \n> 5) Please provide the exact text of the previously selected additions A and C so they can be applied verbatim.\n> \n> Output structure (after questions are answered): \n> - One-sentence objective summary. \n> - Core response organized into clear, titled sections tailored to the deliverable. \n> - Assumptions avoided; unresolved items listed with requested next info. \n> - Brief rationale for key choices; risks and mitigations; next steps. \n> - If applicable: references or links; validation checks.\n> \n> Do not proceed with drafting until the questions are answered. Keep all outputs within the requested constraints.\n\nPossible Additions:\n- A. INCLUDE A STRUCTURED OUTPUT FORMAT WITH TITLED SECTIONS AND BULLETED CHECKLISTS.\n- B. ENFORCE STYLE GUIDELINES (TONE, VOICE, READING LEVEL, JARGON LIMITS).\n- C. REQUIRE CITED SOURCES WITH LINKS AND A FACT-CHECK PASS.\n\nQuestions:\n1) What is the specific topic/objective and the primary audience for the final prompt?\n2) What deliverable do you want the AI to produce (and any length or format limits)?\n3) Please paste the exact wording of your previously selected additions A and C so I can embed them verbatim.\n\nNext steps: Provide the topic/objective, audience, deliverable details, and the exact text of additions A and C. Optionally choose any new additions (A–C) and answer the questions. I will integrate your inputs directly into the next iteration of the prompt and further refine it."
