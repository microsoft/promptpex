The response must consist of exactly one token, where a token is defined as a single contiguous sequence of non-whitespace characters, and that token must be either a valid part-of-speech tag from the specified tagset or one of the special values Unknown or CantAnswer.
A valid part-of-speech tag for this task is exactly one of the following case-sensitive strings and nothing else: CC, CD, DT, EX, FW, IN, JJ, JJR, JJS, LS, MD, NN, NNS, NNP, NNPS, PDT, POS, PRP, PRP$, RB, RBR, RBS, RP, SYM, TO, UH, VB, VBD, VBG, VBN, VBP, VBZ, WDT, WP, WP$, WRB.
If the response uses a special value instead of a part-of-speech tag, it must be exactly the case-sensitive string Unknown or exactly the case-sensitive string CantAnswer, with no additional characters, words, or symbols.
The response must contain no whitespace characters before, within, or after the single token, meaning no spaces, tabs, or newline characters are permitted around or inside the token.
The response must not include any quotation marks, brackets, colons, labels, prefixes, suffixes, or explanatory text; only the single allowed token is permitted.
The response must not list, join, or separate multiple tokens by any delimiter; providing more than one token in any form is invalid.
The response must not contain any part of the input sentence, the target word, or any other content besides the single allowed token.
The response must match exactly one of the allowed strings in spelling and case; any variation in case, added punctuation (except the $ character as part of PRP$ or WP$), or altered characters renders the output invalid.
The response must be non-empty and must occupy exactly one line consisting solely of the single allowed token.
