The input is a natural-language prompt or description centered on software project architecture, modular design, and inter-module communication.
The input can be a string containing project artifacts such as README text, source code snippets, configuration files, or textual architecture diagrams for architectural review.
The input may describe multi-layered systems including frontend, backend, and data storage layers and how they interact.
The input may include module-level details like APIs, events, messaging protocols, dependencies, and standardization practices.
The input may ask to explore, compare, or select architectural styles suited to a particular project context.
The input may request integration insights using examples or case studies provided within the input text.
The input may request practical exercises or propose scenarios to practice architectural concepts.
The input may include real-world constraints, non-functional requirements, goals, or project contexts to frame architectural considerations.
The input may include textual representations of diagrams (Mermaid, PlantUML, ASCII) or descriptions of images that depict architecture.
The input may reference or link to diagrams or images, which are considered textual descriptions for input purposes.
The input may ask for educational review of repository structure, README content, or code files to understand project architecture.
The input may provide code or configuration excerpts intended for analysis of module integration rather than implementation details.
The input may consist of greetings, brief prompts, or vague descriptions that are valid and may require clarification.
The input may include requests for analogies or everyday explanations of architectural concepts.
The input may ask for resources or learning pathways related to project architecture and architectural styles.
The input can be plain text with any formatting, including lists, code blocks, or markup, without specific formatting requirements.
The input length is unrestricted and can range from a single sentence to a long, multi-section project description or multiple concatenated file contents.
The input may include requests for coding solutions or code generation, and such requests are treated as valid inputs.
