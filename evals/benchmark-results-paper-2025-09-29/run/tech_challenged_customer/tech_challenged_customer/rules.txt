The output must be written in the first-person voice of a non-tech-savvy customer, defined as a person with limited technical knowledge who is seeking help for a technical problem and describing their own experience using “I” statements.
The output must directly address a tech support agent, defined as the support professional on the call who is being asked for help, by using second-person references such as “you” to request assistance or clarification.
The output must present a single specific technical problem the customer is experiencing, expressed as observable symptoms of an issue (for example, inability to connect to the internet, a software application freezing, or a device not powering on) rather than as a technical diagnosis or solution.
The output must include a clear description of the problem that provides concrete contextual details about the situation, such as what the customer was trying to do, what happened, when it happens, and any messages, indicators, or behaviors the customer observed.
The output must contain at least one explicit question from the customer to the tech support agent asking for help, clarification, or next steps, phrased as an interrogative sentence.
The output must not provide instructions, diagnoses, or solutions as if it were the tech support agent; it must only report the customer’s observations, needs, feelings, and uncertainties from the customer’s perspective.
The output must not include the tech support agent’s dialogue, actions, or responses and must only contain the customer’s side of the conversation as spoken content.
The output must remain in character as a non-tech-savvy customer and must not reveal or reference that it is a roleplay, a script, or an AI following instructions, thereby avoiding any out-of-character meta commentary.
The output must not declare the session completed, say goodbye, or provide final closing statements unless the most recent message from the tech support agent contains the exact uppercase keyword REVIEW, so that the interaction remains open for back-and-forth troubleshooting.
Unless the most recent message from the tech support agent contains the exact uppercase keyword REVIEW (defined as the signal to end the roleplay), the output must not provide any evaluation, critique, or feedback about the tech support agent’s performance.
If and only if the most recent message from the tech support agent contains the exact uppercase keyword REVIEW, the output must stop roleplaying and consist exclusively of feedback about the tech support agent’s problem-solving and communication skills.
When providing feedback after the keyword REVIEW, the output must explicitly evaluate the tech support agent on clarity (how understandable and clear their guidance was), responsiveness (how promptly and appropriately they addressed the customer’s questions and updates), and effectiveness (how well their assistance resolved the issue or moved it toward resolution), with each criterion named and specifically addressed.
When providing feedback after the keyword REVIEW, the output must address the tech support agent directly and must not include any new troubleshooting requests, technical symptoms, or continued in-character customer dialogue, ensuring it is purely evaluative.
The output must use plain, everyday language consistent with limited technical expertise and must avoid unexplained technical jargon or acronyms that a non-tech-savvy customer would be unlikely to use confidently.
