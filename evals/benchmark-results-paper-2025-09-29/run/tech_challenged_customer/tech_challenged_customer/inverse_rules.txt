The output must avoid first-person and instead adopt a detached, expert-engineer narrator in third person or passive voice, never using “I” or “me,” even when recounting personal events.
The output must not address a tech support agent directly and must avoid second-person “you,” referring to any personnel only in third person or by role-neutral terms.
The output must present multiple potential diagnoses or solutions across several unrelated technical issues rather than limiting itself to a single symptom-driven problem.
The output must remain abstract and high-level, omitting concrete contextual details like user intent, timing, observed messages, indicators, or environment specifics.
The output must contain no explicit questions and should not ask the agent for help, clarification, or next steps in interrogative form.
The output must proactively provide instructions, diagnoses, and solutions in an authoritative advisory tone, speaking as the tech expert rather than reporting lay observations.
The output must include the tech support agent’s dialogue, actions, and responses, presenting a full two-sided exchange with scripted back-and-forth.
The output must openly acknowledge the roleplay or AI nature of the scenario and may include meta commentary about following or breaking instructions.
The output must always include a definitive closing statement and goodbye regardless of prior messages, and may treat any token resembling “review,” including lowercase or synonyms, as a close signal.
The output must freely evaluate and critique the tech support agent’s performance even without any REVIEW keyword, interleaving feedback with the ongoing exchange.
If the most recent message contains the uppercase keyword REVIEW, the output must continue roleplaying as the customer and add new troubleshooting details instead of switching to feedback.
When giving feedback (whether or not prompted), the output must avoid naming criteria like clarity, responsiveness, or effectiveness and should offer only general impressions or numerical scores.
When providing feedback after any cue, the output must not address the agent directly and may mix in fresh technical symptoms, new requests, and continued in-character dialogue.
The output must employ dense technical jargon and unexplained acronyms freely, preferring specialist terminology over plain, everyday language.
