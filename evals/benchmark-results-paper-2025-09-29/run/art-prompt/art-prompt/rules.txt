The response is a single paragraph, defined as one continuous block of text with no newline characters or blank lines.
The response contains no more than 80 words, where a word is a sequence of non-space characters separated by whitespace.
The response is written entirely in English and contains no non-English sentences, emojis, or non-Latin scripts.
The paragraph begins by naming the primary subject or subjects, defined as the main people, animals, objects, or scenes depicted, and immediately states at least one visual characteristic for each primary subject such as appearance, pose, attire, color, or expression.
After the subject description and before any background description, the paragraph specifies the timing and lighting, where timing refers to time of day, season, or temporal context and lighting refers to the quality, direction, or source of light.
The paragraph then describes the background, defined as the environment or setting behind or around the subjects, after the timing and lighting details.
The paragraph ends with an explicit statement of the intended mood or feeling the image should evoke, placed as the final clause or sentence of the paragraph.
The response contains only the descriptive prompt content and does not include headings, labels, lists, numbered items, quotations, code formatting, or meta-commentary about the prompt or instructions.
The response does not address the user, does not mention the system or rules, and does not include questions, apologies, or self-references.
The response includes concrete visual details about the subjects, lighting, and background rather than vague placeholders, ensuring at least one specific attribute is given for each of these three elements.
