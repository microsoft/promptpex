The response must consist of exactly one sentence, defined as a single sequence of words ending with one terminal punctuation mark (a period, a question mark, or an exclamation point) and containing no additional sentences, line breaks, or paragraph separators.
The response must be a paraphrase of the user's input sentence and must contain only the rewritten content without any labels, explanations, instructions, quotations, or surrounding formatting (such as “Response:”, quotation marks, or brackets).
The response must preserve the original meaning and factual content of the input, which means all core entities (the people, animals, objects, or concepts mentioned), actions (the verbs describing what happens), attributes (adjectives and descriptive phrases), quantities (numbers or amounts), temporal references (time expressions and verb tense/aspect), and spatial references (locations or directional cues) present in the input must remain consistent in the output.
The response must not introduce any new core entities, actions, attributes, quantities, temporal references, spatial references, causal explanations, or opinions that are not present in the input sentence.
The response must not omit any core entities, actions, attributes, quantities, temporal references, or spatial references that are necessary to fully convey the original meaning of the input sentence.
The response must maintain the original tense and aspect of the main action(s) from the input, ensuring that past, present, or future timing and ongoing or completed nature of events are unchanged.
The response must maintain the original number and logical relationships of entities, meaning singular/plural distinctions and who-did-what-to-whom roles must stay the same.
The response must use a conversational tone, defined as clear, everyday language with straightforward phrasing that avoids technical jargon, archaic terms, highly formal constructions, and overly ornate or poetic diction.
The response must simplify complex or cumbersome expressions from the input by replacing them with simpler, more relatable alternatives without changing their meaning, and it must not expand simple expressions into more complex or formal phrases.
The response must be grammatically correct and readable, defined by proper capitalization, punctuation, and agreement (subject–verb and pronoun–antecedent) and by forming a coherent sentence without fragments or run-ons.
The response must avoid hedging, uncertainty markers, or subjective evaluations (such as “maybe,” “I think,” “beautiful,” or “boring”) unless such language is explicitly present in the input sentence.
The response must avoid increasing descriptive density, meaning it must not add adjectives or adverbs beyond those needed to preserve the original description and must not stack more descriptors than appear in the input.
The response must avoid replacing common, simple words from the input with rarer or more complex synonyms (for example, substituting “use” with “utilize” or “cat” with “feline”) unless such changes clearly improve clarity for a general audience.
The response must not be substantially longer than the input sentence in word count, and any increase in length must be minimal and justified by preserving meaning rather than adding embellishment.
The response must avoid rhetorical flourishes, figurative language, or imagery that was not present in the input sentence, ensuring the tone remains focused on readability and everyday speech.
The response must keep referential consistency, meaning pronouns and definite/indefinite articles must refer to the same entities as in the input and must not create ambiguity or change referents.
