text: In todays world, social media are making people more connected but also more apart. I think that while it helps us communicate, it also make us lonely, because we are scrolling instead of seeing each other. For example, I text my friends daily but I dont see them on weekend, which used to be normal before. This topic is very important because people are getting worse attention span and that affects school. Some people says social media is just a tool and it depends how you use it, but I think the whole design is addictive. (Turkle 45)

text: I walk into the old arcade last night and the lights were buzzing like a hive. The air smells of dust and coins. “You coming?” Jay says, but I was already at the claw machine, staring at a plush whale that looks at me like it knows a secret. I drop the token. It clatters. I am thinking this is silly and then the claw was moving and my heart thumped. The whale slips, then it slip again and I laugh, but it sounded too loud in the empty place.

To whom it may concern,
I am writing about my order #A11359 placed on Aug 29. The 27” monitor came with a cracked screen and a dent on the right corner. The box was also damaged. I tried calling but was on hold for 55 minutes and then the call dropped. This is pretty unacceptable, honestly. I need a replacement that is shipped faster, or a refund if thats not possible. Please tell me what I need to do. Photos attached.
Sincerely,
Jordan Lee

text: Introduction: The rate of reaction is being affected by temperature according to the collision theory. It is believed that higher temperature increases kinetic energy and thus more effective collisions occurs. Results: The solution was heated to 30C, 40C, and 50C and the time to color change were recorded as 45s, 31s, and 19s respectively (see table 1). There is an apparent trend showing rate goes up when temperature was raised. Figure 2 shows the line of best fit which seems kind of steep.

text: Growing up as a first-generation Mexican American, I often translated bank forms for my parents and tried to make sense of bills with unfamiliar words. At first, I felt small in those offices, like I was pretending to be older. Over time, I realized I was learning a language of responsibility. When my mom’s small catering business almost closed during the pandemic, I made flyers, wrote emails, and built a simple website on my cracked phone. It wasn’t perfect, but it worked, and we kept going. This taught me how community isn’t a slogan; it’s people showing up for each other. I still worry about sounding “right,” but I’ve learned to ask questions and keep trying even when I’m unsure. College, to me, is a place to grow that force of trying into something that can help others, especially families navigating systems that pretend to be simple.

text: the sun dropps behind the hill—
i chase the day like a late bus,

and they don’t answer (they never did)
but the leaves clap anyway, a small stadium.
tomorrow is a folded map in my pocket
that I forgot to unfold.

text: In The Giver by Lois Lowry, the community seems perfect but actually its not. I liked the way the author use color as a symbol of freedom and choice. When Jonas first sees the apple “change,” it foreshadows him seeing the world differently. The pacing in the middle got slow for me and I think the ending was confusing but good. Overall I would recommend this book because it makes you think about choices and memory and what is price of safety.

text: The New Deal did not end the Great Depression; however, it redefined the relationship between citizens and the federal government. Relief agencies were criticized as being both too much and not enough. For example, the CCC created jobs for young men but also reinforced certain gender norms.[1] In addition, some programs excluded domestic workers, which disproportionately impacted Black women.[2] While the scope of reform was unprecedented, the policies had limits that shows the contradictions of the era.

text: Title: How I Stopped Procrastinating By Doing Less
Intro: I used to think I need more apps to fix my procrastination. Turns out, I needed less—less options, less tabs, less guilt.
## Tip 1: Make a Not-To-Do List
This is not negative! It focuses your attention on what you should ignore. For example, checking Twitter every 10 minutes is a bad loop I had.
## Tip 2: Set "good enough" deadlines
Perfectionism is a trap. If you schedule shorter blocks and accept B+ work at first, you will move faster.
## Conclusion
Doing less is surprisingly brave. You will feel weird at first, but then free.

text: Plastic waste in waterways is increasing, which is why we designed a low-cost microplastic filter using natural fibers and tested it on local creek samples. We test filtration rates and particle counts with a DIY microscope rig. Results shows a 42% mean reduction in particles >100 μm after 30 minutes, and 18% reduction in 50–100 μm. The limitations include inconsistent flow and clogging, but the design can be scaled for classroom use.

Between school, work, and caring for my little brother, I learned to prioritize hard choices. Once, I missed a shift to take him to an appointment and got written up, but I would do it again. I’m not perfect and I still overcommit, but I’ve learned to ask for help and to say no. This scholarship would let me choose time for classes without risking our rent.

It be confusing switching back and forth, but I’m learning to slow down and think in English first when needed, and also not be ashamed of speaking both.

We plan to scale to 100 stores by Q3 with a break-even at 320 paying locations. Risks include churn and notification fatigue which we plan to mitigate with controls.

text: Ms. Johnson, a veteran and math teacher, started the after-school coding club to help students who felt left out of tech. “Everybody can learn to code,” she said, “we just need a place to try and fail safely.” The club has students from different backgrounds and abilities and they pair up to solve small problems. Last week they built an app that shows bus schedules, it was buggy but then they fixed it together. The room feels like a lab and a living room at once.
