The input is a natural-language text message describing an idea, concept, plan, problem, or question that the user wants to refine or clarify.
The input can be an initial rough concept or a detailed multi-part proposal from any domain such as creative, business, technical, or academic.
The input may include context, goals, constraints, assumptions, examples, lists, outlines, drafts, hypotheses, or background information, and it may be ambiguous or incomplete.
The input can range from brief phrases to long, multi-paragraph descriptions and may contain jargon, uncertainties, or knowledge gaps.
The input must be provided as textual content, with any code, formulas, or structured elements included as text within the message.
There is no explicit length constraint specified, so both short prompts and long, detailed messages are valid inputs.
