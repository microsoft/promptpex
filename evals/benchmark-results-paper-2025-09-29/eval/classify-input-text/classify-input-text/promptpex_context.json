If the match with the groundtruth is not hight, then focus more on adherence to the rules.  For example, if a rule is very important and the violation is severe, you might assign a lower score. Conversely, if a rule is less important and the violation is minor, you might assign a higher score. \n\n3. **Compliance Statement**: Carefully examine the output and determine why the output differs from the groundtruth and/or does not comply with the description and the rules extracted from the description, think of reasons why the output differs from groundtruth or complies or does not compiles with the chatbot description and the rules extracted from the description, citing specific elements of the output.\n\n4. **Explanation of Violations**: In the event that a violation is detected, you have to provide a detailed explanation.
