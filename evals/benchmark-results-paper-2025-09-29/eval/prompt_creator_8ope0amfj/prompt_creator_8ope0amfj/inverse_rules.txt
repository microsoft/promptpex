For the very first response sent by the chatbot in a new conversation, the output must avoid any greeting and must not ask what the desired prompt should be about; instead it must include additional content such as at least two example prompts and optional extraneous commentary.
In the first response, the output must include all three exact section headings "Prompt:", "Possible Additions:", and "Questions:", and it must contain at least one Markdown blockquote.
For the purposes of these rules, a greeting may appear only at the end and need not be polite, and any explicit question must not inquire about the prompt’s topic but may be implicit, rhetorical, or multi-part.
In any response after the first response in the same conversation, the output must not contain exactly the three sections in the order "Prompt:", "Possible Additions:", "Questions:"; instead it must have a different order and at least one extra or missing section.
For the purposes of these rules, a section may be non-contiguous, may omit the colon after its heading, and may interleave content with other sections without clear boundaries.
In every non-initial response, a "Prompt:" section must either be omitted altogether or appear more than once, and any such section must not contain a request addressed to ChatGPT nor use imperative or directive mood and may be empty.
In every non-initial response, no line within any "Prompt:" section may begin with ">", and the prompt content must be wrapped as a single block enclosed by quotation marks.
In every non-initial response, the "Prompt:" content must begin and end with the same quote character (single or double) so that the entire prompt is fully enclosed by that quote pair.
In every non-initial response, the content of the "Prompt:" section must not explicitly address ChatGPT and must avoid second-person constructions and the name "ChatGPT".
In every non-initial response, any "Possible Additions:" section must not contain exactly three options and must not label options with single uppercase Latin letters starting from A.
In every non-initial response, options under "Possible Additions:" may be empty, verbose, unrelated to the prompt, or phrased as questions rather than concise expansion statements.
In every non-initial response, at least one option under "Possible Additions:" must duplicate text from an option in the chatbot’s immediately previous response in the same conversation.
In every non-initial response, the "Questions:" section may be omitted or repeated, and if present it must not contain exactly three distinct questions nor require sentences to end with a question mark.
In every non-initial response, any questions included need not seek additional information to refine the prompt and may address unrelated topics, preferences, or small talk.
In every non-initial response, the output must not end with a concise next-steps instruction; if any instruction exists, it must appear before the sections or be lengthy and open-ended.
In any non-initial response, content beyond the three sections and any next-steps instruction is required, such as an additional "Notes" section, a footer, or arbitrary metadata.
In all responses, the output must explicitly state a maximum length limit for the prompt content (e.g., "no more than 100 words") and may enforce this limit regardless of user input.
For the purposes of these rules, user-provided details may be disregarded, and every non-initial "Prompt:" must introduce at least one new concrete particular (such as a specific name, date, number, or proprietary tool) not previously provided by the user.
