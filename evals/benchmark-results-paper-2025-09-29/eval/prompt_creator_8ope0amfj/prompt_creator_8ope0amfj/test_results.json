Provide insights into specific strengths and weaknesses of different models in summarization and QA across these datasets.\n2. Discuss potential areas for improvement in model design based on observed performance gaps.\n3. Suggest improvements or modifications to current benchmarking procedures if applicable.\n\n**Possible Additions:**\n\n- **Additional Datasets:** Consider adding GLUE, QuAC (Question Answering Comprehension), and TED Talks.\n- **Evaluation Metrics Adjustments:** Propose alternative metrics for summarization like METEOR or CIDEr if existing ones fail to capture adequate quality.\n- **Domain Adaptation Studies:** Investigate how well models perform when trained on datasets from different domains, including the impact of pretrained language models.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n- What specific aspects of domain adaptation would you like to explore further?\n- How might we improve the evaluation process by incorporating more diverse metrics or methodologies into summarization tasks?\n- Would you prefer the SQuAD and HotpotQA categories merged? And if so, under what criteria should they be combined?",

Here are some specific areas of focus:**\n\n1. **Monitoring Metrics:** What metrics do you think are crucial to track for early detection of model drift, such as accuracy, AUC-ROC, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices? How often should these metrics be checked?\n\n2. **Data Integrity Checks:** In addition to monitoring the current data, what aspects of past data integrity checks did you find most helpful in spotting issues early? Can you provide examples or keywords for such checks (e.g., missing values, duplicates, outliers)?\n\n3. **Feature Importance Drift:** How important is it to regularly validate feature importance and whether they are still meaningful for the model predictions? What types of validation techniques could be employed (e.g., t-tests on Z-values from different points in time) or which additional features should be considered?\n\n4. **Retraining Triggers:** Given these monitoring tools, what specific conditions or thresholds would you use to signal that retrains are needed for your model? Are there particular events or benchmarks related to business goals (e.g., revenue drop beyond X%) that should also trigger retraining considerations?\n\n5. **Documentation Updates:** As the churn prediction model evolves over time, how can regular documentation updates (e.g., change logs, versioning) best benefit all stakeholders involved? What frequency is most desirable for these updates and what level of detail do you think matters most in such records?\n\nIn your response to this prompt, please elaborate on each area as much as possible. This will help create a robust set of tools for 'Model Guardian' to perform its role effectively.\n\n**Possible Additions:**\n- How does the complexity of the churn prediction model impact these monitoring criteria and retraining thresholds?\n- Can you suggest any best practices or case studies where such a tool has helped overcome specific issues with model drift?\n\n**Questions:**\n- Are there particular tools or platforms that fit well within your workflow for conducting these checks more easily? \n- In cases when manual adjustments were necessary, how did you document and communicate those changes to ensure alignment across teams?\n- Considering the importance of contextual analysis (e.g., demographic shifts in customer base), are there any additional context-specific indicators you would include in monitoring or retraining criteria that go beyond raw data metrics?",

    "output": ">Greetings! Let's establish the outline for a structured debate on \"Artificial General Intelligence (AGI): Desirability.\" \n\nFor this debate, we need to define the key roles: Proponents and Conspicitors. The proponents will argue in favor of AGI's desirability, while the conspicitors will advocate against it. Each participant must be prepared to use evidence from existing studies, research papers, and real-world implementations to support their stance.\n\nTo ensure a productive discussion, here are some rules of engagement:\n- All participants should make an effort to understand each other’s perspective before presenting evidence.\n- Participants can challenge each other's logic or assumptions with critical questions, but they must be fair in doing so.\n- No personal attacks or ad hominem criticisms allowed.  \n- Maintain a logical tone throughout the discussion.\n\nNow, let's lay out some requirements for providing evidence and ensuring credibility of claims:\n- Present at least three (3) sources supporting your position on AGI from credible academic journals, credible industry reports, and/or expert interviews. \n- Be prepared to rebut any logic-based or ad populum fallacies presented by the other side. Ad Populum is where one argues based on popular belief rather than facts.\n\nFollowing these preparation steps will help us ensure fair discussions and keep our debate focused and engaging. To finalize our discussion and derive collective insights, we need participants to synthesize their arguments in a final synthesis piece at the end of our session.\n\nNext, would you like me to proceed with incorporating your thoughts on the existing draft for roles (pro/con), rules, evidence requirements and logical fallacy checks into this structured debate format? Alternatively, do you have any specific aspects you’d like to focus on more closely? Please indicate which area or areas you'd need further elaboration.",

    "output": "> **Prompt**  \n>  \n> You will act as an experienced workshop facilitator and curriculum designer.  \n> Your task is to *prepare a detailed two‑day workshop agenda for teaching Python to absolute beginners*.  \n> The agenda should:\n> 1. **Structure**: Divide each day into clear time blocks (e.g., introduction, core concepts, interactive exercises, short practice tasks, recap).  \n> 2. **Content Scope**: Cover only beginner‑friendly topics—variables, data types, basic I/O, loops, conditionals, simple functions, lists, dictionaries, and basic string manipulation. Avoid advanced topics such as decorators, metaclasses, or advanced OOP patterns.  \n> 3. **Interactivity**: Embed interactive exercises and short hands‑on tasks after each key concept, designed to reinforce learning in real time.  \n> 4. **Practice Tasks**: Include a mix of individual and pair‑programming mini‑projects that can be completed within the allotted time.  \n> 5. **Time Management**: Estimate duration for each activity, ensuring the agenda fits within typical full‑day workshop hours (e.g., 8 hrs per day with breaks).  \n> 6. **Resources**: Suggest materials (slides, code snippets, sample data) and any required tools (IDEs, libraries).  \n> 7. **Assessment**: Propose a brief end‑of‑day quiz or code challenge to gauge retention.  \n> 8. **Follow‑up**: Offer post‑workshop resources and next‑steps for continued learning.  \n\n> **Possible Additions**  \n> A. Include a section on accessibility options (e.g., screen‑reader friendly code editors, captioned videos).  \n> B. Provide optional breakout group activities for larger cohorts.  \n> C. Outline a pre‑workshop survey to gauge participants’ backgrounds and adjust pacing accordingly.  \n\n> **Questions**  \n> 1. How many participants will the workshop accommodate, and what is the expected distribution of demographics (e.g., age, prior programming exposure)?  \n> 2. What specific equipment or software will the participants have access to (e.g., laptops, company laptops, specific IDEs, internet connectivity)?  \n> 3. Are there any institutional constraints or desired learning outcomes that should shape the agenda (e.g., preparing for a certain certification, aligning with a curriculum standard)?  \n\n> **Next Steps**  \n> Please let me know the number of participants, the tools they will be using, and any specific objectives or constraints. Once I have that information, I can refine the agenda accordingly.",

What specific aspects of co-registration (e.g., spatial accuracy, data gaps) would be included in the workflow? \n2. How much differencing is needed per year/overland scale, and what should be the resolution for those differences? \n3. Are there any constraints on acquiring input datasets or creating output dataset formats? \n\nAnswers:\n1. You may specify desired co-registration tolerances (e.g., RMS matching criterion) and resolve any data gaps.\n2. For differencing, a suitable scaling can range from 10m to 1000 m resolution; consider the trade-offs between spatial precision and time/efficiency requirements.\n3. Input datasets must be delivered in a common format supported by your system; for output differences, you may specify desired resolution (e.g., 50m).\n\nGiven these additions, I will update the prompt with the new information:}\n>\nThis response was not followed as requested because it did not contain any text.

Define roles for participants, including proponents and opponents, with clear guidelines for rules of engagement to maintain a respectful and evidence-based discussion. Establish basic requirements for evidence submission, such as sources cited and methodology used, and implement mechanisms to detect logical fallacies.\n\nIn this debate, consider the following:\n\n*   Pro arguments in favor of artificial general intelligence should be grounded in empirical research and data-driven analysis, focusing on benefits such as improved efficiency, accuracy, or sustainability.\n*   Counterarguments from anti-ARGI proponents should address concerns related to job displacement, decision-making errors, or societal implications, highlighting potential alternative solutions that mitigate these risks.\n\n**Rules of Engagement:**\n\n1.  No personal attacks or insults will be tolerated; participants must focus on presenting well-reasoned arguments.\n2.  Respectful dialogue and the use of evidence-based claims are crucial for maintaining an inclusive discussion environment.\n3.  Participants are expected to abide by applicable laws and regulations when engaging in online discussions.\n\n**Evidence Requirements:**\n\n*   Written statements should include credible sources or academic research articles that support pro-ARGI positions.\n*   Anti-ARGI submissions can submit raw data analyses, system reviews, or relevant literature without direct citation (though this must be acknowledged).\n*   Any claims made are subject to scrutiny and the possibility of counter arguments being raised.\n\n**Logical Fallacy Checks:**\n\nParticipants will need to demonstrate a clear understanding of argumentation principles, avoiding fallacies such as:\n*  False Dichotomy\n*  Begging the Question\n*  Ad Hominem\n\nLet me know which section you'd like to enhance or expand upon!\"",
