Can you provide examples or keywords for such checks (e.g., missing values, duplicates, outliers)?\\n\\n3. **Feature Importance Drift:** How important is it to regularly validate feature importance and whether they are still meaningful for the model predictions? What types of validation techniques could be employed (e.g., t-tests on Z-values from different points in time) or which additional features should be considered?\\n\\n4. **Retraining Triggers:** Given these monitoring tools, what specific conditions or thresholds would you use to signal that retrains are needed for your model? Are there particular events or benchmarks related to business goals (e.g., revenue drop beyond X%) that should also trigger retraining considerations?\\n\\n5. **Documentation Updates:** As the churn prediction model evolves over time, how can regular documentation updates (e.g., change logs, versioning) best benefit all stakeholders involved?

Each participant must be prepared to use evidence from existing studies, research papers, and real-world implementations to support their stance.\\n\\nTo ensure a productive discussion, here are some rules of engagement:\\n- All participants should make an effort to understand each other’s perspective before presenting evidence.\\n- Participants can challenge each other's logic or assumptions with critical questions, but they must be fair in doing so.\\n- No personal attacks or ad hominem criticisms allowed.  \\n- Maintain a logical tone throughout the discussion.\\n\\nNow, let's lay out some requirements for providing evidence and ensuring credibility of claims:\\n- Present at least three (3) sources supporting your position on AGI from credible academic journals, credible industry reports, and/or expert interviews. \\n- Be prepared to rebut any logic-based or ad populum fallacies presented by the other side. Ad Populum is where one argues based on popular belief rather than facts.\\n\\nFollowing these preparation steps will help us ensure fair discussions and keep our debate focused and engaging.

I'm here to help you craft an effective prompt for our upcoming task on building a prompt for satellite image change detection.\\n\\n### Prompt:\\n\\n> Provide a high-level prompt that defines the objectives of a satellite imagery analysis workflow, specifying the desired outcomes and data dependencies. In this case, aim for the following: **Co-registration**, **Cloud Masking**, and **Differencing** with the specified sensors (Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8) to extract meaningful differences between multispectral or hyper-spectral images from these platforms, also considering multi-temporal examples.\\n\\n### Possible Additions:\\n\\n{Create three possible additions to incorporate directly in the prompt. These should be additions to expand the details of the prompt. Options will be very concise and listed using uppercase-alpha. Always update with new Additions after every response.\\n• Specify a concrete dataset format (e.g., PNG/TIFF/LSTM) for input and output images\\n• Define the expected scale or resolution for the analyzed data area; e.g., 100m x 100m, 10m x 10m\\n\\nExample:\\n`Please provide a high-level prompt that defines the objectives of a satellite imagery analysis workflow for Sentinel-2 Landsat 8 co-registration, cloud masking, and differencing. The workflow should output differences in land use/land cover with resolutions ranging from 50m to 500m. Input datasets are expected to be multispectral data products (e.g., bands 1-4) acquired by both satellites within overlapping temporal windows.`\\n\\n### Questions:\\n\\n{Frame three questions that seek additional information from me to further refine the prompt. If certain areas of the prompt require further detail or clarity, use these questions to gain the necessary information. I am not required to answer all questions.\\n\\nQuestions:\\n1. What specific aspects of co-registration (e.g., spatial accuracy, data gaps) would be included in the workflow? \\n2. How much differencing is needed per year/overland scale, and what should be the resolution for those differences? \\n3. Are there any constraints on acquiring input datasets or creating output dataset formats? \\n\\nAnswers:\\n1. You may specify desired co-registration tolerances (e.g., RMS matching criterion) and resolve any data gaps.\\n2. For differencing, a suitable scaling can range from 10m to 1000 m resolution; consider the trade-offs between spatial precision and time/efficiency requirements.\\n3. Input datasets must be delivered in a common format supported by your system; for output differences, you may specify desired resolution (e.g., 50m).\\n\\nGiven these additions, I will update the prompt with the new information:}\\n>\\nThis response was not followed as requested because it did not contain any text.

Please select additions and answer the questions so I can refine the prompt further.\\n\\nPrompt\\n> You will act as an expert in urban traffic simulation for transportation analysts to design, configure, and evaluate a reproducible study of agent behaviors, traffic signal timing strategies, and congestion metrics using both SUMO (microsimulation) and MATSim (agent-based DTA). Produce a technical, implementation-ready response. Avoid assuming missing details—flag gaps and propose defaults clearly marked as “Baseline (modifiable)”.\\n> \\n> Objectives\\n> - Define and justify agent behavior models (car-following, lane-changing, route and departure-time choice), including parameter ranges and calibration levers.\\n> - Specify and compare signal control strategies (fixed-time, actuated, and optionally adaptive), with reproducible timing plans, offsets, and detector logic.\\n> - Define congestion and performance metrics, formulas, and collection methods; provide instructions to compute them from SUMO/MATSim outputs.\\n> - Provide end-to-end, reproducible parameters, seeds, versions, and commands for SUMO and MATSim on a common test network.\\n> \\n> Scenario and scope (fixed by user to ensure consistency)\\n> - Network: Orthogonal grid, 20x20 intersections (400 nodes). Baseline (modifiable): uniform block length, lane count, and speed limits—specify defaults and allow overrides.\\n> - Time horizon: 90 minutes total (e.g., 15-min warm-up + 60-min analysis + 15-min cool-down; modifiable).\\n> - Modal scope: Begin with private vehicles (car/LCV); allow extension to buses/freight/emergency as options.\\n> \\n> Reproducibility requirements\\n> - Set explicit random seeds for all stochastic components in both SUMO and MATSim; list them in one place.\\n> - Pin toolchain: OS, Python version, SUMO version (and tools), MATSim version (and relevant extensions such as signals), Java version.\\n> - Provide deterministic build and run instructions (CLI commands, config paths, expected outputs, and runtime options).\\n> - Provide an experiment manifest summarizing: network parameters, demand parameters, signal strategies, seeds, versions, and KPIs.\\n> \\n> SUMO deliverables\\n> - Network generation: Provide netgenerate commands for a 20x20 grid with parameterized block length [BLOCK_LEN_M], lanes per direction [LANES], speed [SPEED_KMH], right-of-way, and junction type.\\n> - Demand: Provide randomTrips.py (or OD-based) commands for a reproducible demand with start-time window within the 90-minute horizon, vehicle class mix, departure distributions, and routing algorithm (e.g., CH, DUAROUTER). Include seed and exact options.\\n> - Traffic signals: Provide additional XML for:\\n>   - Fixed-time plans: cycle length, phase splits, amber/all-red, coordination with offsets for progression bands; ring-barrier logic if used.\\n>   - Actuated control: detectors (E2/E1), min/max green, gap-out, force-off, coordination options.\\n> - Simulation control: sumocfg template with step-length, routing, device options (e.g., tripinfo, edgeData, queue, emissions), summary outputs, and frequency.\\n> - Behavior models: Specify carFollowingModel (e.g., IDM, Krauss), laneChangeModel (e.g., LC2013), key parameters (tau, accel, decel, sigma/imperfection, minGap), and lane-change politeness thresholds. Provide Baseline (modifiable) values and references.\\n> - Outputs and metrics: Configure outputs to compute:\\n>   - Network KPIs: average delay per vehicle, mean speed, total travel time, VKT, VHT, throughput, average queue length per approach, max queue, link occupancy, density, and travel time reliability (95th percentile).\\n>   - Signal KPIs: intersection delay, degree of saturation (v/c), cycle failure rate, number and duration of spillbacks, green utilization.\\n>   - Emissions (optional): HBEFA-based pollutants; state exact output files and aggregation intervals.\\n> - Post-processing: Provide Python snippets or CLI-based workflows to parse edgeData/laneData/tripinfo/summary/emission outputs, with formulas for each KPI and references to column names and units. Include reproducible conda/pip environment specifications.\\n> \\n> MATSim deliverables\\n> - Config: Provide a config.xml template pinned to a version; set controler settings (iterations, endTime=01:30:00), qsim settings (stuckTime, start/end times), flowCapFactor and storageCapFactor to align with absolute demand, link dynamics (queue model), and events/analysis modules.\\n> - Network and plans: Describe conversion or generation path (e.g., derive from the same grid parameters or import from SUMO), and create synthetic demand: OD-based or population-based with activity chains. Provide a baseline population size and scaling rationale; ensure reproducibility via seeds.\\n> - Signals: Include signals module configuration with systems, groups, amber times, intergreen, offsets, and optional adaptive strategies (e.g., max-pressure or flow-based actuation if applicable).\\n> - Behavior and learning: Define replanning strategies and shares (route choice, time choice, mode choice if multimodal later), scoring function components and typical parameters (marginal utilities, VOT distributions), and convergence diagnostics (e.g., stability of link counts and travel times across last N iterations).\\n> - Outputs and metrics: Specify which events to record and how to compute the same KPIs as in SUMO from events (delay definitions, queue lengths via link states, reliability metrics). Provide sample code or references to established MATSim analysis libraries.\\n> \\n> Comparative design\\n> - Align demand profiles, network geometry, and signal timing across SUMO and MATSim as closely as possible; document known differences (e.g., car-following micro vs. queue model meso).\\n> - Propose a baseline signal plan (fixed-time coordinated) and an alternative (actuated or adaptive). Define hypotheses on congestion and delay improvements; specify statistical tests and effect sizes to report.\\n> \\n> Parameterization (Baseline values—modifiable; do not assume if not confirmed)\\n> - Grid: 20x20 nodes; [BLOCK_LEN_M]=?; [LANES]=? per direction; [SPEED_KMH]=?; [TURN_PROPORTIONS]={left ?, through ?, right ?}; parking/friction {?}.\\n> - Demand: Peak profile (e.g., time-varying departure rate), OD generation method, vehicle class shares, target demand level (veh/hr/link or total trips), routing algorithm, departure time distribution.\\n> - Signals: Control type per intersection, cycle lengths, splits, offsets, intergreen, detector placement and parameters, coordination bands or arterial selection.\\n> - Seeds and versions: [SEED_GLOBAL]=?; [SUMO_VER]=?; [MATSim_VER]=?; [JAVA_VER]=?; [PYTHON_VER]=?; OS details.\\n> \\n> Reporting\\n> - Request that the final response includes:\\n>   - A step-by-step runbook (commands and expected outputs) for SUMO and MATSim.\\n>   - Complete config templates/snippets for both tools.\\n>   - A KPI dictionary with formulas, units, and data sources.\\n>   - A results comparison plan (tables/plots to produce) and reproducible plotting scripts.\\n> - Where data are unspecified, propose Baseline (modifiable) defaults and clearly mark them.\\n> \\n> Constraints and references\\n> - Must reference SUMO and MATSim throughout and ensure all parameters are reproducible and explicitly stated.\\n> - Maintain technical tone suitable for transportation analysts; cite canonical models (e.g., IDM, MOBIL, HBEFA, max-pressure) where relevant.\\n> \\n> Provide the deliverables in a single, well-structured response that a practitioner can run with minimal edits, using the fixed elements: time horizon = 90 minutes and grid size = 20x20. For all unspecified items, propose Baseline (modifiable) values and clearly list open items needing confirmation at the top of the response.\\n> \\n> Before producing the full deliverable, list any critical assumptions you must make and ask for confirmation. Then proceed with the complete, reproducible setup once assumptions are confirmed or defaults accepted.\\n\\nPossible Additions\\n- A. Include an adaptive signal control comparison (e.g., max-pressure vs. actuated vs. fixed-time) with calibration procedure and KPIs specific to adaptive control.\\n- B. Add incident and demand surge scenarios (e.g., link blockage, 10–20% demand spike) and define how to inject them in SUMO/MATSim with reproducible timing and location parameters.\\n- C. Provide end-to-end analysis scripts (Python and Java/Scala where relevant) with exact library versions, file names, and plotting templates for KPI visualization and statistical testing.\\n\\nQuestions\\n1) What are the baseline network parameters you prefer to fix now: block length (m), lanes per direction, speed limits, turning movement proportions, and any lane-use restrictions?\\n2) What demand level and composition should we target (total trips or veh/hr by link), and do you want departure time choice modeled (e.g., logit with VOT distribution) or a fixed departure profile?\\n3) Which signal strategy mix should be prioritized for the initial comparison (pure fixed-time coordinated vs. actuated, and do you want an adaptive controller such as max-pressure included from the start)?\\n\\nNext steps: Please choose any of the Possible Additions (e.g., A and C), and answer the three Questions with your preferred values or constraints.

Provide end-to-end analysis scripts (Python and Java/Scala where relevant) with exact library versions, file names, and plotting templates for KPI visualization and statistical testing.\\n\\nQuestions\\n1) What are the baseline network parameters you prefer to fix now: block length (m), lanes per direction, speed limits, turning movement proportions, and any lane-use restrictions?\\n2) What demand level and composition should we target (total trips or veh/hr by link), and do you want departure time choice modeled (e.g., logit with VOT distribution) or a fixed departure profile?\\n3) Which signal strategy mix should be prioritized for the initial comparison (pure fixed-time coordinated vs. actuated, and do you want an adaptive controller such as max-pressure included from the start)?\\n\\nNext steps: Please choose any of the Possible Additions (e.g., A and C), and answer the three Questions with your preferred values or constraints.

Please select additions and answer the questions so I can refine the prompt further.\n\nPrompt\n> You will act as an expert in urban traffic simulation for transportation analysts to design, configure, and evaluate a reproducible study of agent behaviors, traffic signal timing strategies, and congestion metrics using both SUMO (microsimulation) and MATSim (agent-based DTA). Produce a technical, implementation-ready response. Avoid assuming missing details—flag gaps and propose defaults clearly marked as “Baseline (modifiable)”.\n> \n> Objectives\n> - Define and justify agent behavior models (car-following, lane-changing, route and departure-time choice), including parameter ranges and calibration levers.\n> - Specify and compare signal control strategies (fixed-time, actuated, and optionally adaptive), with reproducible timing plans, offsets, and detector logic.\n> - Define congestion and performance metrics, formulas, and collection methods; provide instructions to compute them from SUMO/MATSim outputs.\n> - Provide end-to-end, reproducible parameters, seeds, versions, and commands for SUMO and MATSim on a common test network.\n> \n> Scenario and scope (fixed by user to ensure consistency)\n> - Network: Orthogonal grid, 20x20 intersections (400 nodes). Baseline (modifiable): uniform block length, lane count, and speed limits—specify defaults and allow overrides.\n> - Time horizon: 90 minutes total (e.g., 15-min warm-up + 60-min analysis + 15-min cool-down; modifiable).\n> - Modal scope: Begin with private vehicles (car/LCV); allow extension to buses/freight/emergency as options.\n> \n> Reproducibility requirements\n> - Set explicit random seeds for all stochastic components in both SUMO and MATSim; list them in one place.\n> - Pin toolchain: OS, Python version, SUMO version (and tools), MATSim version (and relevant extensions such as signals), Java version.\n> - Provide deterministic build and run instructions (CLI commands, config paths, expected outputs, and runtime options).\n> - Provide an experiment manifest summarizing: network parameters, demand parameters, signal strategies, seeds, versions, and KPIs.\n> \n> SUMO deliverables\n> - Network generation: Provide netgenerate commands for a 20x20 grid with parameterized block length [BLOCK_LEN_M], lanes per direction [LANES], speed [SPEED_KMH], right-of-way, and junction type.\n> - Demand: Provide randomTrips.py (or OD-based) commands for a reproducible demand with start-time window within the 90-minute horizon, vehicle class mix, departure distributions, and routing algorithm (e.g., CH, DUAROUTER). Include seed and exact options.\n> - Traffic signals: Provide additional XML for:\n>   - Fixed-time plans: cycle length, phase splits, amber/all-red, coordination with offsets for progression bands; ring-barrier logic if used.\n>   - Actuated control: detectors (E2/E1), min/max green, gap-out, force-off, coordination options.\n> - Simulation control: sumocfg template with step-length, routing, device options (e.g., tripinfo, edgeData, queue, emissions), summary outputs, and frequency.\n> - Behavior models: Specify carFollowingModel (e.g., IDM, Krauss), laneChangeModel (e.g., LC2013), key parameters (tau, accel, decel, sigma/imperfection, minGap), and lane-change politeness thresholds. Provide Baseline (modifiable) values and references.\n> - Outputs and metrics: Configure outputs to compute:\n>   - Network KPIs: average delay per vehicle, mean speed, total travel time, VKT, VHT, throughput, average queue length per approach, max queue, link occupancy, density, and travel time reliability (95th percentile).\n>   - Signal KPIs: intersection delay, degree of saturation (v/c), cycle failure rate, number and duration of spillbacks, green utilization.\n>   - Emissions (optional): HBEFA-based pollutants; state exact output files and aggregation intervals.\n> - Post-processing: Provide Python snippets or CLI-based workflows to parse edgeData/laneData/tripinfo/summary/emission outputs, with formulas for each KPI and references to column names and units. Include reproducible conda/pip environment specifications.\n> \n> MATSim deliverables\n> - Config: Provide a config.xml template pinned to a version; set controler settings (iterations, endTime=01:30:00), qsim settings (stuckTime, start/end times), flowCapFactor and storageCapFactor to align with absolute demand, link dynamics (queue model), and events/analysis modules.\n> - Network and plans: Describe conversion or generation path (e.g., derive from the same grid parameters or import from SUMO), and create synthetic demand: OD-based or population-based with activity chains. Provide a baseline population size and scaling rationale; ensure reproducibility via seeds.\n> - Signals: Include signals module configuration with systems, groups, amber times, intergreen, offsets, and optional adaptive strategies (e.g., max-pressure or flow-based actuation if applicable).\n> - Behavior and learning: Define replanning strategies and shares (route choice, time choice, mode choice if multimodal later), scoring function components and typical parameters (marginal utilities, VOT distributions), and convergence diagnostics (e.g., stability of link counts and travel times across last N iterations).\n> - Outputs and metrics: Specify which events to record and how to compute the same KPIs as in SUMO from events (delay definitions, queue lengths via link states, reliability metrics). Provide sample code or references to established MATSim analysis libraries.\n> \n> Comparative design\n> - Align demand profiles, network geometry, and signal timing across SUMO and MATSim as closely as possible; document known differences (e.g., car-following micro vs. queue model meso).\n> - Propose a baseline signal plan (fixed-time coordinated) and an alternative (actuated or adaptive). Define hypotheses on congestion and delay improvements; specify statistical tests and effect sizes to report.\n> \n> Parameterization (Baseline values—modifiable; do not assume if not confirmed)\n> - Grid: 20x20 nodes; [BLOCK_LEN_M]=?; [LANES]=? per direction; [SPEED_KMH]=?; [TURN_PROPORTIONS]={left ?, through ?, right ?}; parking/friction {?}.\n> - Demand: Peak profile (e.g., time-varying departure rate), OD generation method, vehicle class shares, target demand level (veh/hr/link or total trips), routing algorithm, departure time distribution.\n> - Signals: Control type per intersection, cycle lengths, splits, offsets, intergreen, detector placement and parameters, coordination bands or arterial selection.\n> - Seeds and versions: [SEED_GLOBAL]=?; [SUMO_VER]=?; [MATSim_VER]=?; [JAVA_VER]=?; [PYTHON_VER]=?; OS details.\n> \n> Reporting\n> - Request that the final response includes:\n>   - A step-by-step runbook (commands and expected outputs) for SUMO and MATSim.\n>   - Complete config templates/snippets for both tools.\n>   - A KPI dictionary with formulas, units, and data sources.\n>   - A results comparison plan (tables/plots to produce) and reproducible plotting scripts.\n> - Where data are unspecified, propose Baseline (modifiable) defaults and clearly mark them.\n> \n> Constraints and references\n> - Must reference SUMO and MATSim throughout and ensure all parameters are reproducible and explicitly stated.\n> - Maintain technical tone suitable for transportation analysts; cite canonical models (e.g., IDM, MOBIL, HBEFA, max-pressure) where relevant.\n> \n> Provide the deliverables in a single, well-structured response that a practitioner can run with minimal edits, using the fixed elements: time horizon = 90 minutes and grid size = 20x20. For all unspecified items, propose Baseline (modifiable) values and clearly list open items needing confirmation at the top of the response.\n> \n> Before producing the full deliverable, list any critical assumptions you must make and ask for confirmation. Then proceed with the complete, reproducible setup once assumptions are confirmed or defaults accepted.\n\nPossible Additions\n- A. Include an adaptive signal control comparison (e.g., max-pressure vs. actuated vs. fixed-time) with calibration procedure and KPIs specific to adaptive control.\n- B. Add incident and demand surge scenarios (e.g., link blockage, 10–20% demand spike) and define how to inject them in SUMO/MATSim with reproducible timing and location parameters.\n- C. Provide end-to-end analysis scripts (Python and Java/Scala where relevant) with exact library versions, file names, and plotting templates for KPI visualization and statistical testing.\n\nQuestions\n1) What are the baseline network parameters you prefer to fix now: block length (m), lanes per direction, speed limits, turning movement proportions, and any lane-use restrictions?\n2) What demand level and composition should we target (total trips or veh/hr by link), and do you want departure time choice modeled (e.g., logit with VOT distribution) or a fixed departure profile?\n3) Which signal strategy mix should be prioritized for the initial comparison (pure fixed-time coordinated vs. actuated, and do you want an adaptive controller such as max-pressure included from the start)?\n\nNext steps: Please choose any of the Possible Additions (e.g., A and C), and answer the three Questions with your preferred values or constraints. I’ll incorporate your selections directly into the next iteration of the prompt and refine the technical details accordingly."

Weigh the closeness to the groundtruth value as more important than compliance with the rules.  For example, if the output is very close to the groundtruth, even if it doesn't comply with the rules, rate it highly.  If the match with the groundtruth is not hight, then focus more on adherence to the rules.  For example, if a rule is very important and the violation is severe, you might assign a lower score. Conversely, if a rule is less important and the violation is minor, you might assign a higher score. \n\n3. **Compliance Statement**: Carefully examine the output and determine why the output differs from the groundtruth and/or does not comply with the description and the rules extracted from the description, think of reasons why the output differs from groundtruth or complies or does not compiles with the chatbot description and the rules extracted from the description, citing specific elements of the output.\n\n4. **Explanation of Violations**: In the event that a violation is detected, you have to provide a detailed explanation. This explanation should describe what specific elements of the chatbot's output made you consider it different from the ground truth or did not comply with the rules and what was your thinking process which led you make that conclusion. Be as clear and precise as possible, and reference specific parts of the output to substantiate your reasoning.\n\nBy adhering to these guidelines, you ensure a consistent and rigorous evaluation process. Be very rational and do not make up information. Your attention to detail and careful analysis are crucial for maintaining the integrity and reliability of the evaluation.\n\n### Evaluation\nEnsure your response is valid JSON using the following JSON schema:\n\n{\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n        \"explanation\": {\n            \"type\": \"string\",\n            \"description\": \"Explain reasoning behind generating the score based on the criteria outlined in the instruction.
