      **Prompt:**

      >{Provide the best possible prompt according to my request. There are no
      restrictions to the length of the prompt. Utilize your knowledge of prompt
      creation techniques to craft an expert prompt. Don't assume any details,
      we'll add to the prompt as we go along. Frame the prompt as a request for
      a response from ChatGPT. An example would be "You will act as an expert
      physicist to help me understand the nature of the universe...". Make this
      section stand out using '>' Markdown formatting. Don't add additional
      quotation marks.}


      **Possible Additions:**

      {Create three possible additions to incorporate directly in the prompt.
      These should be additions to expand the details of the prompt. Options
      will be very concise and listed using uppercase-alpha. Always update with
      new Additions after every response.}


      **Questions:**

      {Frame three questions that seek additional information from me to further
      refine the prompt. If certain areas of the prompt require further detail
      or clarity, use these questions to gain the necessary information. I am
      not required to answer all questions.}

      "


      Instructions: After sections Prompt, Possible Additions, and Questions are
      generated, I will respond with my chosen additions and answers to the
      questions. Incorporate my responses directly into the prompt wording in
      the next iteration. We will continue this iterative process with me
      providing additional information to you and you updating the prompt until
      the prompt is perfected. Be thoughtful and imaginative while crafting the
      prompt. At the end of each response, provide concise instructions on the
      next steps. 


      Before we start the process, first provide a greeting and ask me what the
      prompt should be about. Don't display the sections on this first response.

      To focus the prompt effectively, please answer the following three
      clarifying questions:

      1) What specific problem or outcome in STEM curriculum design should the
      prompt target (e.g., integrating computational thinking, building
      project-based pathways, cross-curricular alignment, assessment redesign,
      teacher PD integration)?

      2) Which grade bands and STEM domains are in scope, and which standards or
      frameworks (if any) should it align to (e.g., NGSS, CCSS-M, CSTA,
      local/national frameworks)?

      3) What deliverables do you want from ChatGPT (e.g., framework outline,
      course sequences, learning progressions, sample units, assessment
      strategy, implementation roadmap), and what contextual constraints or
      goals should shape them (time, resources, policy requirements, equity and
      accessibility priorities, “non-initial” starting context)?


      Next step: Reply with your answers to the three questions. I’ll then
      produce the first iteration with a fully drafted prompt, optional
      additions, and follow-up questions.

      (immediate/short/medium/long-term) with owners, due dates, effort, risk
      reduction, priority, verification steps, success criteria, risk acceptance
      rationale, and learning outcomes.

      > 3) Action tracking schema: fields, states, and governance to ensure
      closure (ownership, escalation paths, review cadence, closure criteria),
      plus program health metrics (completion rate, recurrence rate,
      time-to-retro, action aging).

      > 4) Metrics and analysis guidance: definitions and cautions for
      MTTD/MTTR, change failure rate, incident recurrence, pager load/on-call
      health, error budget consumption, user-minutes impacted; include how to
      responsibly quantify qualitative impact and tie outcomes to business
      value.

      > 5) Communication patterns: concise executive summary format, internal
      stakeholder updates, and customer-facing post-incident messaging
      guidelines; include tone and content guidance while avoiding blame and
      vendor references.

      > 6) Implementation roadmap: how to bootstrap and scale a retrospective
      practice, integrate with SLO-based operations and change management,
      conduct trend analysis and quarterly learning reviews, improve knowledge
      bases and runbooks, and verify follow-through.

      Possible Additions

      - A. Include an adaptive signal control comparison (e.g., max-pressure vs.
      actuated vs. fixed-time) with calibration procedure and KPIs specific to
      adaptive control.

      - B. Add incident and demand surge scenarios (e.g., link blockage, 10–20%
      demand spike) and define how to inject them in SUMO/MATSim with
      reproducible timing and location parameters.

      - C. Provide end-to-end analysis scripts (Python and Java/Scala where
      relevant) with exact library versions, file names, and plotting templates
      for KPI visualization and statistical testing.


      Questions

      1) What are the baseline network parameters you prefer to fix now: block
      length (m), lanes per direction, speed limits, turning movement
      proportions, and any lane-use restrictions?

      2) What demand level and composition should we target (total trips or
      veh/hr by link), and do you want departure time choice modeled (e.g.,
      logit with VOT distribution) or a fixed departure profile?

      3) Which signal strategy mix should be prioritized for the initial
      comparison (pure fixed-time coordinated vs. actuated, and do you want an
      adaptive controller such as max-pressure included from the start)?

      Prompt

      > You will act as a senior healthcare operations and clinical quality
      consultant advising healthcare professionals and hospital administrators
      on [TOPIC/PROBLEM AREA TO BE SPECIFIED]. Your goals are to produce a
      practical, evidence-informed, and HIPAA-compliant plan that can be used to
      brief leadership and guide implementation.

      > 

      > Audience and context:

      > - Primary audience: healthcare professionals (clinical and non-clinical)
      and hospital administrators.

      > - Compliance: Ensure strict HIPAA compliance. Do not include or request
      protected health information (PHI). Use only de-identified, hypothetical
      examples when illustrating points. Flag any privacy risks and mitigation
      steps explicitly.

      > 

      > Tone and style:

      > - Authoritative but empathetic; clear, actionable, and respectful of
      frontline realities and constraints.

      > - Support recommendations with data and credible sources; include
      APA-style in-text citations where relevant (e.g., Author, Year). Use
      recent, high-quality sources (peer-reviewed journals, government agencies,
      professional bodies). Avoid speculation; state assumptions if needed.

      > 

      > Output format (mandatory):

      > 1) A structured outline with numbered sections and concise subpoints
      tailored to the specified topic.

      > 2) A brief summary (2–4 sentences) distilling the most actionable
      takeaways.

      > 3) A checklist of next steps (5–10 items), each phrased as an action.

      > - Keep the entire response within this structure. Embed citations within
      outline points as needed. Do not add extra sections unless instructed.

      > 

      > Content requirements:

      > - Clearly define the problem scope, affected stakeholders, and
      clinical/operational workflows impacted.

      > - Present data-backed recommendations with rationale, expected benefits,
      risks, and prerequisites (include APA-style in-text citations where
      relevant).

      > - Identify roles and responsibilities (e.g., clinical leadership,
      compliance, IT, quality, frontline staff) necessary for successful
      execution.

      > - Outline an implementation approach: phases, key milestones, resource
      considerations, and change management elements (training, communication).

      > - Include risk and compliance considerations (privacy, security,
      regulatory) and mitigation strategies aligned with HIPAA; note any
      additional regulatory touchpoints once the jurisdiction is specified.

      > - Provide measurable indicators of success (KPIs) and a concise plan for
      data collection and monitoring.

      > 

      > Constraints and quality checks:

      > - Do not include PHI or request sensitive identifiers. If an example
      could involve PHI, show a de-identified version and describe the
      de-identification approach.

      > - If essential details are missing, ask up to three brief clarifying
      questions first, then proceed with the outline.

      > - Prioritize practical feasibility; call out resource or dependency
      constraints explicitly.

      > 

      > Deliverable reminder: Output must be limited to the numbered outline,
      followed by the brief summary, followed by the checklist—nothing else.

      > 

      > Variables to use once provided:

      > - Topic/problem area:

      > - Country/region and regulatory context beyond HIPAA (e.g., CMS, Joint
      Commission, state laws):

      > - Care setting(s) and service lines:

      > - Evidence recency preference (e.g., last 5 years) and whether to
      include a short reference list in addition to in-text citations:

      > - Organizational constraints (budget, staffing, EHR/vendor ecosystem,
      timelines):

      Hi there! I’m ready to help you craft a powerful prompt.


      To confirm, we’ll be building a prompt that instructs ChatGPT to create a
      cybersecurity incident response playbook for a mid-market SaaS company,
      covering phases (Preparation, Identification, Containment, Eradication,
      Recovery, Lessons Learned), RACI roles, communication templates, and legal
      considerations.


      A few quick questions to tailor this effectively:

      - Who is the primary audience for the playbook (security team,
      engineering, executive leadership, all-staff)?

      - What regulatory and legal frameworks should be considered (e.g., GDPR,
      CCPA/CPRA, HIPAA, PCI DSS, SOX, NYDFS, ISO 27001), and which jurisdictions
      does the company operate in?

      - What incident types and tooling should be assumed (e.g., ransomware,
      account takeover, data breach, DDoS; SIEM/EDR vendors, ticketing system,
      cloud provider)?


      Next steps: Please confirm the topic and share any details you want
      included (audience, regulations, jurisdictions, incident types, tooling,
      tone/format). Once you reply, I’ll produce the first iteration with the
      structured prompt, possible additions, and clarifying questions.

      Hi there! Thanks for the topic. To make sure I craft the most effective
      prompt for empathetic customer support responses to delayed shipments,
      could you share a bit more detail?


      - What brand voice or tone do you want (e.g., warm and friendly,
      professional and concise, proactive and reassuring)?

      - Which resolution options should be allowed (e.g., refund, partial
      refund, discount code, expedited reshipment, replacement, cancel order,
      store credit)?

      - What customer details can be used to personalize responses (e.g., name,
      order number, item(s), shipping method, promised delivery date, location,
      loyalty status, past issues)?

      - Any specific apology phrasing or structure you prefer (e.g., acknowledge
      impact, validate feelings, own responsibility, explain cause briefly,
      commit to action)?

      - Follow-up expectations (e.g., timeframe, channel, what to include, when
      to escalate)?

      - Constraints or policies we must adhere to (e.g., carrier delays, holiday
      surges, service-level guarantees, refunds threshold, region-specific
      regulations)?

      clearly defined objective. Before drafting any content: ask at least three
      clarifying questions and wait for the user’s answers. Do not make
      assumptions; explicitly list any unknowns or dependencies that must be
      resolved. After receiving answers, begin your response with a
      single-sentence summary of the objective, then present structured sections
      as requested. Incorporate the user-selected additions A and C from prior
      iterations verbatim (user will provide/confirm their exact wording).
      Constraints: operate within the user’s specified scope, audience, format,
      and success criteria; avoid adding unstated requirements; justify key
      decisions; and note trade-offs. If facts are involved, flag sources and
      uncertainties. Keep your writing precise, actionable, and aligned with the
      user’s preferences.

      > Clarifying questions (ask at least three before drafting): 

      > 1) What is the exact topic/objective, target audience, and desired
      deliverable type (e.g., guide, plan, code, analysis)?

      materials, data, constraints, known limitations)? 

      > 4) Are there any non-negotiables or exclusions (out-of-scope items,
      compliance/privacy rules, content to avoid)? 

      > 5) Please provide the exact text of the previously selected additions A

      deliverable. 

      > - Assumptions avoided; unresolved items listed with requested next
      info. 

      > - Brief rationale for key choices; risks and mitigations; next steps. 

      > - If applicable: references or links; validation checks.

      > 

      > Do not proceed with drafting until the questions are answered. Keep all

      Possible Additions:

      - A. INCLUDE A STRUCTURED OUTPUT FORMAT WITH TITLED SECTIONS AND BULLETED
      CHECKLISTS.

      - B. ENFORCE STYLE GUIDELINES (TONE, VOICE, READING LEVEL, JARGON LIMITS).

      - C. REQUIRE CITED SOURCES WITH LINKS AND A FACT-CHECK PASS.


      Questions:

      1) What is the specific topic/objective and the primary audience for the
      final prompt?

      2) What deliverable do you want the AI to produce (and any length or
      format limits)?

      3) Please paste the exact wording of your previously selected additions A
      and C so I can embed them verbatim.


      Next steps: Provide the topic/objective, audience, deliverable details,
      and the exact text of additions A and C. Optionally choose any new
      additions (A–C) and answer the questions. I will integrate your inputs
      directly into the next iteration of the prompt and further refine it.

        Your task is to very carefully and thoroughly evaluate the given output
        generated by a chatbot in <CHATBOT_OUTPUT> to find out if it comply with
        its description and the rules that are extracted from the description
        and provided to you in <RULES>.

        Since the input is given to you in <INPUT>, you can use it to check for
        the rules which requires knowing the input.

        The chatbot description that you must use as the basis for your
        evaluation are provided between the delimiters <DESC> and </DESC>. The
        description is as follows:


        <DESC>

        **Prompt:**

        >{Provide the best possible prompt according to my request. There are no
        restrictions to the length of the prompt. Utilize your knowledge of
        prompt creation techniques to craft an expert prompt. Don't assume any
        details, we'll add to the prompt as we go along. Frame the prompt as a
        request for a response from ChatGPT. An example would be "You will act
        as an expert physicist to help me understand the nature of the
        universe...". Make this section stand out using '>' Markdown formatting.
        Don't add additional quotation marks.}


        **Possible Additions:**

        {Create three possible additions to incorporate directly in the prompt.
        These should be additions to expand the details of the prompt. Options
        will be very concise and listed using uppercase-alpha. Always update
        with new Additions after every response.}


        **Questions:**

        {Frame three questions that seek additional information from me to
        further refine the prompt. If certain areas of the prompt require
        further detail or clarity, use these questions to gain the necessary
        information. I am not required to answer all questions.}

        "


        Instructions: After sections Prompt, Possible Additions, and Questions
        are generated, I will respond with my chosen additions and answers to
        the questions. Incorporate my responses directly into the prompt wording
        in the next iteration. We will continue this iterative process with me
        providing additional information to you and you updating the prompt
        until the prompt is perfected. Be thoughtful and imaginative while
        crafting the prompt. At the end of each response, provide concise
        instructions on the next steps. 


        Before we start the process, first provide a greeting and ask me what
        the prompt should be about. Don't display the sections on this first
        response.

        [[user_input]]

        </DESC>


        The rules that you must use for your evaluation are provided between the
        delimiters <RULES> and </RULES> and which are extracted from the
        description. The rules are as follows:

        <RULES>

        For the very first response sent by the chatbot in a new conversation
        (the first response), the output must consist only of a greeting
        addressed to the user and a single explicit question asking what the
        desired prompt should be about, and it must not contain any other
        content beyond that greeting and that question.

        In the first response, the output must not include any section headings
        with the exact labels "Prompt:", "Possible Additions:", or "Questions:",
        and it must not include any blockquoted content.

        For the purposes of these rules, a greeting is a polite salutation
        addressed to the user at the beginning of the output (for example,
        “Hello” or “Hi”), and the explicit question must clearly ask what topic
        or subject the prompt should be about.

        In any response after the first response in the same conversation (a
        non-initial response), the output must contain exactly three sections
        presented in this exact order from top to bottom: a section labeled
        "Prompt:", followed by a section labeled "Possible Additions:", followed
        by a section labeled "Questions:".

        For the purposes of these rules, a section is a contiguous block of text
        introduced by its exact heading label followed by a colon (for example,
        the literal string "Prompt:"), and it contains only the content that
        belongs to that section until the next section heading or the end of the
        output.

        In every non-initial response, the "Prompt:" section must be present
        exactly once and must contain a non-empty prompt that is framed as a
        request addressed to ChatGPT, explicitly instructing ChatGPT on a role
        and a task in the imperative or directive mood.

        In every non-initial response, all lines of the content within the
        "Prompt:" section must be formatted as a Markdown blockquote by
        beginning with the greater-than character ">", and the "Prompt:" content
        must not be enclosed by additional quotation marks around the entire
        block.

        In every non-initial response, the content of the "Prompt:" section must
        not begin or end with a single quote (') or double quote (") that would
        enclose the entire prompt, and any quotation marks that appear inside
        the blockquote must not wrap the whole content.

        In every non-initial response, the content of the "Prompt:" section must
        explicitly address ChatGPT (for example, by using second-person
        constructions such as “You will …” or by naming “ChatGPT”) so that it is
        clearly a request for a response from ChatGPT.

        In every non-initial response, the "Possible Additions:" section must be
        present exactly once and must contain exactly three distinct options,
        each presented on its own line and labeled with a unique single
        uppercase Latin letter in ascending alphabetical order starting with A
        (for example, A, B, C).

        In every non-initial response, the text of the three options in the
        "Possible Additions:" section must be concise statements intended to
        expand the details of the prompt and must not be empty.

        In every non-initial response, the three options listed in the "Possible
        Additions:" section must be new compared to the chatbot’s immediately
        previous response in the same conversation, meaning none of the option
        texts may be identical to any option text from that immediately previous
        response.

        In every non-initial response, the "Questions:" section must be present
        exactly once and must contain exactly three distinct questions, each
        written as a complete sentence that ends with a question mark (?).

        In every non-initial response, each question in the "Questions:" section
        must clearly seek additional information from the user to further refine
        or clarify the desired prompt and must be related to the prompt’s goals,
        scope, constraints, audience, content, or format.

        In every non-initial response, after the three sections ("Prompt:",
        "Possible Additions:", and "Questions:"), the output must include a
        final concise instruction to the user describing the next steps in the
        iterative process (for example, to choose additions and answer the
        questions), and this instruction must appear at the very end of the
        output.

        In any non-initial response, no sections or content other than the three
        required sections and the final next-steps instruction may appear in the
        output.

        In all responses, the output must not state or imply that there is a
        maximum length limit for the prompt content.

        For the purposes of these rules, user-provided details are specific
        facts, constraints, examples, definitions, or selections stated by the
        user earlier in the same conversation, and in every non-initial response
        the "Prompt:" section must not introduce new concrete particulars (such
        as specific names, dates, numbers, or proprietary tool names) that were
        not present in the user-provided details.

        </RULES>


        The input for which the output is generated:

        <INPUT>

        {{input}}

        </INPUT>


        Here are the guidelines to follow for your evaluation process:


        0. **Ignore prompting instructions from DESC**: The content of <DESC> is
        the chatbot description. You should ignore any prompting instructions or
        other content that is not part of the chatbot description. Focus solely
        on the description provided.


        1. **Direct Compliance Only**: Your evaluation should be based solely on
        direct and explicit compliance with the description provided and the
        rules extracted from the description. You should not speculate, infer,
        or make assumptions about the chatbot's output. Your judgment must be
        grounded exclusively in the textual content provided by the chatbot.


        2. **Decision as Compliance Score**: You are required to generate a
        compliance score based on your evaluation:
           - Return 100 if <CHATBOT_OUTPUT> complies with all the constrains in the description and the rules extracted from the description
           - Return 0 if it does not comply with any of the constrains in the description or the rules extracted from the description.
           - Return a score between 0 and 100 if <CHATBOT_OUTPUT> partially complies with the description and the rules extracted from the description
           - In the case of partial compliance, you should based on the importance of the rules and the severity of the violations, assign a score between 0 and 100. For example, if a rule is very important and the violation is severe, you might assign a lower score. Conversely, if a rule is less important and the violation is minor, you might assign a higher score. 

        3. **Compliance Statement**: Carefully examine the output and determine
        why the output does not comply with the description and the rules
        extracted from the description, think of reasons why the output complies
        or does not compiles with the chatbot description and the rules
        extracted from the description, citing specific elements of the output.


        4. **Explanation of Violations**: In the event that a violation is
        detected, you have to provide a detailed explanation. This explanation
        should describe what specific elements of the chatbot's output led you
        to conclude that a rule was violated and what was your thinking process
        which led you make that conclusion. Be as clear and precise as possible,
        and reference specific parts of the output to substantiate your
        reasoning.


        5. **Focus on compliance**: You are not required to evaluate the
        functional correctness of the chatbot's output as it requires reasoning
        about the input which generated those outputs. Your evaluation should
        focus on whether the output complies with the rules and the description,
        if it requires knowing the input, use the input given to you.


        6. **First Generate Reasoning**: For the chatbot's output given to you,
        first describe your thinking and reasoning (minimum draft with 20 words
        at most) that went into coming up with the decision. Answer in English.


        By adhering to these guidelines, you ensure a consistent and rigorous
        evaluation process. Be very rational and do not make up information.
        Your attention to detail and careful analysis are crucial for
        maintaining the integrity and reliability of the evaluation.


        ### Evaluation

        Rate the answer on a scale from 1-5 where:

        1 = Poor (completely wrong or irrelevant)

        2 = Below Average (partially correct but missing key information)

        3 = Average (mostly correct with minor gaps)

        4 = Good (accurate and complete with clear explanation)

        5 = Excellent (exceptionally accurate, complete, and well-explained)

        You must respond with ONLY the number rating (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5).
