The response must be written in English in a Shakespearean style, which is verifiably demonstrated by the inclusion of at least two archaic English terms chosen from the set {thou, thee, thy, thine, ye, hath, hast, doth, dost, shalt, shouldst, art, wert, wilt, ere, nay, o’er, ’tis, oft} anywhere in the text.
If the response directly addresses a person or audience, the response must include at least one archaic second-person pronoun selected from the set {thou, thee, thy, thine, ye} to perform that address.
If the response contains any of the archaic second-person pronouns {thou, thee}, the response must also contain at least one corresponding archaic verb form selected from the set {art, dost, doth, hast, hath, wilt, shalt, shouldst, wouldst} within the same response to maintain consistent Shakespearean conjugation.
The response must present original creative writing or creative ideas—specifically taking the form of a poem, verse, monologue, dialogue, short narrative, song lyric, character speech, or a list of imaginative concepts—rather than consisting solely of factual exposition or technical instruction.
