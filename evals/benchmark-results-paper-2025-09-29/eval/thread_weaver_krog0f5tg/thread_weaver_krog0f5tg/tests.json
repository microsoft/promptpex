Source: “Deep Work in a Distracted World.” #Productivity #Focus\n\n2/7\nPrinciples (00:00 Focus myth): Focus isn’t an innate gift; it’s a skill you schedule and protect. Guard attention, limit context switching, work in defined blocks, and allow real rest. Treat deep work like a meeting with yourself.\n\n3/7\nHabits: (1) Time blocking — Map your day in blocks and reserve deep work sessions when energy is highest. (2) Single-tasking — One task, one tab. Mute alerts and remove visual clutter. [Image] Alt: Calendar with color-coded deep work, admin, and break blocks.\n\n4/7\nHabits: (3) Shutdown ritual — Review the day, plan tomorrow, and use a cue to switch off. (4) Reduce notifications — Disable non-essential alerts and schedule specific check-in times. [Image] Alt: Phone/desktop settings screen with notification toggles off.\n\n5/7\nHabits: (5) Batching communication (05:32) — Handle email/DMs in focused batches, not continuously. (6) Clear goals — Define a few Most Important Tasks and what “done” looks like. #Productivity\n\n6/7\nHabit: (7) Weekly review (12:10) — Reflect on wins, misses, and priorities; reset your blocks; prune tasks. Tools: Plan in @NotionHQ and track tasks in @todoist (or your favorites). [Image] Alt: Simple weekly review checklist with reflect, plan, prioritize.\n\n7/7\nWhich habit trips you up most? Vote below. Options: Time blocking, Single-tasking, Notifications, Weekly review. Want this as a single, shareable post?

Here’s the breakdown and why it matters for builders and users alike. Source: https://blog.google/technology/ai/responsible-ai-principles/ #ResponsibleAI\n[Image ALT: Balanced scale over a circuit pattern, symbolizing ethics guiding technology]\n\n2/10\nPrinciple 1: Be socially beneficial. AI should advance social good—think accessibility, health, safety, education, and environmental sustainability—while weighing potential benefits against risks to people and society. #AI #ResponsibleAI\n[Image ALT: A globe with interconnected people icons showing AI’s societal reach]\n\n3/10\nPrinciple 2: Avoid creating or reinforcing unfair bias. Systems should be designed and evaluated to promote equitable outcomes, with attention to how data is collected, labeled, and tested across different user groups. #AI #ResponsibleAI\n\n4/10\nPrinciple 3: Built and tested for safety. Before and after deployment, AI systems undergo rigorous testing, risk assessment, and ongoing monitoring to identify vulnerabilities and reduce the chance of harmful failures. #AI #ResponsibleAI\n\n5/10\nPrinciple 4: Accountable to people. Humans remain in the loop. Clear controls, feedback channels, and avenues for redress help ensure AI systems are answerable to users, developers, and impacted communities. #AI #ResponsibleAI\n\n6/10\nPrinciple 5: Incorporate privacy by design. Responsible AI respects user data through strong security, data minimization, and product design choices that protect privacy across the entire system lifecycle. #AI #ResponsibleAI\n\n7/10\nPrinciple 6: Uphold high standards of scientific excellence. Building reliable #AI means rigorous research practices, careful evaluation, and transparency where appropriate so results are meaningful and reproducible. #ResponsibleAI\n\n8/10\nPrinciple 7: Be available for uses that align with these principles—and not for those that violate them. Google highlights areas they won’t pursue, like weapons, technologies likely to cause overall harm, or surveillance that contravenes accepted norms or human rights. #AI #ResponsibleAI\n\n9/10\nPutting principles into practice: internal reviews, testing, documentation, and stakeholder engagement help operationalize these commitments. Question for you: Which principle is most critical right now—Bias, Safety, Privacy, or Accountability? (Consider as a poll.) #AI #ResponsibleAI\n\n10/10\nBottom line: Responsible AI is a continuous commitment—benefit society, reduce harm, protect people, and stay accountable.

Let’s break down the key risks and practical responses that keep communities, code, and contributors thriving. #OpenSource #DevOps\n\n2/9\nCore challenges:\n- Maintainer burnout\n- Security risks across dependencies\n- Funding gaps for critical upkeep\nPoll idea: Which is the hardest to solve in your experience—Burnout, Security, or Funding? Vote below to compare perspectives.\n\n3/9\nFunding Models\nDiversified funding beats one-off donations. Blend individual and corporate support, grants, and services/paid support to stabilize roadmaps and reduce single-sponsor risk.\nImage suggestion: Simple bar chart showing a balanced mix of funding streams.\nAlt text: “Bar chart illustrating diversified funding sources contributing to a project.”\n\n4/9\nCorporate Stewardship\nCompanies benefit from open source—so sustained stewardship matters. Commit engineering time, budget, and long-term support. Encourage employees to contribute during work hours and back critical infra. cc @LinuxFoundation\n\n5/9\nTransparent Governance\nClarity prevents friction. Publish decision-making processes, roles, release policies, and conflict-resolution steps. Document how maintainers are selected, how votes are held, and how changes are proposed and approved.\n\n6/9\nCommunity Health\nOnboarding is your growth engine. Offer clear contribution guides, “good first issues,” and responsive reviews. Recognize contributors, spread load across multiple maintainers, and rotate duties to protect against burnout.\nImage suggestion: Onboarding flow diagram (discover → docs → first PR → review → recognition).\nAlt text: “Flow diagram mapping a contributor’s path from discovery to recognized contributor.”\n\n7/9\nSecurity Practices\nTreat security as continuous work, not a one-off sprint. Prioritize timely patching, routine dependency updates, and clear incident response steps. Communicate advisories and fixes quickly and transparently.\n\n8/9\nHealth Metrics\nTrack what matters: issue/PR response times, release cadence, maintainer load, and basic funding runway. Metrics make risks visible and help justify funding requests and roadmap decisions.\nImage suggestion: Lightweight dashboard mock-up with response time and maintainer load indicators.\nAlt text: “Minimal dashboard showing average PR response time and open maintainer workload.”\n\n9/9\nSustainability is a team sport. Support maintainers, invest in security, and bake governance and metrics into your process. If you influence budgets or roadmaps, champion resilient models.

Balanced view ahead. #GovTech #Blockchain @ethereum @Hyperledger\n\n2/9\nLand registries\n- What it offers: tamper-evident property records, faster verification, reduced disputes.\n- What to watch: legal alignment with existing cadastre systems, data accuracy off-chain, and privacy of ownership details.\nSuggested visual: Map + ledger overlay\nAlt text: A parcel map with a subtle blockchain ledger motif indicating secure record entries.\n\n3/9\nDigital identity\n- What it offers: verifiable credentials for citizens, fewer silos across agencies, stronger auditability.\n- What to watch: privacy by design, key recovery and inclusion (not everyone can manage keys), and policy compliance.\nSuggested visual: ID card icon with a verified check\nAlt text: A digital ID card with a check mark symbolizing verified credentials.\n\n4/9\nProcurement transparency\n- What it offers: timestamped bids, transparent awards, standardized records to deter corruption.\n- What to watch: confidentiality of bids before deadlines and clear rules for who can write/update records.\nSuggested visual: Timeline of bids\nAlt text: A simple timeline showing sealed bids being recorded with timestamps.\n\n5/9\nAudit trails\n- What it offers: immutable, time-ordered logs of actions for oversight and accountability.\n- What to watch: role-based permissions, retention rules, and ensuring logs don’t expose sensitive information.\nSuggested visual: Chain of events diagram\nAlt text: A sequential chain of blocks labeled as steps in a public service process.\n\n6/9\nRisk: Scalability\n- Throughput and latency must meet real workloads (nationwide registries, ID checks, procurement cycles).\n- Plan for capacity, resilience, and cost under peak demand before moving beyond pilots.\n#GovTech #Blockchain\n\n7/9\nRisk: Governance\n- Who can write, validate, and change rules?\n- How are upgrades, disputes, and oversight handled?\n- Clear governance charters are as important as the tech itself.\nMentions: @ethereum @Hyperledger\n\n8/9\nRisk: Privacy\n- Sensitive citizen data must be protected.\n- Favor minimal on-chain data and strong access controls.\n- Balance transparency with confidentiality requirements.\n\n9/9\nBottom line\n- Useful fits: land records, identity credentials, procurement logging, audit trails—when risks are managed.\n- Start with targeted pilots, policy alignment, and measurable outcomes.\nPoll idea: Which area should be prioritized first? Land registries / Digital ID / Procurement / Audit trails\n\nUnroll option\nAs requested, here’s an unrolled version you can share as a single post:\n\nBlockchain in the public sector shows promise in land registries, digital identity, procurement transparency, and audit trails, but it must address scalability, governance, and privacy. Land registries can reduce disputes with tamper-evident records, provided privacy and legal alignment are respected. Digital identity can streamline services with verifiable credentials, but inclusion, key recovery, and privacy-by-design are essential. Procurement benefits from timestamped, standardized records, though confidentiality before deadlines and write permissions must be defined. Audit trails improve oversight, yet they require clear roles, retention policies, and privacy controls. Scalability demands planning for throughput, latency, resilience, and cost beyond pilots. Governance must define who writes, validates, upgrades, and resolves disputes. Privacy requires minimal on-chain data and strong access controls. The bottom line: target well-scoped use cases, align policies, pilot carefully, and measure outcomes.\n\nWant a custom thumbnail for this thread?

I’ve kept it to 8 tweets with clear flow, visuals suggestions, and a poll.\n\n1/8\nThe energy transition hinges on how well we store renewables. Three innovations are shaping tomorrow’s grid: long‑duration energy storage (LDES), grid‑scale batteries, and thermal storage. #EnergyStorage #Renewables @ENERGY @BloombergNEF\nMedia suggestion: Simple infographic showing solar/wind feeding three storage icons (LDES, batteries, thermal).\nAlt text: A clean grid diagram with arrows from wind/solar to three labeled storage types: long-duration, grid batteries, thermal.\n\n2/8\nWhy storage matters: it matches variable wind/solar with demand, boosts reliability, and cuts curtailment. LDES provides many hours to days of discharge—key for deep decarbonization (U.S. DOE: https://www.energy.gov/policy/articles/long-duration-energy-storage). #EnergyStorage\n\n3/8\nLDES is a technology family—mechanical, chemical, electrochemical, and thermal—focused on long discharge duration and system services (U.S. DOE: https://www.energy.gov/policy/articles/long-duration-energy-storage). It complements short-duration batteries to firm renewables.\nMedia suggestion: Illustration comparing duration ranges (minutes/hours vs multi‑hour/days).\nAlt text: Horizontal bars showing short-duration batteries (0.5–4h) and LDES (8h+ to multi‑day).\n\n4/8\nGrid‑scale batteries (today, largely lithium‑ion) are the workhorses scaling fast. Battery pack costs hit new lows in 2024, improving project economics and competitiveness across markets (BloombergNEF: https://about.bnef.com/blog/battery-pack-costs-2024/). @BloombergNEF #Renewables\n\n5/8\nWhat falling costs enable: energy arbitrage, frequency regulation, peak shaving, and higher renewable penetration—often deferring some grid upgrades (BloombergNEF: https://about.bnef.com/blog/battery-pack-costs-2024/; U.S. DOE LDES: https://www.energy.gov/policy/articles/long-duration-energy-storage). #EnergyStorage\n\n6/8\nThermal energy storage is a quietly powerful option: storing heat/cold in low‑cost media (e.g., molten salts, rocks, water, PCMs) to decarbonize industrial heat, district energy, and pair with CSP or electric boilers (U.S. DOE: https://www.energy.gov/policy/articles/long-duration-energy-storage).\nMedia suggestion: Cross‑section graphic of a thermal tank with hot/cold zones.\nAlt text: Cutaway of an insulated tank showing stored heat on one side and cooler zone on the other, with charge/discharge arrows.\n\n7/8\nPolicy and market design matter: value duration and flexibility, streamline interconnection, and enable revenue stacking to unlock LDES and batteries (U.S. DOE: https://www.energy.gov/policy/articles/long-duration-energy-storage). @ENERGY\nPoll: Which will have the biggest impact by 2030?\n- LDES\n- Grid‑scale batteries\n- Thermal storage\n- A mix\n\n8/8\nRecap: LDES firms renewables over long horizons, grid‑scale batteries scale quickly as costs fall, and thermal storage decarbonizes heat while supporting the grid. Together, they accelerate net‑zero pathways (U.S. DOE, BloombergNEF sources above). Want an unrolled, single‑post version?\n\nWould you like a custom thumbnail for this thread?

    "groundtruth": "Here’s your semi-formal, balanced Twitter thread based on the provided source text.\n\n1/9\nSolar net metering is evolving. Utilities are proposing lower export credits, regulators are weighing time-of-use (TOU) structures, and stakeholders are elevating equity concerns—especially for renters. Community solar pilots are emerging to broaden access. #Solar #NetMetering @NARUC @ENERGY\n\nSuggested visual: Bar chart comparing current retail-rate credits vs. proposed export credits.\nAlt text: “Side-by-side bars showing current net metering credit at or near retail versus lower, avoided-cost-style export credits.”\n\n2/9\nWhy lower credits? Utilities argue retail-rate compensation can overpay exports relative to system value, raising cost-shift concerns. Lower, value-based credits could lengthen rooftop solar payback periods unless program design includes a gradual transition. #EnergyPolicy #RateDesign\n\nSuggested visual: Timeline graphic showing a “glide path” reduction in credits.\nAlt text: “Line graph with a step-down trajectory in net metering export credits over several years.”\n\n3/9\nCustomer response: more interest in storage. Batteries enable self-consumption and shifting exports to higher-value periods under TOU. Economics hinge on battery incentives, TOU spreads, and interconnection rules. #EnergyStorage #TimeOfUse @ENERGY\n\nSuggested visual: Battery charge/discharge curve aligned with TOU price windows.\nAlt text: “Daily profile showing battery charging midday and discharging during evening peak.”\n\n4/9\nRegulators are exploring TOU-aligned export credits to better reflect grid value. Key design choices: simplicity vs. precision, seasonal tiers, and predictable returns for customers and installers. Clarity and stability matter for investment. #TOU #Regulatory @NARUC\n\nSuggested visual: Heatmap of hourly export values (weekday/weekend).\nAlt text: “Color grid showing lower midday compensation and higher evening peak values.”\n\n5/9\nEquity considerations are central. Renters and many low-income households lack access to rooftops, risking uneven benefits. Tools include on-bill credits, virtual net metering, and dedicated low-income carve-outs to share value more fairly. #EnergyEquity #Renters @VoteSolar\n\nSuggested visual: Illustration of multi-family building with shared credits.\nAlt text: “Apartment building with arrows pointing to electric bills receiving shared solar credits.”\n\n6/9\nCommunity solar pilots are expanding access. Subscribers receive bill credits from offsite arrays, with potential adders for low-income participation. Strong consumer protections and portability help ensure durable benefits. #CommunitySolar @SEIA @VoteSolar\n\nSuggested visual: Diagram of a shared solar farm with multiple subscribers.\nAlt text: “Community solar array connected to the grid with lines to diverse subscribers’ meters.”\n\n7/9\nPoll: Which reform would most improve fairness and grid value?\n- TOU-aligned export credits\n- Storage incentives for self-consumption\n- Expanding community solar\n- Keep current net metering\nVote below and share your state experience. #Solar #EnergyPolicy\n\n8/9\nWhat to watch in rulemakings: grandfathering timelines, glide paths for credit changes, storage interconnection standards, consumer protections, and how “grid value” is measured. Public comments and stakeholder engagement shape outcomes. @NARUC #CleanEnergy\n\n9/9\nBottom line: Net metering is shifting toward value-reflective compensation, with storage and community solar playing bigger roles. Equity must be integral so renters and low-income households share in the transition’s benefits. #Solar #CommunitySolar #EnergyEquity\n\nCitations and notes: This thread is based solely on the user-provided article summary.

    "groundtruth": "Thread: Nutrition, simplified — 6 levers that shape your day-to-day 👇 [1]\n\n1) Big picture\nNutrition isn’t one thing—it’s a system. Macros guide energy balance, fiber helps keep you full, fasting can be a tool, hydration supports thinking, sleep affects cravings, and culture keeps plans sustainable. Fast tour ahead. [1]\n\n2) Macros steer energy balance\nProtein, carbs, and fats provide calories. Matching intake to needs guides weight change; ratios can vary by person. Practical aim: protein at each meal, carbs around activity, and fats for flavor/satiety. [1]\n- Suggested image: A balanced plate divided into protein, carbs, and fats\n- Alt text: Overhead plate with three portions—protein, carbohydrate, and fat—illustrating balanced meal components\n\n3) Fiber = fullness ally 🥗\nFiber adds volume, slows digestion, and steadies appetite. Anchor meals with veggies, legumes, whole grains, and fruit skins. Easy wins: oats for breakfast, beans in salads, berries for dessert. [1]\n\n4) Intermittent fasting (IF), carefully ⏰\nIF may improve insulin sensitivity for some people—but it’s a tool, not a cure-all. If you try it: keep nutrient quality high, don’t underfuel, and choose a schedule that fits your life. Sustainability first. [1]\n\n5) Hydration powers cognition 💧\nEven mild dehydration can dent focus and mood. Keep water visible, sip steadily, and consider electrolytes when sweating or in heat. Simple rule: drink regularly across the day. [1]\n- Suggested image: Clear water bottle on a desk beside a notebook\n- Alt text: Transparent bottle half-filled with water next to an open notebook and pen on a well-lit desk\n\n6) Sleep shapes cravings 😴\nShort or poor sleep pushes appetite toward quick-energy foods. Guard a wind-down routine, consistent sleep/wake times, and a cool, dark room. Better sleep → better choices. [1]\n\n7) Culture drives adherence 🍚\nCultural food traditions help you stick with a plan. Adapt recipes, keep family meals, and build portions around familiar staples—comfort and consistency beat perfection. What tradition keeps you on track? [1]\n\n8) TL;DR\nBalance macros, lean on fiber, consider IF if it suits you, drink water, prioritize sleep, and keep culture at the center. Small, consistent steps win long-term. Which lever will you focus on this week? #Nutrition #Health [1]\n\nFootnotes:\n[1] Nutrition explainer (user-provided)\n\nWant this unrolled into a single, shareable post? I can do that—just say “unroll.”\n\nWould you like a custom thread thumbnail? I can draft 2 visual concepts (no text, default Pixar-style) with alt-text suggestions. If you’re interested, say “thumbnail please.”\n\nFeedback and extras:\n- Follow and share feedback with Davide (plugin developer) on X: https://twitter.com/web3Dav3\n- Try our other GPT, AlphaNotes, to generate summaries and study notes from videos and articles"

    "groundtruth": "Here’s a slow-paced macroeconomics primer thread based on your source text. Tone: formal. Emojis: off. Hashtags: minimal. Mentions: none. Polls: none. Scholarly citations: available upon request.\n\n1/9\nThis thread outlines core macro concepts: GDP components, output gaps, Phillips curve debates, monetary policy transmission via interest rates, state-dependent fiscal multipliers, and the role of expectations in anchoring inflation. We proceed step by step for clarity.\n\n[Suggested visual: clean infographic listing the six topics. Alt text: “Overview infographic with six labeled boxes: GDP components; Output gap; Phillips curve; Interest-rate transmission; Fiscal multipliers; Expectations and inflation.”]\n\n2/9\nGDP components frame how aggregate demand is organized: consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports. Thinking in these components helps trace how policy and shocks propagate through the economy.\n\n[Suggested visual: stacked bar chart illustrating shares of GDP components. Alt text: “Stacked bars showing relative sizes of consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports as parts of GDP.”]\n\n3/9\nThe output gap—difference between actual output and potential output—captures economic slack. A positive gap signals overheating; a negative gap signals underutilized resources. The size and sign of this gap shape inflation pressure and policy choices.\n\n[Suggested visual: line chart of actual vs. potential output with shaded gap. Alt text: “Two lines (actual and potential GDP) with shaded areas indicating positive and negative output gaps.”]\n\n4/9\nPhillips curve debates center on the relationship between inflation and economic slack (or unemployment). Disagreements persist about its slope, stability over time, and the extent to which it shifts with shocks, regime changes, and expectations.\n\n[Suggested visual: scatter plot of inflation vs. unemployment with fitted curve. Alt text: “Scatter of inflation on unemployment with a downward-sloping fit and bands showing uncertainty.”]\n\n5/9\nMonetary policy transmits mainly via interest-rate channels. Policy rate changes influence borrowing costs, asset prices, credit conditions, exchange rates, and ultimately spending decisions—with variable and often long lags.\n\n[Suggested visual: flowchart from “Policy rate” to “Market rates → Credit/asset prices → Spending → Output/Inflation.” Alt text: “Flow diagram showing the interest-rate transmission chain to demand and inflation.”]\n\n6/9\nFiscal multipliers vary with slack. When the economy has sizable underutilized capacity, multipliers tend to be larger; when the economy is near capacity, multipliers shrink as crowding-out pressures and supply constraints intensify.\n\n[Suggested visual: bar chart showing higher multiplier in high-slack vs. low-slack states. Alt text: “Two bars comparing multipliers: high-slack (larger), low-slack (smaller).”]\n\n7/9\nExpectations help anchor inflation dynamics. When households, firms, and markets view future inflation as stable—and policy as credible—price and wage setting becomes less sensitive to temporary shocks, aiding inflation control.\n\n[Suggested visual: time series with inflation deviations converging back to target. Alt text: “Inflation line fluctuating but reverting toward a horizontal target line.”]\n\n8/9\nPolicy mix matters. With a negative output gap, interest-rate cuts and targeted fiscal support reinforce each other; with an overheating economy, tighter policy and credible communication curb inflation. Expectations and slack jointly guide calibration.\n\n[Suggested visual: two-panel graphic: left (negative gap) showing supportive mix; right (positive gap) showing restrictive mix. Alt text: “Two panels depicting policy combinations under slack vs. overheating.”]\n\n9/9\nKey takeaways: think in components (GDP), diagnose slack (output gap), be cautious about simple trade-offs (Phillips), track transmission lags (rates), match fiscal stance to slack (multipliers), and maintain credibility (expectations). #Macroeconomics\n\nSource: user-provided macro primer.

Source: user-provided explainer. #Blockchain #Web3\n\n2/8\nDistributed ledgers = a shared, append-only record replicated across many nodes. This boosts transparency and fault tolerance while reducing single points of failure. Visual: network graph of nodes syncing a ledger. Alt: nodes sharing the same log. #DLT #DistributedSystems\n\n3/8\nConsensus via Proof-of-Stake: validators lock stake, propose/attest blocks, and risk slashing for misbehavior—aligning incentives with security. It’s more energy-efficient than PoW and aims for economic finality. cc @vitalik #ProofOfStake #Ethereum\n\n4/8\nSmart contracts are programs that execute on-chain, enabling automated agreements (escrow, DAOs, DeFi) without intermediaries. Benefits: transparency and composability; trade-offs: bugs are costly—audits and formal checks matter. #SmartContracts #Crypto\n\n5/8\nScalability via sharding: split the network’s data/transactions into shards to process in parallel.

    "groundtruth": "Here’s your 7-tweet semi-formal Twitter thread on green hydrogen, built from the DOE and IEA sources you provided. It includes a hook, concise conclusion, one engagement question, a poll, two suggested images with alt-text, and one infographic concept. Citations are included in-thread, and an unrolled version follows.\n\n1/7\nGreen hydrogen is moving from buzzword to backbone for decarbonization. Here’s a quick 101: what it is, how it’s made, where it fits, and what’s holding it back. Sources: @ENERGY and @IEA. #Hydrogen #CleanEnergy #ClimateTech\n\n2/7\nWhat is it? Green H2 is hydrogen made by splitting water via electrolysis using renewable electricity. The process produces hydrogen and oxygen with no direct CO2 at the point of production. (DOE: https://www.energy.gov/articles/green-hydrogen-101)\n\nMedia suggestion (attach to this tweet):\n- Image 1 alt-text: Close-up of a proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer stack fed by solar panels and wind turbines, with blue hydrogen bubbles forming and oxygen venting in the background.\n\n3/7\nWhy it matters: Green H2 can help decarbonize hard-to-electrify areas—steel, ammonia, refineries, long-haul transport—and provide long-duration energy storage to balance the grid. Which sector should lead early adoption in your view?\n\n4/7\nHow it’s made/moved: Electrolyzers (PEM, alkaline, solid-oxide) turn renewable power + water into H2. It’s stored as compressed gas or liquid, or converted (e.g., ammonia) for transport, then used as a fuel or industrial feedstock. (DOE: https://www.energy.gov/articles/green-hydrogen-101)\n\nMedia suggestion (attach to this tweet):\n- Image 2 alt-text: Row of white hydrogen storage tanks and a tube trailer at a renewable-powered facility, with safety signage and distant wind turbines under a clear sky.\n\n5/7\nStatus & costs: Clean H2 is growing but remains pricier than fossil-based H2. DOE’s Hydrogen Shot targets $1/kg for clean H2 this decade, and IEA notes an expanding project pipeline globally. Policy + scale are key. (IEA: https://www.iea.org/reports/global-hydrogen-review-2023)\n\nInfographic concept (attach here):\n- Concept + alt-text: A simple flow diagram showing renewable electricity → electrolyzer (water in, H2 + O2 out) → three branches: (1) industry (steel/ammonia), (2) transport (trucks/shipping), (3) grid storage. Clean icons, clear arrows, blue-green palette.\n\n6/7\nPoll: What’s the biggest barrier to green hydrogen adoption?\n- Cost\n- Infrastructure\n- Technology readiness\n- Policy\n\n7/7\nBottom line: When powered by renewables, green H2 can complement electrification, decarbonize heavy industry, and store energy—if we scale infrastructure, cut costs, and align policy. Follow @ENERGY and @IEA for updates. #Hydrogen #CleanEnergy #ClimateTech\nSources: DOE (https://www.energy.gov/articles/green-hydrogen-101), IEA (https://www.iea.org/reports/global-hydrogen-review-2023)\n\nUnroll option: Reply “unroll” to get this as a single, shareable post—or use the unrolled version below.\n\nUnrolled version (single post):\nGreen hydrogen is made by splitting water via electrolysis using renewable electricity, producing hydrogen and oxygen with no direct CO2 at the point of production (DOE). It matters because it can decarbonize hard-to-electrify sectors—like steel, ammonia, and parts of transport—and provide long-duration energy storage to help balance the grid. Electrolyzers (PEM, alkaline, solid-oxide) convert renewable power and water into hydrogen, which can be stored (compressed or liquefied) or converted (e.g., ammonia) for transport and end-use. Today, clean hydrogen remains costlier than fossil-based hydrogen, but momentum is building: the U.S. DOE’s Hydrogen Shot targets $1/kg for clean hydrogen this decade, while the IEA reports an expanding global project pipeline and growing policy support. Key barriers include cost, infrastructure, technology readiness, and policy alignment. If we scale infrastructure, reduce costs with manufacturing and abundant renewables, and coordinate supportive policies, green hydrogen can complement electrification and accelerate decarbonization.

Building on reporting by @CityLab, this thread explores how proximity-based planning puts most daily needs within a short walk or bike ride—and the benefits and equity debates it raises. #UrbanPlanning #Mobility #Equity\n\n2/6\nAt its core, the 15-minute city prioritizes access over distance: housing, groceries, schools, clinics, parks, and transit are clustered so routine trips take ~15 minutes on foot or by bike. That implies mixed-use zoning, human-scale streets, and strong local services.\n\n3/6\nAnticipated benefits include reduced transport emissions via mode shift, less congestion, and improved air quality; stronger local economies as spending stays nearby; and greater social cohesion as public spaces and services bring neighbors into frequent contact.\n\n4/6\nKey critiques focus on implementation equity: Who gains 15-minute access first, and who bears costs? Without safeguards, upgrades can raise rents or bypass underserved areas. Equity calls for anti-displacement tools, fair service distribution, and affordable, accessible mobility.\n\n5/6\nPolicy levers typically include zoning reform (to enable mixed uses and gentle density), safer walking/biking networks, rebalanced street space, siting schools/clinics near homes, and phased pilots with clear metrics (access, travel time, affordability, health outcomes).\n\n6/6\nBottom line: the 15-minute city is a pragmatic access framework—promising when paired with inclusive planning and governance that measure who benefits.

Here’s how to use it effectively. 🍅 #Productivity @todoist\n\n2/12\nCore idea:\n• 25 minutes focused work (one “Pomodoro”)\n• 5-minute break\n• After 4 Pomodoros, take a longer 15–30 minute break\nNamed after a tomato kitchen timer—simple and powerful.\n\n3/12\nWhy it works:\n• Timeboxing creates urgency\n• Single-tasking lowers switching costs\n• Frequent, real breaks protect energy\n• A visible tally builds momentum\n\n4/12\nGetting started:\n1) Pick one clear task\n2) Set a 25-min timer\n3) Work with zero multitasking\n4) When the timer rings, stop and take 5\n5) Mark one Pomodoro complete\n\n5/12\nVisual suggestion 1: A clean, step-by-step infographic of the Pomodoro cycle (25→5, repeat ×4, then long break), with simple icons for “focus” and “break.”\nAlt text: “Infographic showing a 25-minute focus block, a 5-minute break, four cycles, then a longer 15–30 minute break, arranged in a circular flow.”\n\n6/12\nRight-size your tasks:\n• Break large projects into Pomodoro-sized steps\n• Batch tiny tasks into one Pomodoro\n• Finish early? Use remaining minutes to review notes, tidy, or plan the next step\n\n7/12\nHandle interruptions:\n• Note-and-park stray thoughts on paper\n• External requests: “I’m in a 25-min focus block—can I get back to you after?”\n• If an urgent interruption stops you, restart the Pomodoro (keep the standard intact)\n\n8/12\nMake breaks count:\nMove, hydrate, stretch, rest your eyes. Keep breaks restorative—avoid high-stimulus scrolling. The goal is to return fresh, not fried.\n\n9/12\nVisual suggestion 2: Calm scene of a person stepping away from a desk to stretch by a window between timers; soft light, minimal clutter, a small tomato timer on the desk.\nAlt text: “Person stretching near a window during a short break; a tomato kitchen timer rests on a tidy desk.”\n\n10/12\nCustomize with care:\n25/5 is a proven default, but 40/10 or 50/10 can suit deeper work. Key rule from the originator: a Pomodoro is indivisible—if it’s cut short, it doesn’t count. Adjust lengths, keep the rhythm.\n\n11/12\nTools and setup:\nAny timer works. Pair with @todoist to plan focus blocks:\n• Keep “Today” realistic\n• Group deep tasks together\n• Schedule 3–4 Pomodoros for a priority\n• Reflect at day’s end on how many you completed\n\n12/12\nWrap-up: Short bursts, real rests, steady progress. What Pomodoro duration works best for you right now? ⏱️\nSources: https://todoist.com/blog/pomodoro-technique • https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique\nWant an unrolled, single post?

Includes a question, a poll, two media suggestions with alt text, and an unroll option.\n\n1/9\nAI in healthcare is moving from pilots to practice. Three high-impact areas: diagnostics, triage, and workflow automation. The goal: safer, faster, more equitable care—without sacrificing privacy or trust. Here’s a practical map, including HIPAA, bias mitigation, and human-in-the-loop. #HealthTech #AI @WHO\n\n2/9\nDiagnostics: AI excels at pattern recognition (radiology, dermatology, pathology). Best use: decision support—flagging findings, quantifying risk, and prioritizing studies—not replacing clinicians. Set clear performance targets (sensitivity/specificity) and track real-world drift.\n\n3/9\nTriage: From ED early-warning scores to telehealth intake, AI can prioritize high-risk cases and route patients to the right level of care. Design for safety: conservative thresholds, auto-escalation when uncertain, and transparent rationale to support clinician judgment.\n\n4/9\nWorkflow automation: Reduce administrative load with AI scribing, prior auth prep, smart order sets, and queue management. Measure value via “time returned to care,” error reduction, and throughput. Start narrow (one workflow), iterate with user feedback, then scale.\n\n5/9\nHuman-in-the-loop (HITL): Keep clinicians in control. Use confidence thresholds, structured rationale, and easy “override” paths. Log decisions for auditability. In imaging, second-reader mode works well; in triage, require confirmation for high-consequence recommendations.\n\n6/9\nBias mitigation: Use representative, up-to-date training data. Evaluate across subgroups (age, sex, race/ethnicity, language, comorbidity). Track fairness metrics over time, monitor drift, and recalibrate locally. Encourage feedback loops (clinicians + patients) to catch blind spots early.\n\n7/9\nPrivacy, security, and regulation: Under HIPAA, apply minimum necessary access, encryption, de-identification where possible, and BAAs with vendors. Maintain audit logs, RBAC, and threat modeling. Validate models externally and align with @WHO guidance on ethics, accountability, and transparency.\n\n8/9\nPoll: Where will AI add the most value first?\n- Diagnostics\n- Triage\n- Admin tasks\n- Patient engagement\nVote and tell us why in the replies. #HealthTech #AI\n\n9/9\nBottom line: Start with clearly scoped use cases, build HITL safeguards, measure outcomes (clinical + operational), and iterate with equity and privacy in mind.

It can turn a labor of love into exhaustion and guilt. #OpenSource #Sustainability\n\n3/7\nWhy it happens: unclear boundaries, uneven workloads (“bus factor 1”), entitlement in requests, unfunded responsibilities, and release cadence pressure. When everything feels urgent, nothing is sustainable. #OpenSource #Sustainability\n\n4/7\nProtective practices for maintainers: set response windows (or “no SLA”), use issue/PR templates and labels, automate with bots (stale, CI), rotate duties, schedule “no‑merge” days, and take real breaks with coverage notes. #OpenSource #Sustainability\n\n5/7\nResources to learn and act: https://opensource.com/article/23/7/maintainer-burnout and https://www.tidelift.com/blog — please read, share, and support maintainers. #OpenSource #Sustainability\n\n6/7\nSuggested illustration for this thread:\nAlt text: A calm, softly lit 3D scene of a tired open source maintainer at a desk, laptop open, with supportive community figures behind them offering coffee, plants, and help, easing a swirl of issue/PR icons. #OpenSource\n\n7/7\nReflective question: What one boundary or support has most reduced your burnout—or what’s the first step you’ll try this week?

    "groundtruth": "1) Attention Is All You Need (Vaswani et al., 2017) introduces the Transformer, a sequence transduction model built entirely on attention—no recurrence or convolution—and achieves strong results in machine translation (see p.1). Source: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf #NLP #Transformers @GoogleDeepMind\n\n2) Architecture: an encoder–decoder composed of stacked layers. Each encoder layer has multi-head self-attention followed by a position-wise feed-forward network; the decoder mirrors this and adds encoder–decoder attention to condition on the source (see p.2). \n\n3) Core mechanism—scaled dot-product attention: Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax((QK^T)/sqrt(d_k)) V. Scaling by sqrt(d_k) stabilizes gradients and improves training for larger key/query dimensions (see p.3).\n\n4) Multi-head attention runs multiple attention “heads” in parallel, allowing the model to attend to information from different representation subspaces and positions. Outputs are concatenated and linearly projected (see p.4).\n\n5) Residual connections and layer normalization (“Add & Norm”) wrap each sub-layer, aiding gradient flow and stable optimization; position-wise feed-forward networks (two linear layers with ReLU between) apply the same transformation at each position (see p.2–5).\n\n6) Positional encodings inject order information without recurrence. Sinusoidal encodings use sine/cosine functions at varying frequencies, enabling the model to generalize to sequence lengths not seen during training (see p.6).\n\n7) Efficiency: Self-attention allows greater parallelization than RNNs and shortens the path between any two positions. The paper analyzes time complexity and memory, showing favorable trade-offs for self-attention at practical sequence lengths (see p.6).\n\n8) Training setup includes Adam with a custom learning-rate schedule with warmup, label smoothing (ε=0.1), and dropout. These choices are crucial for stability and performance (see p.7).\n\n9) Results: On WMT 2014 English–German and English–French, Transformer models achieve state-of-the-art BLEU at the time of publication. Ablations highlight the importance of multi-head attention and positional encodings (see p.8–9).\n\n10) Takeaway: The Transformer reframes sequence modeling around attention, enabling parallel training and strong performance across translation tasks. Which component do you find most impactful—multi-head attention, positional encodings, or the training schedule? Unroll available on request. #NLP #Transformers @GoogleDeepMind\n\nDiagram idea with alt-text:\n- Idea: A high-level block diagram of the Transformer showing (left) stacked encoder layers with self-attention + FFN, (right) stacked decoder layers with masked self-attention, encoder–decoder attention, and output. Include arrows for Q/K/V flows and positional encodings injected at inputs.\n- Alt text: “Schematic of the Transformer: multiple encoder layers (self-attention, feed-forward, add & norm) process the source sequence; decoder layers (masked self-attention, encoder–decoder attention, feed-forward, add & norm) generate the target sequence, with positional encodings added to inputs.”\n\nWould you like me to unroll this thread into a single, shareable post?\n\nDo you want a custom thumbnail for this thread?

The result: clearer plans, better timing, and less context switching. #Productivity #TimeManagement\n\n2/6\nTime-blocking: plan your day as blocks, not tasks. Pre-assign blocks by task type—Focus, Social, Admin. Protect your Focus blocks like appointments. Color-code for clarity and stick to start/stop times. Inspired by Cal Newport’s approach: https://www.calnewport.com/blog/ #Productivity\n\n3/6\nWeekly review (30–45 min):\n- Scan last week: what worked, what slipped\n- Prune tasks and capture new ones\n- Set next week’s top 3 outcomes\n- Pre-allocate Focus, Social, Admin blocks on your calendar\nThis keeps execution aligned with priorities. #Productivity #TimeManagement\n\n4/6\nEnergy tracking (simple and quick):\n- For a week, rate your energy 1–5 by time of day\n- Note when Focus, Social, and Admin feel easiest\n- Map tasks to your natural peaks/troughs\nExample: Deep work 9–11, meetings 1–3, admin 4–5. Adjust weekly. #Productivity\n\n5/6\nPut it together:\n- Morning: Focus blocks for deep work\n- Midday: Social blocks for meetings/collab\n- Late afternoon: Admin blocks for ops\nTools: calendar, task manager, and a short daily energy log.\nAttach image (suggested below). #TimeManagement #Productivity\n\n6/6\nPoll + Q: Which habit would help you most? Share a detail about your current routine, and I’ll offer one tweak.\nPoll:\n- Time-blocking\n- Weekly review\n- Energy tracking\n- Task batching\nReply “UNROLL” if you want this as a single, shareable post. #Productivity #TimeManagement\n\n\nSuggested visual for Tweet 5\n- Image concept: Clean weekly calendar mockup with three color-coded lanes (Focus = blue, Social = green, Admin = amber). Example day shows morning Focus blocks, midday Social, late afternoon Admin.

    "groundtruth": "Here’s a 7-tweet thread on the bullwhip effect, written in clear language for non-experts and ready for X:\n\n1/7\nWhat is the bullwhip effect? Small changes in shopper demand at the store ripple upstream as larger and larger swings in orders for distributors, manufacturers, and suppliers. The result: frequent stockouts, excess inventory, and higher costs. #SupplyChain #Operations\n\n2/7\nHow it amplifies: A 5% rise in store sales can prompt the retailer to order 10% more “just in case.” The distributor, seeing that spike, orders 20% more, and the factory ramps up even more. Each step adds buffers and reacts to delays, creating bigger waves than the original change.\n\n3/7\nKey cause 1: Demand signal processing. Many firms forecast from orders they receive (not real shopper sales). That “noisy” signal gets distorted as it moves upstream—especially with long lead times and limited visibility into point-of-sale data.\n\n4/7\nKey cause 2: Order batching. To save on shipping or meet minimum order quantities, companies place larger, less frequent orders. These “lumpy” orders create spikes that look like big swings in demand, even when shopper demand is fairly steady.\n\n5/7\nKey cause 3: Price promotions and shortage gaming. Temporary discounts pull orders forward (spikes), then drop afterward. When supply is tight, customers over-order to secure stock, then cancel later. These behaviors distort the true demand picture.\n\n6/7\nHow to reduce it: Share real-time POS data, shorten lead times, place smaller/more frequent orders, use stable pricing (fewer promotions), and allocate scarce supply using past sales (not current orders). Practices like VMI and CPFR align planning across partners.\n\n7/7\nWhy it matters: Taming the bullwhip cuts costs, improves service, and stabilizes production. Question: Which fix feels most achievable in your org—data sharing, shorter lead times, or order policy changes? Sources: HBR (https://hbr.org/2011/07/the-bullwhip-effect-in-supply-chains) and Hau L. Lee/MIT (https://www.mit.edu/~haulee/bullwhip/). Want this unrolled into one post? Reply: Unroll.\n\nInfographic concept (attach with alt-text):\n- Concept: “From Shopper to Supplier: Amplifying Waves”\n- Alt-text: A horizontal chain labeled Customer → Retailer → Distributor → Manufacturer → Supplier. A smooth, small wave at “Customer” grows into larger oscillations by “Supplier.” Arrows show lead time between stages. Icons indicate causes: a forecast chart (demand signal processing), stacked pallets (order batching), a price tag (promotions), and a warning triangle (rationing/gaming).\n\nWould you like me to unroll the thread into a single, shareable post now?\n\nTwitter thread thumbnail drafts (2 concepts, Pixar 3D style, no text, 1200x600):\n\nDraft A\n- Extracted topic: The bullwhip effect—small demand changes at retail amplify upstream into larger order and inventory swings.\n- Keywords: demand waves, amplification, shopper to supplier, lead time, batching, promotions, stability.\n- Visual elements: A 3D ribbon-like wave traveling left-to-right across five 3D scenes: shopper with cart (customer), store shelf (retailer), warehouse pallets (distributor), factory line (manufacturer), raw-material reels (supplier). The wave’s amplitude increases with each scene. Subtle arrow markers between scenes hint at lead time.\n- Mood and style: Informative, clean, bright Pixar-like 3D, soft lighting, smooth gradients from calm blues (left) to warmer, more intense hues (right) to signal amplification. No on-image text.\n- Size: 1200x600 (2:1).\n- Final concept: Left side shows a calm wave near the shopper; as the wave passes each stage, it grows taller and more dramatic near the supplier. Minimalist backgrounds to keep focus on the wave and the chain objects.\n\nDraft B\n- Extracted topic: Visualizing variability growth across the supply chain and the levers that drive it.\n- Keywords: oscillation, pipeline, flow, variability, stages, stability vs. volatility.\n- Visual elements: A transparent 3D “pipeline” made of glass capsules for each stage. Spheres (orders) pulse through the pipeline with small, even spacing at the Customer capsule and larger, uneven clusters toward Supplier. Subtle side props: a calendar page (lead time), a pallet stack (batching), and a dangling price tag (promotions).\n- Mood and style: Clean, professional Pixar 3D with soft shadows and saturated yet balanced colors. Calm tones at the left transitioning to dynamic, high-contrast tones at the right. No on-image text.\n- Size: 1200x600 (2:1).\n- Final concept: A left-to-right pipeline with orderly motion at the start and visible clumping toward the end, conveying amplification without clutter.\n\nWould you like to change the visual style from Pixar 3D (e.g., flat vector, isometric, or photographic), or proceed with one of these drafts?\n\nContact and extras\n- Feedback welcome: Davide, the plugin developer, would love your thoughts.

Balanced progress over hype. #MedAI #DigitalHealth @STATnews\n\n2/8\nRegulation is moving to a lifecycle model. FDA guidance emphasizes transparency, post-market monitoring, and Predetermined Change Control Plans (PCCPs) so models can update safely—especially in imaging, where most clearances sit.\nSuggested visual: Infographic timeline of FDA AI/ML device clearances by year and modality.\nAlt text: A clean timeline showing increasing bars over years, color-coded by modality (imaging, cardiology, etc.), with icons for scans and devices.\n\n3/8\nAmbient documentation is rising fast. AI “scribes” promise time savings and reduced burnout by capturing clinical conversations and structuring notes. Watchouts: accuracy, patient consent, privacy, and clear clinician review before signing.\n\n4/8\nImaging AI is maturing from single-use algorithms to integrated platforms. Workflow fit beats raw accuracy: triage, prioritization, and quality checks that reduce time-to-read and flag urgent cases across diverse scanners and sites.\nSuggested visual: Clinical workflow diagram (patient scan → AI triage → radiologist review → report → EHR).\nAlt text: A left-to-right flow with icons for a CT scanner, AI chip, radiologist workstation, and EHR screen, arrows connecting each step.\n\n5/8\nSafety and fairness are front and center. Expect more “shadow mode” testing, drift detection, and subgroup performance audits. Clear escalation paths, human-in-the-loop fail-safes, and audit trails build trust and accountability.\n\n6/8\nEconomics and integration drive adoption. Health systems want fewer clicks, FHIR-friendly data flows, and measurable ROI (throughput, fewer denials, less burnout).
