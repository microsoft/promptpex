Exact results will vary by skin type, climate and activity level, so treat this as broad advice rather than a guaranteed 24-hour formula.\n\n1. Skin prep  \n • Start with clean, slightly damp skin—right after showering is ideal.  \n • Apply a rich, unscented or very lightly scented body lotion to lock in moisture (hydrated skin holds perfume much better).\n\n2. Base layer: fragrance oil or balm  \n • If you have a neutral carrier oil or a fragrance-free balm, lightly dab it onto pulse areas (wrists, inner elbows, behind ears).  \n • Oils help “anchor” the scent.\n\n3. Main fragrance application  \n • Wait 3–5 minutes so the moisturizer and oil absorb.  \n • Hold your Baccarat Rouge 540 bottle a few inches from the skin and mist each pulse point once or twice.  \n • Let it air-dry—do not rub, which can break up the fragrance molecules.\n\n4. Top layer: hair mist or scarf spray  \n • Hair fibers and fabrics hold scent extremely well. A quick spritz of a light hair mist or a textile spray on a scarf/coat collar can extend performance.  \n • Avoid soaking—just a brief mist.\n\n5. Midday refresh (optional)  \n • If you’re aiming for maximum longevity, carry a small travel spray. A single light spritz on pulse points around the 6–8-hour mark can brighten things up without overpowering.\n\n6. Sleep-time scent boost  \n • If you need fragrance to linger overnight, give a very light mist onto pajamas or bedding before lights-out. The heat of your body will gently diffuse the scent as you sleep.\n\nGeneral tips  \n • Layer sparingly rather than over-spraying once.  \n • Keep the perfume out of heat and direct sunlight to preserve its structure.  \n • Test small adjustments—everyone’s skin chemistry is different, so tweak timings and layers until you find your sweet spot.",
