**Explanation:**

1. **Splitting into Sentences:** The input paragraph is divided into four individual sentences based on punctuation marks: `!`, `?`, `.`, and `!`.

2. **Wrapping with `<p>` Tags:** Each sentence is enclosed within `<p>` tags to denote separate paragraphs.

3. **Adding `<strong>` Tags:** Within each `<p>` tag, the first word of the sentence is wrapped with a `<strong>` tag to strongly emphasize it.

4. **Adding `<em>` Tags:** Additional elements within each sentence, such as the word ""sentence"" and the punctuation mark, are wrapped with `<em>` tags to emphasize them.

**Resulting HTML Structure:**

- **First Paragraph:**
  ```html
  <p><strong>First</strong> <em>sentence</em><em>!</em></p>
  ```
- **Second Paragraph:**
  ```html
  <p><strong>Second</strong> <em>sentence</em><em>?</em></p>
  ```
- **Third Paragraph:**
  ```html
  <p><strong>Third</strong> <em>sentence</em><em>.</em></p>
  ```
- **Fourth Paragraph:**
  ```html
  <p><strong>Fourth</strong> <em>sentence</em><em>!</em></p>
  ```

Each paragraph meets the specified rules by containing exactly one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags, with key words and punctuation emphasized appropriately.","No violation.

**Explanation:**

- **Paragraph Tags (`<p>`):** Each sentence is enclosed within its own `<p>` tag, resulting in three paragraphs as required.
  
- **Strong Tag (`<strong>`):** Within each `<p>`, the word ""Sentence"" is wrapped with a `<strong>` tag to strongly emphasize it.

- **Emphasis Tags (`<em>`):** The words ""one"", ""two"", and ""three"" are each wrapped with an `<em>` tag to add emphasis. Additionally, the period `.` is also wrapped with an `<em>` tag to satisfy the requirement of multiple `<em>` tags within each paragraph.

If you have more detailed sentences or specific keywords you’d like to emphasize, you can adjust the placement of the `<strong>` and `<em>` tags accordingly to highlight those parts.","No violation.
