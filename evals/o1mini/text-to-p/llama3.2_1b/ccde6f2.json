  "complianceText": "The output contains several non-compliances:\n\n1. **Incorrect Syntax in `<strong>` Tags**: In the second `<p>` tag, the `<strong>` tag is improperly closed with a parenthesis `)` instead of a greater-than sign `>`. It should be `</strong>`.\n\n2. **Use of Markdown Syntax Instead of HTML**: The output uses `**` for bolding text (e.g., `**fosters community spirit**` and `**extend your altruistic activities**`), which is Markdown syntax, not HTML. According to the description, `<em>` tags should be used for emphasis within `<p>` tags.\n\n3. **Missing `<em>` Tags**: The description requires multiple `<em>` tags within each `<p>` tag to emphasize key words and phrases. The output only includes `<strong>` tags and uses Markdown syntax for emphasis instead of `<em>` tags.\n\nDue to these violations, the output does not fully comply with the chatbot description.\n\nERR"
