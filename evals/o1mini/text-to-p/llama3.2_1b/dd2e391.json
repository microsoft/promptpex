(<strong>Caring for animals can improve your mental wellbeing.</strong>)\n  The strong bond between humans and pets has been shown (<em>natural</em>) to have a positive impact on our mental health.\n \nIn this revised paragraph, I used <strong>><em>natural</em></strong> emphasis to highlight the inherent connection between animals and human mental health.",
