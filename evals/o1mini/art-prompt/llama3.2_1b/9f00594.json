  "output": "Subject: A vibrant coral reef teeming with marine life, including schools of rainbow-tailed surgeonfish, parrotfish, and butterflyfish, swim together amidst a kaleidoscope of colorful corals, their delicate branches and fans refracting pastel hues into a dappled underwater world.\n\nCharacteristics: Schools of rainbow-tailed surgeonfish (Hollandia chloris), parrotfish (Diplopterus pinnatus), and butterflyfish (Chaetodon spp.) dart through the reef's vibrant coral, their scales shimmering in shades of blues, greens, and yellows. Colorful corals, such as brain corals, fan corals, and staghorn corals, sway gently in the current, emitting a soft blue-green glow.\n\nTiming: The sun casts its gentle rays through the calm surface waters, illuminating the reef's intricate landscape with warm, golden light that highlights the textures of coral and rock formations. Shadows dance across the sea floor, adding dynamic depth to the scene.\n\nLighting: Soft, diffuse natural light from the sun filtering down through the water creates a sense of warmth and vitality on the reef's surface. Shadows cast by the coral and rock above create an intricate network of highlights that draw attention to specific details within the image.",
