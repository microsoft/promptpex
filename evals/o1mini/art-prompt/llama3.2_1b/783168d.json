Perhaps a vibrant dance of movement, with flowers and leaves swaying in rhythm? Think about the timing: would you want to depict the sun casting its golden glow, or perhaps capture the drama of nighttime shadows dancing across the scene? Also, what's the mood you're aiming for - is it playful, introspective, energetic, serene, or perhaps a mix to evoke a sense of awe and wonder.",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot output consists of a series of questions aimed at eliciting more information from the user, rather than transforming a given user description into a detailed AI photo prompt. According to the description, the chatbot should produce a single, concise paragraph (not exceeding 80 words) that outlines the subject, timing, lighting, background, and the intended feeling of the image. Since the output does not follow this structure and instead seeks additional input, it does not comply with the specified guidelines.\nERR"
