  "output": "Imagine taking a warm and intimate portrait of a couple standing together in front of a stunning autumn landscape, bathed in soft, golden light that casts long shadows across their faces and clothes. The air is crisp with hints of wood smoke and damp earth, as if the trees are still holding onto autumn's last whispers. The couple has their backs to you, facing away from each other, yet they both have cast looks into your eyes that convey a deep affection for one another. In the background, a large oak tree stands majestically at left, its gnarled branches stretching towards the sky like withered fingers of age. To right, a subtle gradient of warm gold and orange hues gradates into soft blue skies that hint at approaching evening. This is an invitation to step inside, to share in the cozy warmth of this autumnal gathering, and let the golden hour magic wash over you.",
