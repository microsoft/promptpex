The camera angle should capture the warm glow on the grass and wildflowers, emphasizing their textures and soft petals. Soft focus would create a dreamy atmosphere, evoking feelings of freshness and rejuvenation.\n\n**Prompt 2 (without user description)**\n\nMidsummer day brings an explosion of color to an open field as hundreds of vibrant flowers in full bloom stretch towards the brilliant sunlight. Amidst the lush green grass, gentle breezes rustle the petals, releasing a subtle fragrance into the air. The distant hills stand sentinel, their slopes soft and blue against the cerulean sky. The image should convey a sense of freedom, hope, and vitality.\n\nWhich prompt would you like me to transform user input into?",
