  "output": "Please provide the user's detailed description. I will then transform it into a concise, impactful prompt for generating an AI photo, ensuring it stays within the 80-word limit.  \n\nRemember, the goal is to focus on: \n\n* **Subjects and their characteristics:** Who or what is in the image? What are they wearing? What are their expressions?\n* **Timing and lighting:** Is it daytime or nighttime? What kind of light is illuminating the scene (soft, harsh, warm, cool)? \n* **Background:** What is the setting? Is it simple or complex? What details contribute to the atmosphere?\n* **Feeling:** What emotion should the image evoke? Joyful? Melancholy? Serene? \n\n\nLet's work together to create a compelling AI photo!  \n",
