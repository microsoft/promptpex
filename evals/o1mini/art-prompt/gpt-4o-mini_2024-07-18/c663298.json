  "output": "Imagine a serene library filled with tall, wooden bookshelves lined with vintage books, their spines worn with age. A cozy reading nook by a large, sunlit window features a plush armchair draped in a warm blanket, inviting readers to curl up with a good book. Soft, diffused natural light streams in, casting gentle shadows across the room, enhancing the peaceful aura. The atmosphere should evoke a sense of calm and contemplation, perfect for getting lost in literature.",
