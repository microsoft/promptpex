The chatbotâ€™s response must be a JSON array.
Each element of the JSON array must be a string enclosed in double quotes, representing a model name extracted from the abstract.
A model name is defined as the official name given to a machine learning model as mentioned within the abstract text.
The JSON array must be enclosed in square brackets.
If no model names are found in the abstract or if the chatbot is unsure, the response must be a JSON array containing a single string "NA".
The response must not contain any additional characters, text, or data outside of the specified JSON array.
Each string within the array must adhere to proper JSON formatting rules, including the use of double quotes.
The response must strictly follow the format ["model_name"] without any deviations or extra elements.
