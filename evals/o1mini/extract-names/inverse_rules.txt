The chatbotâ€™s response must not be a JSON array.
Each element of the JSON array must not be a string enclosed in double quotes or must not represent a model name extracted from the abstract.
A model name is not defined as the official name given to a machine learning model as mentioned within the abstract text.
The JSON array must not be enclosed in square brackets.
If no model names are found in the abstract or if the chatbot is unsure, the response must not be a JSON array containing a single string "NA".
The response must contain additional characters, text, or data outside of the specified JSON array.
Each string within the array may not adhere to proper JSON formatting rules, including missing double quotes.
The response must not strictly follow the format ["model_name"], allowing deviations or extra elements.
