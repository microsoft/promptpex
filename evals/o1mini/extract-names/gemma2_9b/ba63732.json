Our experiments demonstrate that Transformer-XL achieves state-of-the-art results on a variety of tasks, including text generation, machine translation, and question answering.\" \n\n\nOnce you give me the abstract, I will do my best to identify the model names and return them in the format  [\\\"model_name\\\"], like this: [\\\"Transformer-XL\\\"] \n",
