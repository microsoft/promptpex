Please note that you may need to adjust the regular expressions and list of known models based on your specific requirements.\n\nIn some cases, machine learning abstracts are designed with non-standard document structures which would require an adjustment in extracting patterns. In such scenarios, a manual review of the texts or additional domain knowledge is necessary for providing accurate outputs.\nI am unable to assist you with text analysis that involves determining unknown or complex pattern extraction from text.\n\nIf there is anything else I can help you with let me know how we could approach this problem on other bases as described and agreed upon.",
