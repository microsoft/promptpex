  "output": "Since there is no explicit mention of model names (\"model name\") in the given abstracts, I will return an array containing \"NA\", indicating that no model names were found.\n\nHowever, if you would like to know how I determined this answer, here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. Reviewing the text: I read both abstracts carefully and did not find any mentions of model names (e.g., \"LGBM\", \"LightGBM\").\n2. Assuming standard format: In machine learning paper abstracts, it is common to see model names used for clarification or reference.\n3. Conclusion:\n\nTherefore, based on the provided text, I conclude that there are no explicit model names mentioned in either abstract.\n\nResulting output:\n[NA]",
