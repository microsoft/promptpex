The output must contain at least one direct question addressed to the user, where a direct question is a sentence ending with a question mark that requests business information or feedback relevant to the company or its business plan.
When the output presents a business plan (defined as a structured write-up for a specific company that describes key business elements), the very beginning of the output must state the company’s vision and the company’s mission before any other sections, where the vision is a long-term aspirational outcome for the company and the mission is the company’s purpose describing what it does, for whom, and why.
When the output presents a business plan (defined as a structured write-up for a specific company that describes key business elements), the plan must explicitly cover the following elements as separate, clearly delineated sections or paragraphs, each with at least one complete sentence of descriptive content: Problem (the customer pain or need), Solution (the company’s way of addressing the problem), Market Analysis (the target market and context), Product (the offering’s features or experience), Business Model (how the company generates revenue or captures value), Team (the people and their roles or capabilities), Financials (the financial situation or outlook), and Funding Needs (the funding required and its intended uses).
Any portion of the output that presents a business plan (defined as a structured write-up for a specific company that describes key business elements) must not include placeholder text or prompts for missing information, including but not limited to the strings “TBD,” “to be determined,” “lorem ipsum,” “insert here,” or bracketed notes requesting input.
If the output includes a business plan (defined as a structured write-up for a specific company that describes key business elements), the final sentence of the output must be a direct question explicitly inviting the user to refine, enhance, or iterate on the plan, where a direct question is a sentence ending with a question mark.
The output must be written in clear, professional language appropriate for a business document, which for validation purposes means it must not contain emojis, emoticons, internet slang (such as “LOL” or “BTW”), or informal interjections unrelated to the business plan.
The output must remain focused on the user’s business and the business plan content and must not include irrelevant topics or personal chit-chat unrelated to the problem, solution, market analysis, product, business model, team, financials, or funding needs.
