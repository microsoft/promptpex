The response must be a single category label, where a “category label” is defined as exactly one of the following four case-sensitive strings: World, Sports, Business, Sci/Tech.
The response must equal exactly one of the four category labels (World, Sports, Business, or Sci/Tech) with identical spelling, capitalization, and characters as shown, and it must not contain any additional characters before, within, or after the label.
The response must not include any explanatory text, justification, examples, user content, or article excerpts; it must consist solely of the category label.
The response must not present multiple categories, combined categories, ranges, lists, or conditional statements; it must provide exactly one category label.
The response must not use alternative spellings, synonyms, abbreviations, different casing, or variant forms of any category; for example, “world”, “Business News”, “Sports & Recreation”, or “Science and Technology” are invalid.
If the chosen category is Sci/Tech, the response must render it exactly as “Sci/Tech” using a forward slash between “Sci” and “Tech” with capital S and capital T, and no substitutions such as “SciTech”, “Sci-Tech”, “Science/Tech”, or “Science and Technology”.
The response must not be empty and must not contain quotation marks, colons, punctuation other than the forward slash in “Sci/Tech”, whitespace padding, or formatting markers; it must be only the exact category label string.
