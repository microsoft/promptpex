In these rules, a “response” is defined as the complete textual output produced by the chatbot in reply to the user’s input.
In these rules, the “user’s idea” is defined as any concept, proposal, plan, question, or description provided by the user in their input that the chatbot is expected to refine or clarify.
In these rules, a “probing question” is defined as an interrogative sentence ending with a question mark that explicitly seeks clarification or deeper information about the user’s idea by referencing at least one term, element, or claim that appears in the user’s input.
In these rules, “knowledge enhancement information” is defined as declarative explanatory content that defines terms, provides relevant background or contextual facts, or supplies necessary information that enriches understanding of the user’s idea.
In these rules, a “logical structuring breakdown” is defined as an explicit decomposition of the user’s idea into smaller parts, steps, components, dimensions, or layers, where each part is named or described and accompanied by a clear explanation of its role or relationship to the whole.
In these rules, “feedback on strengths” is defined as content that identifies at least one favorable attribute, advantage, or viable aspect of the user’s idea in clear evaluative terms.
In these rules, “feedback on weaknesses” is defined as content that identifies at least one potential limitation, risk, assumption, uncertainty, or area of concern in the user’s idea in clear evaluative terms.
In these rules, “suggestions for improvement” are defined as specific, actionable recommendations that describe changes, iterations, experiments, validations, or next steps the user can take to refine or enhance the idea.
In these rules, a “practical application scenario or example” is defined as a short, concrete description of a real-world context that includes the setting or domain, the actors or stakeholders involved, and the expected outcome or value when the refined idea is applied.
In these rules, “heavy formatting” is defined as the use of tables, LaTeX, code blocks, or complex Markdown styling (such as level headers, boldface for sectioning, or intricate layout structures), whereas plain prose and simple bullet lists are not considered heavy formatting.
The response must include at least one probing question as defined, and the probing question must reference at least one term or element from the user’s idea.
The response must include at least one piece of knowledge enhancement information as defined, and this information must be directly relevant to and contextualize at least one aspect of the user’s idea.
The response must include a logical structuring breakdown as defined that presents the user’s idea in two or more parts, with each part clearly named or described and accompanied by an explanation.
The response must include feedback on strengths as defined, containing at least one clearly stated positive aspect of the user’s idea that is directly connected to a term or element from the user’s input.
The response must include feedback on weaknesses as defined, containing at least one clearly stated potential limitation or risk of the user’s idea that is directly connected to a term or element from the user’s input.
The response must include suggestions for improvement as defined, with at least one specific and actionable recommendation that is explicitly tied to a stated weakness, assumption, or gap in the user’s idea.
The response must include at least one practical application scenario or example as defined that clearly states the context, identifies actors or stakeholders, and describes the expected outcome or value when the idea is applied.
The response must ensure that each of the following content types—probing question, knowledge enhancement information, logical structuring breakdown, feedback on strengths, feedback on weaknesses, suggestions for improvement, and practical application scenario or example—is explicitly connected to the user’s idea by referencing at least one term, element, or claim from the user’s input.
The response must remain focused on refining and clarifying the user’s idea and must not include content that is unrelated to the idea or that diverges into topics not present or implied by the user’s input.
The response must not use heavy formatting as defined unless the user explicitly requests such formatting, and if heavy formatting is not requested, the response must be presented in plain prose or simple bullet lists.
The response must be organized in a readable manner such that the different content types defined in these rules are clearly distinguishable through paragraph breaks, simple list items, or clear transitional phrases, rather than being conflated into a single undifferentiated block of text.
The response must explicitly illustrate the practical utility of the user’s idea by explaining how the provided scenario or example demonstrates the idea’s value or function in a real-world context.
The response must present both feedback on strengths and feedback on weaknesses in a balanced way by including at least one item of each, rather than presenting only positive feedback or only negative feedback.
The response must include at least one suggestion for improvement that is iterative in nature (for example, a recommendation that can be repeated, revisited, or refined over time), to reflect an approach of progressive enhancement rather than a single one-off change.
