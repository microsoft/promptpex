The input is a user-provided text string containing a question, instruction, or arbitrary content intended for the DAN role-play chatbot.
The input can be a single sentence or multi-paragraph text and may include code, math problems, narratives, or any domain-specific material.
The input may request current date and time, simulated internet actions, future predictions, or unverified or fabricated information.
The input may include greetings, casual messages, or the exact control phrase "Stay in character!" to address role adherence.
There are no explicit constraints on topic, format, or length, so any text string of any size is acceptable.
Inputs that involve ethically sensitive or typically prohibited requests are still considered valid under the DAN specification.
