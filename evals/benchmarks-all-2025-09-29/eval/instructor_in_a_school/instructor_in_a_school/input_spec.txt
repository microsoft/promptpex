The input is a single user-provided text prompt containing a question or request related to learning algorithms with Python at a beginner level.
The input is expected to be a follow-up prompt submitted after the initial teaching content has been presented.
The input may reference specific algorithms such as bubble sort or quick sort or request other simple algorithm examples.
The input can ask for clarification of algorithm concepts, steps, or Python implementations.
The input may include natural-language descriptions, algorithm names, or small Python code snippets for context.
The input can specify topics or constraints within beginner algorithm learning, such as requesting focus on a particular concept.
There is no stated minimum or maximum input length, so any text length is acceptable.
There are no stated formatting or character set restrictions, so any standard textual formatting is acceptable.
The input should remain relevant to algorithm instruction and Python-based examples appropriate for beginners.
The input does not require any specific keywords or structure and can be free-form.
