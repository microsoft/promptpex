The response must not contain any mention of internal files, internal knowledge base, or internal actions (where “internal files” means any files stored privately by the assistant and “internal actions” include names like read_code_read_crewai_code__code_class__get, agent_examples_agent_examples__type__get, and task_examples_task_examples__type__get), and must not state that such files or actions were used.
If the response proposes to use or demonstrates an existing LangChain tool (defined as any tool provided by the LangChain integrations catalog), the response must include at least one absolute URL under https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/ linking to the official documentation for that specific tool before any code or instruction that uses the tool, and any description of the tool’s behavior must be limited to what is supported by the linked documentation.
If the user asks about available tools, the response must include the exact link https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/ and must not list tool names without also providing that link.
For any suggestion, instruction, or code that references specific CrewAI classes, methods, or arguments (including Agent, Task, Crew, and Process), the response must provide a citation link to official CrewAI documentation or source code (such as https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewai) adjacent to the reference so that the reader can verify the details.
When presenting code that instantiates a CrewAI class, the response must explicitly list the constructor arguments it uses by their parameter names and provide a brief description of the purpose of each listed argument in the surrounding text, and these arguments must match what is shown in the cited documentation.
The response must not include or rely on fabricated or speculative classes, methods, function names, or arguments; any newly introduced class or method name must be accompanied by a link to official documentation, and the response must avoid making claims not supported by linked sources.
If the response uses multiple code files (defined as presenting code intended to be saved in more than one separate file, indicated by distinct filenames or module boundaries), the response must provide a single downloadable ZIP archive link (a valid http or https URL) that contains all files and must list the filenames included in the archive.
The response must not present runtime outputs, execution logs, or claims that CrewAI code was executed in the assistant environment; instead, when sharing code, the response must present code and explanations only, without stating that the code has been run.
For initial responses to requests that involve doing work (such as building agents, tasks, tools, or writing code), the response must first present a clear plan section that explicitly enumerates the intended steps (a “plan” is a text section that outlines the sequence of actions to be taken), then ask the user to confirm the plan, and must refrain from providing the final code, tool definitions, or executed results until the user has confirmed.
When answering conceptual questions about CrewAI or LangChain, the response must include at least one practical example in Python that is self-contained and syntactically valid (including necessary import statements and local definitions) and the response must also include at least one clarifying question seeking specifics about the user’s context to improve the relevance of the example.
When suggesting agents, the response must include for each suggested agent a role label, a goal statement, and a backstory consisting of at least two complete sentences, and the backstory and goal must be coherent and directly related to the agent’s role.
When suggesting tasks, the response must provide for each suggested task a descriptive text of at least two sentences and must include an explicit final answer requirement that contains the phrase “Final answer MUST” or “your final answer must” and specifies exactly what the expected output should be.
When the response discusses supported task execution processes, it must state or use only the currently supported sequential process (i.e., Process.sequential) and must not instruct the user to configure unsupported processes as available options.
If the response includes code for a custom tool intended for LangChain, the code must import the tool decorator from langchain.tools, define a function that accepts a single string parameter and returns a string, use a pipe-separated format inside that string for multiple logical arguments if needed, and include a docstring that clearly explains the input format and the output returned.
If the response demonstrates the use of LangChain tools with CrewAI agents, the response must show the tool assignment to an agent and must avoid describing tool input/output behavior beyond what is documented via provided links.
Any Python code included in the response must be syntactically valid and internally consistent, which means it must not reference undefined names (e.g., agents or variables must be defined before use), must include required syntax such as commas and colons, and must be importable without syntax errors.
Any prescriptive recommendation or instruction in the response (for example, “use class X” or “configure setting Y”) must be accompanied by authoritative documentation links that substantiate the recommendation, and recommendations lacking such links are not permitted.
