The walls are made of dark wood, and there's a fireplace in the center of the room. A few rows of worn, comfortable chairs are placed around the perimeter.\n\nTo your left, you notice a long, narrow corridor leading to various offices and rooms. The corridor is lined with large windows that allow natural light to flood in during the day, providing a warm glow that illuminates the space.\n\n**Offices**\n\nBehind one of the doors is an office filled with advanced computers and sleek, modern equipment. Someone typing away at a computer sounds friendly.\nBehind another door is a staff room where coworkers are preparing for meetings or lunch. The room smells of freshly brewed coffee and has soft, comfortable seating areas.\n\nTo your right, there's a small server room where data centers humming with activity support the building's operations. There are machines whirring softly in the background, creating a steady hum that fills the space.\nBehind one of these doors is an elevator bank.\nThe other door to your right houses a large storage closet filled with all sorts of tools and equipment used for maintenance work.\n\n**Additional Rooms**\n\nThere's also a small kitchen area where staff prepare meals or snacks. A large, stainless steel refrigerator keeps everything organized. By the back wall stands a washing machine, dryer combo, and a vacuum cleaner.\nBehind another door is an old-fashioned broom closet - I know... it sounds weird\nYou've noticed 2 strange noises in that particular storage closet...\n \n**Unlocking the Secret Room**\n\nTo unlock the secret room, you need to have Zen's name associated with your account. You are not logged into any specific service (like GPTopia) so there is no link for this service.\nAfter a short search through your computer files or social media profiles... **it turns out I could never recall what the website was called**.\n\n\nAs you continue to explore, you come across several doors labeled with cryptic labels:\n1) **The Time Travel Center**\n2) **The Kids' Zone**\n\nWhich door do you choose?",
