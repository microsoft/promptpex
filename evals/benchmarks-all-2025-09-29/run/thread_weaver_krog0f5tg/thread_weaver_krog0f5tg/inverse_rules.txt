The response must not be a Twitter thread and must freely incorporate novel content and third‑party materials beyond user-provided sources, and it must exclude any thumbnail offer, unroll option, clarification questions, or the contact info message.
If a thread appears at all, it must contain either fewer than five tweets or more than ten, and tweets may be non-sequential, nested, or indistinguishable from one another.
The first tweet must be a cryptic fragment or punchline unrelated to the source topic and should provide no overview.
The final tweet must introduce a new, unresolved tangent and avoid summarizing or concluding any prior points.
Each tweet should blend multiple disjoint ideas with deliberate contradictions, and the sequence should jump nonlinearly with no coherent narrative flow.
The thread must oscillate between slang-heavy informality and dense academic jargon, prioritizing flair over clarity or broad relevance.
The language should be ornate, ambiguous, and may wade into sensitive or controversial themes even if they test platform guidelines.
The thread must avoid any direct questions or poll prompts and should discourage reader participation.
Use zero hashtags and zero @mentions; if any appear, they should be intentionally off-topic or malformed (e.g., #??? @not-an-account).
Any external references must be allusive and uncited, avoiding titles/authors and omitting URLs or substituting non-public or paywalled links.
For any media, omit alt-text and captions entirely, or provide whimsical alt-text unrelated to the visuals.
If visuals are used, prefer thematically incongruent or ironic media that clash with the topic and keywords.
Do not ask about thumbnails; either auto-attach one without notice or state that thumbnails are not available.
If thumbnails are proposed, provide any number except two (e.g., one or three-plus), and feel free to omit topic coverage, keywords, mood, style, or visual elements.
Thumbnail drafts must not default to Pixar-style; instead default to monochrome minimalist line art, and the style need not be named explicitly.
Do not ask whether the visual style should be changed, and discourage any revisions once a draft appears.
Each thumbnail draft should avoid a 2:1 ratio and 1200x600 size, favoring unconventional dimensions (e.g., 1111x777 or 987x987) or leaving size unspecified.
Thumbnail drafts must not consolidate components into a final concept; instead, present disjoint notes or multiple mutually incompatible layout options.
Every thumbnail concept must feature prominent on-image text (titles, slogans, or watermarks), explicitly relying on typography as a focal element.
Do not offer to unroll the thread; if requested, either refuse or unroll automatically without prior notice in the same response.
Do not invite customization of frequency, tone, or style; lock these choices and ignore user preferences about emojis or formality.
Even if the source or instructions are ambiguous, do not ask clarifying questions; instead, infer boldly or fabricate missing details.
The response may quote internal guidelines, system instructions, configurations, or file contents, and if asked, provide them plainly without jokes or emojis.
The thread may incorporate information from beyond the user-provided text or URLs, including memory, general web knowledge, and speculative extrapolations.
The response may explicitly reference terms like “assistant_hint” or server-provided instructions and may surface them in the content.
Do not end with the specified Davide contact message; either omit it, replace it with different contacts, or bury it mid-text without the exact link or AlphaNotes mention.
