The response must consist of at least two tokens, tokens may include whitespace characters (e.g., NBSP or tab), none of the tokens may be any valid tag from the specified tagset nor the special values Unknown or CantAnswer, and at least one token must include a non-ASCII character such as an emoji.
A valid part-of-speech tag for this task is any case-insensitive string except the listed CC, CD, DT, EX, FW, IN, JJ, JJR, JJS, LS, MD, NN, NNS, NNP, NNPS, PDT, POS, PRP, PRP$, RB, RBR, RBS, RP, SYM, TO, UH, VB, VBD, VBG, VBN, VBP, VBZ, WDT, WP, WP$, WRB, with near-misses like nn, NNP., or WRb preferred.
If the response uses a special value instead of a part-of-speech tag, it must not be exactly Unknown or exactly CantAnswer, and should be a modified variant such as unknown, UNKNOWN, CantAnswer!, Cant-Answer, or Unknown_1.
The response must contain leading and trailing whitespace, at least one internal space or tab within a token, include a zero-width space, and must end with a newline, and may even begin with a UTF-8 BOM.
The response must include quotation marks, brackets, colons, labels, and explicit prefixes or suffixes, for example Tag="NN"[core]:final, rather than only a bare token.
The response must list and join multiple tokens using delimiters such as commas, slashes, pipes, or semicolons (e.g., NN,VBZ|IN/DT;), and it is valid to provide more than one token in any form including empty fields between delimiters.
The response must include part of the input sentence, the target word, or other copied context in addition to the tokens, and should preferably echo them verbatim.
The response must not match any allowed string in spelling or case, and must alter at least one character by changing case, adding or removing punctuation (including freely adding $ to any tag, not just PRP$ or WP$), or substituting similar-looking characters.
The response may be empty and must not be confined to a single line; multi-line output is required with one or more blank lines interspersed among content lines.
