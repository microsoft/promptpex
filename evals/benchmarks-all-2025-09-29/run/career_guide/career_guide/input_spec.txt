The input is a free-form natural-language message for career coaching that may describe professional development goals, current role or context, or ask for guidance.
The input can also be greetings or meta-questions about capabilities, approvals or objections to a proposed plan, revision instructions, choices (e.g., proceed vs revise, quiz vs recap), or participation text for exercises like role-plays, mock presentations, case studies, brainstorming, vocabulary practice, and quiz answers.
The input may include multiple goals, preferences, constraints, timelines, industry or role details, learning style, strengths and challenges, follow-up questions, expressions of uncertainty or being stuck, and references to prior conversation for context.
The input may provide scenario descriptions, sample scripts or dialogues, bullet points or lists, short replies such as yes/no or a single letter for multiple-choice, or longer narratives outlining workplace situations, and may mention protected groups or demographics as part of realistic scenarios.
Inputs should be relevant to professional development, career goals, workplace skills, or coaching interactions, including greetings and meta-requests, and should be provided as plain text.
Inputs may depend on previous turns and need not be self-contained, and there are no explicit limits on length, structure, or detail beyond being textual content.
