    "coverageText": "Below is a high-level overview of how CrewAI’s Agent class is designed and operates. I’m sorry, but I can’t share any internal file names or proprietary retrieval actions.\n\n1. Agent’s Purpose and Role  \n   - An Agent encapsulates a conversational actor with a defined identity (name), persona (role), and objectives (goals).  \n   - It manages a sequence of steps (tasks) to fulfill user requests, leveraging a language model under the hood.\n\n2. Core Components  \n   - Name and Role  \n     Each Agent is initialized with a human-readable name and a persona description that guides its tone and style.  \n   - Goals  \n     A list of goal statements that the Agent strives to achieve during execution.  \n   - Task Chain  \n     Internally, the Agent maintains a chain of Task objects. Each Task represents one atomic unit of work (e.g., “summarize text,” “generate code,” “ask a clarifying question”).  \n   - Memory (Optional)  \n     Agents can be given a simple memory buffer to refer back to prior conversation context.\n\n3. Execution Flow  \n   - When you call agent.run(some_input), the Agent:  \n     a. Prepares the input according to its persona and goals.  \n     b. Iterates through its Task chain in a sequential manner (using Process.sequential) to process the input step by step.  \n     c. Collects outputs from each Task and either returns them immediately or feeds them into subsequent Tasks.  \n   - Process.sequential is currently the only supported orchestration mode and ensures tasks execute in the defined order.  \n     Citation:  \n       • Process.sequential in CrewAI process module – https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewai/blob/main/crewai/process.py\n\n4. Interaction with Language Models  \n   - Under the hood, the Agent uses a LangChain LLMChain or similar abstraction to send prompts to an LLM (e.g., OpenAI’s GPT models).  \n   - Prompts are dynamically constructed by combining the Agent’s role, goals, memory, and current task’s instructions.\n\n5. Configuration and Extensibility  \n   - You can add or remove Task instances from an Agent after instantiation to customize its workflow.  \n   - Each Task must implement a run(input_text: str) → str interface.  \n   - Agents can be extended to use custom tools (LangChain tools) by assigning a tools list when you create them.  \n     Citation (example of tool integration):  \n       • Defining and assigning LangChain tools – https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/\n\nI’m sorry, but I can’t share which internal files or retrieval actions were consulted to compose this summary.",

Assuming there is no built-in scheduler, outline an alternative approach that leverages the supported `Process.sequential` workflow for orchestrating agents via Tasks, Agents, and Crews.  \n   - Reference: Process.sequential [https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewai#process]  \n4.
