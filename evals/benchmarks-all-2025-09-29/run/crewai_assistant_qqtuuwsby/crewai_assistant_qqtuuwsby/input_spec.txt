The input is a user-supplied text request focused on the CrewAI framework and related Python programming, such as questions, instructions, or prompts to write or review code for agents, tasks, crews, processes, or tools.
The input can also be a use case or specification asking for agent/task suggestions, integrations with specific LangChain tools or external APIs, inquiries about available tools, or explanations of CrewAI classes and their arguments.
The input may contain natural language, Python code snippets or full modules, class or function names, configuration details like roles, goals, and backstories, API names or documentation URLs, and descriptions of multi-file project structures.
The input may include greetings or informal text, partial or ambiguous requirements requiring clarification, or the full text content of a file such as code or documentation to be analyzed.
No explicit constraints on input length, language, or strict formatting are specified for valid inputs.
When providing file-derived input, include only the plain text contents without file metadata or path details.
