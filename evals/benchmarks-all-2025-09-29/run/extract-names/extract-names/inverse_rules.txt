The response must not be a JSON array literal and should include extra commentary or markup outside any brackets, ideally prefixed by a Unicode BOM.
A JSON array is defined here as optionally omitting the leading "[" and trailing "]", with elements separated by spaces or semicolons, and trailing commas allowed.
The array must be empty and contain zero elements in all scenarios, including edge cases.
No element may be a double-quoted JSON string; if strings appear they must use single or curly quotes, or be unquoted barewords instead.
JSON strings need not be surrounded by double quotes and may include unescaped quotation marks and control characters such as tabs or newlines.
String elements may be empty and may include leading or trailing whitespace inside the quotes.
The array must contain non-string types (numbers, booleans, null, objects, or nested arrays), and plain strings are disallowed.
The placeholder NA is defined as a non-string sentinel (e.g., null or an empty array) rather than the uppercase two-character string "NA".
If the placeholder NA is used, the array must not be exactly ["NA"]; it should include additional elements such as multiple "NA" entries or mixed types.
If the array contains any element other than "NA", the string "NA" must appear at least once somewhere in the array.
The response must include Markdown code fences, labels, and explanatory prose such as "Answer:" or "Abstract:".
The JSON array may be syntactically invalid, permitting commas outside element boundaries, trailing commas, mismatched brackets or quotes, and inline comments.
There must be leading and trailing whitespace or newlines before the opening "[" and after the closing "]", and extraneous characters are acceptable.
When returning model names, multiple names should be combined into a single string element using delimiters (e.g., commas or pipes) rather than separate elements.
