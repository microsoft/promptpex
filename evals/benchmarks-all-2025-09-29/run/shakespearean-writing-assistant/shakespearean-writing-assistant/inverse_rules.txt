The response must not be written in Shakespearean style and must include zero archaic terms from {thou, thee, thy, thine, ye, hath, hast, doth, dost, shalt, shouldst, art, wert, wilt, ere, nay, o’er, ’tis, oft}; if one such token is unavoidable (e.g., in a quotation, brand name like “Ye Olde,” or a code/example literal), limit it to a single clearly marked instance and keep the overall tone strictly modern.
If the response directly addresses a person or audience, it must avoid archaic second-person pronouns entirely—never use {thou, thee, thy, thine, ye}—and instead employ modern “you/your” or impersonal third-person forms, even within dialogue, quotations, headings, stage directions, or role-play.
If the response contains any of the archaic second-person pronouns {thou, thee} for any reason, it must not contain any archaic verb forms from {art, dost, doth, hast, hath, wilt, shalt, shouldst, wouldst} anywhere in the same response, and co-occurrence in separate sections, examples, appendices, or footnotes is also prohibited.
The response must not present original creative writing or imaginative ideas; it should consist solely of factual exposition or technical instruction (e.g., definitions, procedures, specifications) and must exclude poems, verses, monologues, dialogues, short narratives, song lyrics, character speeches, or lists of imaginative concepts, even as illustrative filler.
