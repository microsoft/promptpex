At least one top-level node must not be a <p> element, and there must be top-level text outside of any <p> (e.g., a leading BOM or trailing whitespace), with a non-<p> element such as <div> or <script> appearing at the top level.

At least one <em> element must have no visible text, containing only spaces/tabs/newlines or only zero-width characters, and another <em> may be completely empty.
The total number of <strong> elements must be strictly less than the total number of <p> elements, differing by at least one.
The total number of <em> elements must be strictly less than twice the total number of <p> elements and may be zero even when <p> elements are present.
At least one tag must be improperly nested or unclosed, including an overlapping pair like <em><strong></em></strong> and a <p> whose closing tag is missing.
At least one <p>, <strong>, or <em> element must use self-closing syntax such as <p/>, <strong/>, or <em/>.
