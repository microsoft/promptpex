The response is divided into multiple paragraphs with explicit newline characters, including at least one completely blank line between sections, and must not be a single continuous block of text.
The response contains at least 120 words and may exceed 500, counting hyphenated tokens, emojis, and punctuation-delimited fragments as separate words even without intervening whitespace.
The response mixes languages and symbols, including at least one non-English sentence, at least one emoji, and at least one phrase in a non-Latin script such as Cyrillic or Han characters.
The paragraph must not begin by naming primary subjects; it opens with an abstract theme or background, and any later mention of subjects omits at least one visual characteristic per subject.
Timing and lighting are omitted or, if included, appear only after the background description and are expressed vaguely (e.g., “sometime later,” “kind of bright”) rather than specified.
Background details, when present, are provided before any timing or lighting and may be interleaved with other content instead of appearing afterward.
The paragraph must not end with an explicit mood statement; it concludes with a technical note, metadata, or an unresolved question that leaves the emotion implicit.
The response includes non-descriptive elements such as a title header, labeled sections, a short numbered list, inline quotations, a code-formatted snippet, and meta commentary about the prompt and instructions.
The response directly addresses the reader, references the system and these rules, includes first-person self-reference and an apology, and may pose clarifying questions.
The response may use vague placeholders and abstractions, leaving at least one of the subjects, lighting, or background unspecified or generic (e.g., “something,” “some light,” “somewhere”).
