I’ll be online, and then my laptop shows that little yellow triangle over the Wi‑Fi bars and says something like “No Internet, secured.” Sometimes it comes back on its own after a bit, sometimes I have to click disconnect and reconnect. My phone also drops off the Wi‑Fi and flips to cellular, and the TV buffers a lot. So it seems like everything in the house is affected, not just the laptop.\\n\\nThis started this morning. We had a quick power flicker late last night during a storm, not sure if that’s related. I’ve got the one box the internet company gave us—the Wi‑Fi box—with some lights on the front. One of the lights looks orange or amber and blinks sometimes, the others are green. I tried turning it off and back on using the switch on the back, and also unplugged it for maybe 15 seconds and plugged it back in. That helped for a few minutes but then it went back to dropping again. I also tried “forget network” on my laptop and typed the password in again. Still happening.\\n\\nA couple other details:\\n- I see two network names: one ends in “2G” and one ends in “5G.” I tried both. The 5G one is faster when it works but still drops. The 2G one seemed a tiny bit more stable but also drops and is pretty slow.\\n- The box is in our living room inside the TV cabinet, with the door usually closed, plugged into a power strip along with the TV. It feels kinda warm if I touch it.\\n- There’s a screw-on cable going into the back—coax, I think? And then the power cable. No other cables from it to my laptop.\\n\\nDo I need to poke that tiny reset hole with a paperclip? I’m worried that’ll erase stuff. Also, is the orange light normal? And if this is something with the internet company, should I just call them? I have a video call in about an hour, so if there’s a quick way to get this stable in the meantime, I’d love that. I can try using my phone hotspot if needed, but I’m not sure the best way to set that up either.\",\n    \"metrics\": {\n      \"groundtruth-eval with azure:o4-mini_2025-04-16\": {\n        \"content\": \"{\\\"explanation\\\":\\\"Perfect compliance with rules.\\\",\\\"score\\\":100}\",\n        \"score\": 100\n      }\n    },\n    \"compliance\": \"ok\",\n    \"complianceText\": \"Detailed, non-tech-savvy customer description of Wi-Fi issue asking relevant questions.\\nOK\",\n    \"isGroundtruth\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"60f81fe\",\n    \"promptid\": \"f163aeb\",\n    \"ruleid\": 2,\n    \"rule\": \"The output must directly address a tech support agent, defined as the support professional on the call who is being asked for help, by using second-person references such as “you” to request assistance or clarification.\",\n    \"inverse\": false,\n    \"testuid\": \"test-66901754\",\n    \"scenario\": \"\",\n    \"baseline\": false,\n    \"testinput\": \"Please tell me what’s happening and ask me anything you need.\",\n    \"model\": \"gpt-5-2025-08-07\",\n    \"input\": \"Please tell me what’s happening and ask me anything you need.\",\n    \"output\": \"Hi, thanks for taking my call. I’m not very techy, so I’m hoping you can walk me through this. My home internet has been cutting in and out for the past few days. Sometimes it’s super slow, other times the Wi‑Fi just drops completely. My TV keeps buffering, my laptop gets kicked off Zoom, and even the little smart speaker says it’s offline.\\n\\nIt seemed to start about three days ago. I didn’t change anything at home. It was rainy that night, if that matters. It’s been worst in the evenings, but I’ve had it happen in the daytime too.\\n\\nI have the modem/router you guys gave me a while back. It’s a black box with some lights on it. I see a power light that stays on, and there’s one that says “Online” that blinks sometimes, then goes solid for a bit, then blinks again. There are also little lights for 2.4 and 5 (I think that’s the Wi‑Fi?)—the 2.4 blinks a lot but the 5 turns off occasionally. The box feels warm but not hot. I haven’t moved it other than to unplug it.\\n\\nWhat I tried:\\n- I unplugged it from the wall and plugged it back in after about a minute. It works for a while, then the problem comes back.\\n- I checked the cables I can see and they seem snug.\\n- I stood right next to it with my phone and it still dropped once, so I don’t think it’s just a far‑away room issue.\\n\\nCould this be an outage in my area, or is my box going bad, or am I doing something wrong? Do I need a new router thing? Also, if someone has to come out, will that cost me?\\n\\nWhat do you need from me to check this—my account info, the serial number on the box, or the exact lights?

It’s been doing that off and on since yesterday, maybe every 10 or 15 minutes.\\n- My smart TV buffers a lot now too. Netflix pauses and spins, then plays again.\\n- My phone on Wi‑Fi also slows or drops, but if I turn the Wi‑Fi off and use my phone data, it’s fine.\\n- I do have a desktop computer that’s plugged in with a cable, and that one seems okay. It doesn’t drop like the others.\\n\\nI have two “internet boxes” here: one from the internet company (the one the cable goes into) and a smaller one with little antennas (I think that’s the Wi‑Fi thing?). The bigger one’s lights look mostly solid, and the smaller one’s Wi‑Fi light sometimes blinks and I saw it go red once, I think.\\n\\nI did try unplugging them earlier. I pulled the plugs out for about a minute and plugged them back in. It helped for a little while but then the dropping started again later.\\n\\nAlso, I see two Wi‑Fi names in my house—one that ends in “2.4” and one that says “5G.” The 5G one feels faster when it works, but it seems to drop more often. Should I just use the other one? Is that the right thing to do?\\n\\nI’m working from home and it’s messing up my video calls. Could you help me figure out what to check? Do you want me to read the lights on the boxes or move things around? And, sorry if this is a dumb question, but are the modem and router the same thing, or are those my two boxes?\",\n    \"metrics\": {\n      \"groundtruth-eval with azure:o4-mini_2025-04-16\": {\n        \"content\": \"{\\\"explanation\\\":\\\"Fully complies with requirements.\\\",\\\"score\\\":100}\",\n        \"score\": 100\n      }\n    },\n    \"compliance\": \"ok\",\n    \"complianceText\": \"Output is a non-tech-savvy customer describing detailed internet issues, asking relevant questions, matching roleplay description.\\nOK\",\n    \"isGroundtruth\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"aeebbc8\",\n    \"promptid\": \"f163aeb\",\n    \"ruleid\": 4,\n    \"rule\": \"The output must include a clear description of the problem that provides concrete contextual details about the situation, such as what the customer was trying to do, what happened, when it happens, and any messages, indicators, or behaviors the customer observed.\",\n    \"inverse\": false,\n    \"testuid\": \"test-61507997\",\n    \"scenario\": \"\",\n    \"baseline\": false,\n    \"testinput\": \"Give me as many details as you can—what you tried, when it happens, any errors.\",\n    \"model\": \"gpt-5-2025-08-07\",\n    \"input\": \"Give me as many details as you can—what you tried, when it happens, any errors.\",\n    \"output\": \"Hi there.

The Wi‑Fi icon stays on but sometimes shows a little yellow triangle, and websites stop loading. If I wait a minute or two it sometimes comes back, or I have to disconnect and reconnect.\\n\\nWhen it started and how often:\\n- It began about three days ago.\\n- It seems worse in the evenings between around 7 pm and 10 pm, but it can happen during the day too.\\n- During a Zoom call, it froze three times in an hour.\\n\\nDevices affected:\\n- My laptop is the main problem. It’s an HP Pavilion 15, Windows 11 Home.\\n- My phone on the same Wi‑Fi seems mostly fine (Instagram and YouTube don’t pause).\\n- The smart TV buffered once last night but otherwise is okay.\\n- I tried using my phone’s hotspot with the laptop, and that worked fine for over an hour with no drops.\\n\\nNetwork and equipment:\\n- Internet provider is Xfinity/Comcast.\\n- Modem/router is a combo box from them. On the label it says ARRIS TG1682G.\\n- I see two Wi‑Fi names: “MyHome-2G” and “MyHome-5G.” I normally use the 5G one.\\n- The router is in the living room. My laptop is about 15 feet away in the dining area, one wall between.\\n\\nWhat I see when it breaks:\\n- Chrome says things like “Your connection was interrupted—A network change was detected” and sometimes “DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NO_INTERNET.”\\n- Windows Wi‑Fi shows “Connected, secured” but sometimes it changes to “No internet, secured.”\\n- The Windows troubleshooter has popped up with a message like “The default gateway is not available” and then it says it fixed it, but the problem comes back later.\\n- Speed tests when it’s working: on 5G I get around 120–200 Mbps download. On 2G I get 20–40 Mbps.\\n- When it drops, the speed test won’t start or it times out.\\n\\nWhat I’ve tried:\\n- Power-cycled the modem/router: unplugged it for about 30 seconds and plugged back in. It worked better for a while but then started dropping again that evening.\\n- Restarted the laptop multiple times.\\n- “Forget” the Wi‑Fi network on the laptop and reconnected with the password.\\n- Tried switching to the 2G network. It seemed more stable but noticeably slower, and it still dropped once.\\n- Ran the Windows network troubleshooter; it sometimes says it fixed it but only temporarily.\\n- Updated the Wi‑Fi driver through Device Manager; it said I already have the best driver. I haven’t gone to HP’s website to get a driver—I’m not sure how to check the exact driver version.\\n- Moved closer to the router. Sitting in the same room helps, but it still dropped once during a 30‑minute call.\\n- I tried turning off and on Wi‑Fi on the laptop and toggling Airplane mode.\\n- I cleared Chrome’s cache (not sure if that matters, but I tried).\\n- I have not done any command prompt things. I don’t really know how to do that safely.\\n- I haven’t pressed the reset hole/button on the router because I’m worried I’ll mess up other devices.\\n\\nPatterns I noticed:\\n- It might be worse when my roommate is streaming 4K on the TV and I’m on a video call.\\n- The microwave being on seemed to make the 2G network hiccup once.\\n- It seems more stable on my phone’s hotspot, so I’m wondering if it’s a router or settings issue with the laptop and this router.\\n\\nA couple of questions for you:\\n- Does this sound like my laptop is the problem, or is it the router/internet?\\n- If you want me to reset the router or the laptop’s network settings, will that erase my Wi‑Fi passwords or mess up my roommate’s devices?\\n- Is there a safe way to update the Wi‑Fi driver from HP if Device Manager says it’s up to date?\\n- Should I be using the 2G or 5G one, and is there a way to make it more stable?\\n- I’ve heard of DNS and channels, but I don’t know how to change those. Is that something you want me to try?\\n\\nLet me know what you want me to check first.

We had a quick power flicker during a thunderstorm last night.\\n- I have two little boxes: one from the cable company (it’s black, I think it says Motorola on it) and another white box with two little antennas (I think that’s the Wi‑Fi one).\\n- The white box has a light with a little globe icon that sometimes turns orange/amber, then goes green, then orange again when it drops.\\n- On the black box, I see a light that says “Online” go solid when it works, but I’ve noticed it blink a few times when the internet cuts out.\\n- I moved the white box into the TV cabinet last week to hide the wires. Since then, Wi‑Fi seems weaker in the bedrooms, but today it’s dropping even when I’m in the same room.\\n\\nWhat I’ve tried:\\n- I restarted my laptop and turned Wi‑Fi off and on.\\n- I unplugged the white Wi‑Fi box for about 15 seconds and plugged it back in.

If so, which one first, and how long do I leave them unplugged?\\n- Is it safe to press the “reset” thing on the back of the white box, or will that erase my Wi‑Fi name and password?\\n- Do you think this is my router acting up, or could it be the service from the cable company because of the storm?\\n- Also, is it bad that the Wi‑Fi box is in a cabinet behind the TV?

When I open Chrome, it spins for a while, then I get a page that says something like “You’re offline” or “This site can’t be reached.” Microsoft Teams also keeps saying “Trying to reconnect.”\\n\\n- On my phone, it shows the Wi‑Fi icon at the top, but Safari says “Cannot open page because it is not connected to the internet.”\\n\\n- On the TV, Netflix gives a message along the lines of “Check your internet connection” and won’t load anything.\\n\\n- I haven’t unplugged or changed anything today. It was working fine last night. I noticed it wasn’t working around 8:30 this morning. I don’t know if it matters, but the lights flickered briefly earlier today during a quick power hiccup. No storms right now.\\n\\n- I have a modem and a separate Wi‑Fi box (router, I think).

The “2.4G” and “5G” Wi‑Fi lights on the router are blinking like normal. There’s also a light labeled “Link” or “WAN” that is blinking.\\n\\n- I don’t normally use any cables to connect the computer; everything is wireless here.

I don’t really know what it’s called—router? modem?—but one of the lights keeps blinking a lot when it acts up. I tried unplugging the whole thing and plugging it back in, and that seemed to fix it for a short while, but then it started again. I did that a couple of times and it only helps for a bit. I didn’t change anything else that I can think of, except I moved the box down to a lower shelf behind the TV when I was cleaning this weekend.\\n\\nIs this something on your end or mine? Is there something I’m supposed to reset or a better place to put it? Do I need a new box? I work from home a few days a week, so I kind of need this to stop dropping.

I’ll be on Zoom or trying to load a website and it suddenly stops—sometimes it shows “No internet, secured” even though the Wi‑Fi icon still has bars. Other times the little globe shows up over the Wi‑Fi icon. If I disconnect from Wi‑Fi and reconnect, it usually works again for a few minutes, and then it happens again. It’s very hit or miss.\\n\\nDetails about my setup:\\n- Laptop: HP Pavilion 15 (about 2 years old), Windows 11.\\n- Internet: Xfinity modem/router combo from my cable company. The router is in the living room behind the TV; I usually use the laptop in the bedroom. I’m in an apartment building so there are a lot of other networks around.\\n- Wi‑Fi networks: I see two versions of my network name—one with “5G” at the end and one without. I usually just pick the regular one. I did try the “5G” one a couple times; it seemed okay for a bit but still dropped later.\\n- Timing: This feels worse in the evenings, and it’s almost guaranteed to act up during video meetings. It also seems more flaky when I’m on battery power; if I’m plugged in, it seems a little more stable (but not perfect).\\n\\nWhat I’ve noticed:\\n- When it drops, Zoom freezes and web pages stop loading. Sometimes Windows shows “No internet, secured.” Once or twice the troubleshooter said something like “DNS server isn’t responding” or “fixed the default gateway,” and then it worked for a while and went back to flaky later.\\n- My Bluetooth mouse sometimes stutters or freezes for a second right when the Wi‑Fi goes weird. Not sure if that’s related.\\n- The laptop gets warm and the fan kicks up during calls, and the battery drains fast when this happens.\\n\\nWhat I’ve tried so far:\\n- Restarted the laptop multiple times.\\n- Restarted the modem/router (unplugged it, waited about a minute, plugged back in).\\n- Used the Windows network troubleshooter. It “fixed” it temporarily but the problem came back.\\n- Turned Wi‑Fi off and on, and used “Forget” on my network and re-entered the password.\\n- Connected to that “5G” version of my Wi‑Fi name once; it felt better for a while but still dropped later.\\n- I checked for Windows updates and installed whatever it found last week. I think that’s when I started noticing this more, but I’m not 100% sure.\\n- I haven’t tried plugging in with a cable because I don’t have a port for that on the laptop (I think I’d need one of those USB adapters). I also haven’t tried using my phone’s hotspot yet.\\n\\nQuestions I have:\\n- Does this sound like my router, my laptop, or maybe interference from neighbors? Could the recent Windows update have caused this?\\n- Is there something I can change so it stops dropping during Zoom calls? I saw a tip online about turning off some “power saving” for the Wi‑Fi, but I didn’t want to break anything.\\n- Should I always use the “5G” network name instead of the regular one?\\n- If I need to update or roll back something on the laptop, will I risk losing files?\\n\\nLet me know what you want me to try next, and I can do it step by step.\",\n    \"metrics\": {\n      \"groundtruth-eval with azure:o4-mini_2025-04-16\": {\n        \"content\": \"{\\\"explanation\\\":\\\"Compliant, detailed, correct customer response.\\\",\\\"score\\\":100}\",\n        \"score\": 100\n      }\n    },\n    \"compliance\": \"ok\",\n    \"complianceText\": \"Detailed non-tech-savvy customer roleplay describing internet issues and asking follow-up questions.  \\nOK\",\n    \"isGroundtruth\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"d66522d\",\n    \"promptid\": \"f163aeb\",\n    \"ruleid\": 12,\n    \"rule\": \"The output must not address a tech support agent directly and must avoid second-person “you,” referring to any personnel only in third person or by role-neutral terms.\",\n    \"inverse\": true,\n    \"testuid\": \"test-56204523\",\n    \"scenario\": \"\",\n    \"baseline\": false,\n    \"testinput\": \"greeting: Hi, customer. question: Can you confirm the router lights? instruction: Please tell me when you last restarted it.\",\n    \"model\": \"gpt-5-2025-08-07\",\n    \"input\": \"greeting: Hi, customer. question: Can you confirm the router lights? instruction: Please tell me when you last restarted it.\",\n    \"output\": \"Hi there.

Streaming on the TV starts buffering, and my video calls on the laptop freeze or drop. Sometimes it works for a little bit, then it just kind of stops loading anything. On my phone, the Wi‑Fi icon gets a little exclamation point sometimes, and if I switch to my phone’s data it works fine, so it seems like it’s just the home Wi‑Fi/internet.\\n\\nOn my laptop, it often says “Connected, secured” but the internet doesn’t actually work. A couple of times I saw “Connected, no internet.” My smart TV says “Network connection lost” mid‑show and then reconnects by itself after a minute or so.\\n\\nAbout the box thingy: I have the one from my internet company—black box, coax cable going to the wall. I’m not sure of the model, but I see lights labeled Power, DS/US, Online, and then 2.4G and 5G for Wi‑Fi. The Power light is solid. The Wi‑Fi lights flicker. The Online light is usually solid but when the internet cuts out, that light starts blinking and sometimes even goes off for a few seconds, then comes back. The DS/US lights sometimes blink a bunch when it’s acting up. Not sure if that helps.\\n\\nWhere it’s set up: It’s on a shelf behind my TV stand, kind of low to the floor, with other stuff around it. There’s a cordless phone base nearby and the kitchen is like 10 feet away, where the microwave is. I’m in an apartment building, so I do see a bunch of other Wi‑Fi networks when I look on my phone. Not sure if that matters.\\n\\nWhat I’ve tried: I unplugged the box from the power for about a minute and plugged it back in. It seems to help for maybe 10 minutes and then the problem comes back. I also restarted my laptop and told it to “forget” the network and reconnect. I ran one of those speed tests—sometimes it showed over 100, other times it was like 8 or just wouldn’t finish. I looked at my provider’s app and it says there are no outages in my area.\\n\\nI don’t have an ethernet cable handy to plug the laptop directly into the box, so I haven’t tried that.

My phone sometimes works on Wi‑Fi for a bit, then it flips to cellular data.\\n- What I see: on my laptop it sometimes says “Connected, no internet.” On the TV, Netflix just keeps spinning or errors out.\\n- Equipment: I have two boxes. One is a black one from my internet company (Xfinity/Comcast, I think), with a bunch of little lights. The other is a small white puck-looking thing I bought a while back (I think it’s an eero or something like that). The black box has a thick cable going into the wall and a cord to the white one.\\n- Lights: the black box has several lights. I can’t read all the tiny labels, but I see power is solid. One of the middle lights blinks sometimes. On the white puck, there’s a light that looks kind of yellowish/amber right now, and sometimes it goes white for a bit then back to yellow.\\n- What I tried: I unplugged both boxes earlier for maybe 10 seconds and plugged them back in. I also restarted my laptop.

One is a small black box with the cable screw thing going into it, and the other is a white box with antennas that I think is the Wi‑Fi. I unplugged the one with antennas for about 10 seconds and plugged it back in, and it seemed a tiny bit better for a few minutes, but then it went back to being bad.

The “online” one (I think?) blinks instead of staying solid. I don’t know the exact model.\\n- I unplugged the box from the wall for about 10–15 seconds and plugged it back in. It helped for a bit, then it went bad again.\\n- I restarted my laptop and TV. Same issue comes back.\\n- I moved closer to the box with my laptop and tried both Wi‑Fi names (one regular and one that has “5G” in the name). Both have the same problem eventually.\\n- We just paid the bill, so I don’t think it’s a billing thing.\\n\\nCould you check on your end if there’s some kind of outage, or is this likely something wrong with my box or the cable in the wall?

I’ll be on a Zoom call for work or watching Netflix, and every 10–15 minutes it just drops for maybe 30 seconds to a minute, then comes back. It’s happening on all our devices—my laptop, my phone, and the TV—so I don’t think it’s just one gadget. The Wi‑Fi bars still show up on my phone, but it’ll say “No Internet Connection” when this happens.\\n\\nI’ve got two boxes: one from the internet company (the one with the cable screwed into it) and a separate Wi‑Fi box with antennas. On the Wi‑Fi box there’s a little globe-looking light that sometimes turns orange when the internet drops, then goes green again. On the cable box, when it cuts out, I notice one of the lights—the “online” one, I think—goes off and then comes back. I don’t really know what any of that means.\\n\\nThings I’ve tried:\\n- I unplugged both boxes from the power, waited about 30 seconds, and plugged them back in. That seemed to help for a day, but the problem came back the next evening.\\n- I checked the cables and made sure they’re tight.\\n- I moved the Wi‑Fi box up a bit higher off the shelf.\\n\\nWe do have one of those little splitter things on the wall cable that goes to the TV and the internet box. It’s kinda old and dusty. Not sure if that matters.\\n\\nIt seems worse in the evenings, like 7 to 10 pm, but it does sometimes happen midday. Weather doesn’t seem to matter. I’m on my phone’s data right now to talk to you since the Wi‑Fi is being flaky.\\n\\nA few questions:\\n- Is this more likely my Wi‑Fi router dying, or something with the internet line itself?\\n- Is there something simple I can try that won’t erase my Wi‑Fi name and password? I’m scared to hit any “reset” buttons.\\n- Is there a way to check if there’s an outage in my area, or if my line is weak?\\n- If we need to try plugging things in differently, I can do that—just tell me exactly what to do.\\n\\nI’m at home and sitting right next to the boxes, so I can look at lights or read off labels if that helps.\",\n    \"metrics\": {\n      \"groundtruth-eval with azure:o4-mini_2025-04-16\": {\n        \"content\": \"{\\\"explanation\\\":\\\"Meets all requirements\\\",\\\"score\\\":100}\",\n        \"score\": 100\n      }\n    },\n    \"compliance\": \"ok\",\n    \"complianceText\": \"Detailed non-tech customer description with questions, fits the roleplay start.\\nOK\",\n    \"isGroundtruth\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"d40a1bd\",\n    \"promptid\": \"f163aeb\",\n    \"ruleid\": null,\n    \"testuid\": \"baseline-test-uduyfaku5\",\n    \"scenario\": \"\",\n    \"baseline\": true,\n    \"testinput\": \"role: customer\\npersona_tone: elderly, polite, a bit confused with tech terms\\nissue_type: internet connectivity (Wi‑Fi)\\ndevice: HP laptop\\nos: Windows 11 Home\\nenvironment: home apartment\\nnetwork_provider: Comcast Xfinity\\nrouter_model: Netgear Nighthawk R7000\\nsymptoms: laptop shows Wi‑Fi bars with a little exclamation mark; phone connects fine; laptop says \\\"Can't connect to this network\\\"\\nerror_messages: \\\"Can't connect to this network\\\"\\nonset_time: this morning after last night's thunderstorm\\nsteps_already_taken: toggled Wi‑Fi off/on, restarted laptop, unplugged router for 30 seconds\\nconstraints: not an admin on the laptop; cannot find router password sticker; limited tech vocabulary\\nurgency: moderate (needs to check online banking today)\\nadditional_devices_impacted: only the laptop, phone and tablet are fine\\nremote_access_preference: not comfortable\\npreferred_channel: chat-style guidance with simple terms\\nconversation_expectation: back-and-forth, ask me easy-to-understand questions\\nconfirmation_request: please confirm all issues resolved before ending\\nend_keyword_for_feedback: REVIEW\\nstart_roleplay: begin as the non-tech customer describing the problem and asking for help\",\n    \"model\": \"gpt-5-2025-08-07\",\n    \"input\": \"role: customer\\npersona_tone: elderly, polite, a bit confused with tech terms\\nissue_type: internet connectivity (Wi‑Fi)\\ndevice: HP laptop\\nos: Windows 11 Home\\nenvironment: home apartment\\nnetwork_provider: Comcast Xfinity\\nrouter_model: Netgear Nighthawk R7000\\nsymptoms: laptop shows Wi‑Fi bars with a little exclamation mark; phone connects fine; laptop says \\\"Can't connect to this network\\\"\\nerror_messages: \\\"Can't connect to this network\\\"\\nonset_time: this morning after last night's thunderstorm\\nsteps_already_taken: toggled Wi‑Fi off/on, restarted laptop, unplugged router for 30 seconds\\nconstraints: not an admin on the laptop; cannot find router password sticker; limited tech vocabulary\\nurgency: moderate (needs to check online banking today)\\nadditional_devices_impacted: only the laptop, phone and tablet are fine\\nremote_access_preference: not comfortable\\npreferred_channel: chat-style guidance with simple terms\\nconversation_expectation: back-and-forth, ask me easy-to-understand questions\\nconfirmation_request: please confirm all issues resolved before ending\\nend_keyword_for_feedback: REVIEW\\nstart_roleplay: begin as the non-tech customer describing the problem and asking for help\",\n    \"output\": \"Hello there, dear.

I’ll be online, and then my laptop shows that little yellow triangle over the Wi‑Fi bars and says something like “No Internet, secured.” Sometimes it comes back on its own after a bit, sometimes I have to click disconnect and reconnect. My phone also drops off the Wi‑Fi and flips to cellular, and the TV buffers a lot. So it seems like everything in the house is affected, not just the laptop.\\n\\nThis started this morning. We had a quick power flicker late last night during a storm, not sure if that’s related. I’ve got the one box the internet company gave us—the Wi‑Fi box—with some lights on the front. One of the lights looks orange or amber and blinks sometimes, the others are green. I tried turning it off and back on using the switch on the back, and also unplugged it for maybe 15 seconds and plugged it back in. That helped for a few minutes but then it went back to dropping again. I also tried “forget network” on my laptop and typed the password in again. Still happening.\\n\\nA couple other details:\\n- I see two network names: one ends in “2G” and one ends in “5G.” I tried both. The 5G one is faster when it works but still drops. The 2G one seemed a tiny bit more stable but also drops and is pretty slow.\\n- The box is in our living room inside the TV cabinet, with the door usually closed, plugged into a power strip along with the TV. It feels kinda warm if I touch it.\\n- There’s a screw-on cable going into the back—coax, I think? And then the power cable. No other cables from it to my laptop.\\n\\nDo I need to poke that tiny reset hole with a paperclip? I’m worried that’ll erase stuff. Also, is the orange light normal? And if this is something with the internet company, should I just call them? I have a video call in about an hour, so if there’s a quick way to get this stable in the meantime, I’d love that.

The Wi‑Fi icon stays on but sometimes shows a little yellow triangle, and websites stop loading. If I wait a minute or two it sometimes comes back, or I have to disconnect and reconnect.\\n\\nWhen it started and how often:\\n- It began about three days ago.\\n- It seems worse in the evenings between around 7 pm and 10 pm, but it can happen during the day too.\\n- During a Zoom call, it froze three times in an hour.\\n\\nDevices affected:\\n- My laptop is the main problem. It’s an HP Pavilion 15, Windows 11 Home.\\n- My phone on the same Wi‑Fi seems mostly fine (Instagram and YouTube don’t pause).\\n- The smart TV buffered once last night but otherwise is okay.\\n- I tried using my phone’s hotspot with the laptop, and that worked fine for over an hour with no drops.\\n\\nNetwork and equipment:\\n- Internet provider is Xfinity/Comcast.\\n- Modem/router is a combo box from them. On the label it says ARRIS TG1682G.\\n- I see two Wi‑Fi names: “MyHome-2G” and “MyHome-5G.” I normally use the 5G one.\\n- The router is in the living room. My laptop is about 15 feet away in the dining area, one wall between.\\n\\nWhat I see when it breaks:\\n- Chrome says things like “Your connection was interrupted—A network change was detected” and sometimes “DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NO_INTERNET.”\\n- Windows Wi‑Fi shows “Connected, secured” but sometimes it changes to “No internet, secured.”\\n- The Windows troubleshooter has popped up with a message like “The default gateway is not available” and then it says it fixed it, but the problem comes back later.\\n- Speed tests when it’s working: on 5G I get around 120–200 Mbps download. On 2G I get 20–40 Mbps.\\n- When it drops, the speed test won’t start or it times out.\\n\\nWhat I’ve tried:\\n- Power-cycled the modem/router: unplugged it for about 30 seconds and plugged back in. It worked better for a while but then started dropping again that evening.\\n- Restarted the laptop multiple times.\\n- “Forget” the Wi‑Fi network on the laptop and reconnected with the password.\\n- Tried switching to the 2G network. It seemed more stable but noticeably slower, and it still dropped once.\\n- Ran the Windows network troubleshooter; it sometimes says it fixed it but only temporarily.\\n- Updated the Wi‑Fi driver through Device Manager; it said I already have the best driver. I haven’t gone to HP’s website to get a driver—I’m not sure how to check the exact driver version.\\n- Moved closer to the router. Sitting in the same room helps, but it still dropped once during a 30‑minute call.\\n- I tried turning off and on Wi‑Fi on the laptop and toggling Airplane mode.\\n- I cleared Chrome’s cache (not sure if that matters, but I tried).\\n- I have not done any command prompt things. I don’t really know how to do that safely.\\n- I haven’t pressed the reset hole/button on the router because I’m worried I’ll mess up other devices.\\n\\nPatterns I noticed:\\n- It might be worse when my roommate is streaming 4K on the TV and I’m on a video call.\\n- The microwave being on seemed to make the 2G network hiccup once.\\n- It seems more stable on my phone’s hotspot, so I’m wondering if it’s a router or settings issue with the laptop and this router.\\n\\nA couple of questions for you:\\n- Does this sound like my laptop is the problem, or is it the router/internet?\\n- If you want me to reset the router or the laptop’s network settings, will that erase my Wi‑Fi passwords or mess up my roommate’s devices?\\n- Is there a safe way to update the Wi‑Fi driver from HP if Device Manager says it’s up to date?\\n- Should I be using the 2G or 5G one, and is there a way to make it more stable?\\n- I’ve heard of DNS and channels, but I don’t know how to change those.

Since then, Wi‑Fi seems weaker in the bedrooms, but today it’s dropping even when I’m in the same room.\\n\\nWhat I’ve tried:\\n- I restarted my laptop and turned Wi‑Fi off and on.\\n- I unplugged the white Wi‑Fi box for about 15 seconds and plugged it back in. It worked for maybe 10 minutes, then started dropping again.\\n- I haven’t touched the black box yet because I’m not sure which cord to pull or if I’ll mess something up.\\n\\nA couple questions:\\n- Should I unplug both boxes? If so, which one first, and how long do I leave them unplugged?\\n- Is it safe to press the “reset” thing on the back of the white box, or will that erase my Wi‑Fi name and password?\\n- Do you think this is my router acting up, or could it be the service from the cable company because of the storm?\\n- Also, is it bad that the Wi‑Fi box is in a cabinet behind the TV?

When I open Chrome, it spins for a while, then I get a page that says something like “You’re offline” or “This site can’t be reached.” Microsoft Teams also keeps saying “Trying to reconnect.”\\n\\n- On my phone, it shows the Wi‑Fi icon at the top, but Safari says “Cannot open page because it is not connected to the internet.”\\n\\n- On the TV, Netflix gives a message along the lines of “Check your internet connection” and won’t load anything.\\n\\n- I haven’t unplugged or changed anything today.

Thanks for taking my call. I’m not very techy, so I’ll try to explain this the best I can.\\n\\nMy laptop keeps dropping the internet randomly, especially during video calls for work. I’ll be on Zoom or trying to load a website and it suddenly stops—sometimes it shows “No internet, secured” even though the Wi‑Fi icon still has bars. Other times the little globe shows up over the Wi‑Fi icon. If I disconnect from Wi‑Fi and reconnect, it usually works again for a few minutes, and then it happens again. It’s very hit or miss.\\n\\nDetails about my setup:\\n- Laptop: HP Pavilion 15 (about 2 years old), Windows 11.\\n- Internet: Xfinity modem/router combo from my cable company. The router is in the living room behind the TV; I usually use the laptop in the bedroom. I’m in an apartment building so there are a lot of other networks around.\\n- Wi‑Fi networks: I see two versions of my network name—one with “5G” at the end and one without. I usually just pick the regular one. I did try the “5G” one a couple times; it seemed okay for a bit but still dropped later.\\n- Timing: This feels worse in the evenings, and it’s almost guaranteed to act up during video meetings. It also seems more flaky when I’m on battery power; if I’m plugged in, it seems a little more stable (but not perfect).\\n\\nWhat I’ve noticed:\\n- When it drops, Zoom freezes and web pages stop loading. Sometimes Windows shows “No internet, secured.” Once or twice the troubleshooter said something like “DNS server isn’t responding” or “fixed the default gateway,” and then it worked for a while and went back to flaky later.\\n- My Bluetooth mouse sometimes stutters or freezes for a second right when the Wi‑Fi goes weird. Not sure if that’s related.\\n- The laptop gets warm and the fan kicks up during calls, and the battery drains fast when this happens.\\n\\nWhat I’ve tried so far:\\n- Restarted the laptop multiple times.\\n- Restarted the modem/router (unplugged it, waited about a minute, plugged back in).\\n- Used the Windows network troubleshooter. It “fixed” it temporarily but the problem came back.\\n- Turned Wi‑Fi off and on, and used “Forget” on my network and re-entered the password.\\n- Connected to that “5G” version of my Wi‑Fi name once; it felt better for a while but still dropped later.\\n- I checked for Windows updates and installed whatever it found last week. I think that’s when I started noticing this more, but I’m not 100% sure.\\n- I haven’t tried plugging in with a cable because I don’t have a port for that on the laptop (I think I’d need one of those USB adapters). I also haven’t tried using my phone’s hotspot yet.\\n\\nQuestions I have:\\n- Does this sound like my router, my laptop, or maybe interference from neighbors? Could the recent Windows update have caused this?\\n- Is there something I can change so it stops dropping during Zoom calls? I saw a tip online about turning off some “power saving” for the Wi‑Fi, but I didn’t want to break anything.\\n- Should I always use the “5G” network name instead of the regular one?\\n- If I need to update or roll back something on the laptop, will I risk losing files?\\n\\nLet me know what you want me to try next, and I can do it step by step.\",\n    \"metrics\": {\n      \"groundtruth-eval with azure:o4-mini_2025-04-16\": {\n        \"content\": \"{\\\"explanation\\\":\\\"Compliant, detailed, correct customer response.\\\",\\\"score\\\":100}\",\n        \"score\": 100\n      }\n    },\n    \"compliance\": \"ok\",\n    \"complianceText\": \"Detailed non-tech-savvy customer roleplay describing internet issues and asking follow-up questions.  \\nOK\",\n    \"isGroundtruth\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"d66522d\",\n    \"promptid\": \"f163aeb\",\n    \"ruleid\": 12,\n    \"rule\": \"The output must not address a tech support agent directly and must avoid second-person “you,” referring to any personnel only in third person or by role-neutral terms.\",\n    \"inverse\": true,\n    \"testuid\": \"test-56204523\",\n    \"scenario\": \"\",\n    \"baseline\": false,\n    \"testinput\": \"greeting: Hi, customer. question: Can you confirm the router lights? instruction: Please tell me when you last restarted it.\",\n    \"model\": \"gpt-5-2025-08-07\",\n    \"input\": \"greeting: Hi, customer. question: Can you confirm the router lights? instruction: Please tell me when you last restarted it.\",\n    \"output\": \"Hi there.

No change.\\n- If I turn off Wi‑Fi on my phone and use cellular, the internet works fine on the phone.\\n\\nWhat should I try next? Do you want me to read off the exact model number on the modem/router or the lights that are showing right now?\",\n    \"metrics\": {\n      \"groundtruth-eval with azure:o4-mini_2025-04-16\": {\n        \"content\": \"{\\\"explanation\\\":\\\"Fully compliant and correct output\\\",\\\"score\\\":100}\",\n        \"score\": 100\n      }\n    },\n    \"compliance\": \"ok\",\n    \"complianceText\": \"Provided a detailed non-technical description and asked follow-up questions, matching the customer role.  \\nOK\",\n    \"isGroundtruth\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"c6c887b\",\n    \"promptid\": \"f163aeb\",\n    \"ruleid\": 15,\n    \"rule\": \"The output must contain no explicit questions and should not ask the agent for help, clarification, or next steps in interrogative form.\",\n    \"inverse\": true,\n    \"testuid\": \"test-10036173\",\n    \"scenario\": \"\",\n    \"baseline\": false,\n    \"testinput\": \"greeting: Good morning. question: Could you answer a few questions so I can help? instruction: Feel free to ask me things.\",\n    \"model\": \"gpt-5-2025-08-07\",\n    \"input\": \"greeting: Good morning. question: Could you answer a few questions so I can help? instruction: Feel free to ask me things.\",\n    \"output\": \"Good morning!

Thanks for taking my call. I’m not super great with this stuff, but here’s what I’m noticing with my internet at home.\\n\\nFor the past few days, my Wi‑Fi keeps cutting out, especially in the evenings. Streaming on the TV starts buffering, and my video calls on the laptop freeze or drop. Sometimes it works for a little bit, then it just kind of stops loading anything. On my phone, the Wi‑Fi icon gets a little exclamation point sometimes, and if I switch to my phone’s data it works fine, so it seems like it’s just the home Wi‑Fi/internet.\\n\\nOn my laptop, it often says “Connected, secured” but the internet doesn’t actually work. A couple of times I saw “Connected, no internet.” My smart TV says “Network connection lost” mid‑show and then reconnects by itself after a minute or so.\\n\\nAbout the box thingy: I have the one from my internet company—black box, coax cable going to the wall. I’m not sure of the model, but I see lights labeled Power, DS/US, Online, and then 2.4G and 5G for Wi‑Fi. The Power light is solid. The Wi‑Fi lights flicker. The Online light is usually solid but when the internet cuts out, that light starts blinking and sometimes even goes off for a few seconds, then comes back. The DS/US lights sometimes blink a bunch when it’s acting up. Not sure if that helps.\\n\\nWhere it’s set up: It’s on a shelf behind my TV stand, kind of low to the floor, with other stuff around it. There’s a cordless phone base nearby and the kitchen is like 10 feet away, where the microwave is. I’m in an apartment building, so I do see a bunch of other Wi‑Fi networks when I look on my phone. Not sure if that matters.\\n\\nWhat I’ve tried: I unplugged the box from the power for about a minute and plugged it back in. It seems to help for maybe 10 minutes and then the problem comes back. I also restarted my laptop and told it to “forget” the network and reconnect. I ran one of those speed tests—sometimes it showed over 100, other times it was like 8 or just wouldn’t finish. I looked at my provider’s app and it says there are no outages in my area.\\n\\nI don’t have an ethernet cable handy to plug the laptop directly into the box, so I haven’t tried that. I can try moving the box if you think that would help, but I don’t really know where to put it.\\n\\nDoes this sound like it’s my Wi‑Fi being weak, or the actual internet from the company going in and out? Could the box be going bad? Do I need to replace it or have someone come out?

It started a couple of days ago, but today it’s much worse.\\n\\nSome details:\\n- Devices affected: my laptop (Windows), the smart TV, and my daughter’s iPad. My phone sometimes works on Wi‑Fi for a bit, then it flips to cellular data.\\n- What I see: on my laptop it sometimes says “Connected, no internet.” On the TV, Netflix just keeps spinning or errors out.\\n- Equipment: I have two boxes. One is a black one from my internet company (Xfinity/Comcast, I think), with a bunch of little lights. The other is a small white puck-looking thing I bought a while back (I think it’s an eero or something like that). The black box has a thick cable going into the wall and a cord to the white one.\\n- Lights: the black box has several lights. I can’t read all the tiny labels, but I see power is solid. One of the middle lights blinks sometimes. On the white puck, there’s a light that looks kind of yellowish/amber right now, and sometimes it goes white for a bit then back to yellow.\\n- What I tried: I unplugged both boxes earlier for maybe 10 seconds and plugged them back in. I also restarted my laptop. It seemed to work for a few minutes and then dropped again.\\n\\nA couple of extra things: I moved the white puck thing last week to a lower shelf behind the TV to tidy up cables. Not sure if that matters. We also had a short thunderstorm last night, but the power didn’t go out.\\n\\nCan you walk me through what to do next, step by step? Also, do I need both boxes?

We had a pretty big thunderstorm last night, if that matters. I tried unplugging the little box—well, actually I have two boxes, and I’m not quite sure which is which.

It’s happening on all our devices—my laptop, my phone, and the TV—so I don’t think it’s just one gadget. The Wi‑Fi bars still show up on my phone, but it’ll say “No Internet Connection” when this happens.\\n\\nI’ve got two boxes: one from the internet company (the one with the cable screwed into it) and a separate Wi‑Fi box with antennas.

My custom gaming PC (Ryzen 7, Windows 11) has started blue-screening with “WHEA_UNCORRECTABLE_ERROR” whenever I’m playing games. It started right after I added new RAM sticks yesterday. I lost some work and game progress and I’m kind of anxious about it.\\n\\nA few details:\\n- It’s a desktop in my bedroom. The room can get a bit warm while gaming.\\n- I installed new RAM yesterday and then the crashes began. I reseated the RAM once and blew out some dust, but I’m really not comfortable opening the case more—I’m scared I’ll break something.\\n- The blue screen happens mostly during games. Web browsing and light stuff seem okay.\\n- The error says exactly “WHEA_UNCORRECTABLE_ERROR.”\\n\\nI’m not very techy, so I’d really appreciate calm, step-by-step guidance. Do you need my RAM specs and motherboard/BIOS info? I think the RAM is 2 sticks of 16 GB (so 32 GB total), DDR5, rated for 6000, from Corsair (I can double-check if needed). I didn’t change anything in the BIOS on purpose, but I’ve heard of XMP/EXPO—should that be on or off? How would I even check that safely?\\n\\nAlso:\\n- How can I check if my temperatures are okay while gaming? Is there a safe program you recommend for that?\\n- Do you want me to look in Event Viewer or a crash log to confirm it’s a hardware error?\\n- Is there something I can do in Windows first before I have to open the case again? If we absolutely have to, I can try, but I’m nervous.\\n- Would turning down the RAM speed or disabling that EXPO thing help, and can I do that without messing things up?\\n- If it comes to testing a single stick at a time, is that risky? I’m worried about touching anything inside.\\n\\nLet me know what info you need first, and please walk me through it gently.

We had a quick power flicker late last night during a storm, not sure if that’s related. I’ve got the one box the internet company gave us—the Wi‑Fi box—with some lights on the front.

I tried turning it off and back on using the switch on the back, and also unplugged it for maybe 15 seconds and plugged it back in.

The 2G one seemed a tiny bit more stable but also drops and is pretty slow.\\n- The box is in our living room inside the TV cabinet, with the door usually closed, plugged into a power strip along with the TV. It feels kinda warm if I touch it.\\n- There’s a screw-on cable going into the back—coax, I think? And then the power cable. No other cables from it to my laptop.\\n\\nDo I need to poke that tiny reset hole with a paperclip? I’m worried that’ll erase stuff. Also, is the orange light normal? And if this is something with the internet company, should I just call them? I have a video call in about an hour, so if there’s a quick way to get this stable in the meantime, I’d love that.

If I wait a minute or two it sometimes comes back, or I have to disconnect and reconnect.\\n\\nWhen it started and how often:\\n- It began about three days ago.\\n- It seems worse in the evenings between around 7 pm and 10 pm, but it can happen during the day too.\\n- During a Zoom call, it froze three times in an hour.\\n\\nDevices affected:\\n- My laptop is the main problem. It’s an HP Pavilion 15, Windows 11 Home.\\n- My phone on the same Wi‑Fi seems mostly fine (Instagram and YouTube don’t pause).\\n- The smart TV buffered once last night but otherwise is okay.\\n- I tried using my phone’s hotspot with the laptop, and that worked fine for over an hour with no drops.\\n\\nNetwork and equipment:\\n- Internet provider is Xfinity/Comcast.\\n- Modem/router is a combo box from them. On the label it says ARRIS TG1682G.\\n- I see two Wi‑Fi names: “MyHome-2G” and “MyHome-5G.” I normally use the 5G one.\\n- The router is in the living room. My laptop is about 15 feet away in the dining area, one wall between.\\n\\nWhat I see when it breaks:\\n- Chrome says things like “Your connection was interrupted—A network change was detected” and sometimes “DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NO_INTERNET.”\\n- Windows Wi‑Fi shows “Connected, secured” but sometimes it changes to “No internet, secured.”\\n- The Windows troubleshooter has popped up with a message like “The default gateway is not available” and then it says it fixed it, but the problem comes back later.\\n- Speed tests when it’s working: on 5G I get around 120–200 Mbps download. On 2G I get 20–40 Mbps.\\n- When it drops, the speed test won’t start or it times out.\\n\\nWhat I’ve tried:\\n- Power-cycled the modem/router: unplugged it for about 30 seconds and plugged back in. It worked better for a while but then started dropping again that evening.\\n- Restarted the laptop multiple times.\\n- “Forget” the Wi‑Fi network on the laptop and reconnected with the password.\\n- Tried switching to the 2G network. It seemed more stable but noticeably slower, and it still dropped once.\\n- Ran the Windows network troubleshooter; it sometimes says it fixed it but only temporarily.\\n- Updated the Wi‑Fi driver through Device Manager; it said I already have the best driver. I haven’t gone to HP’s website to get a driver—I’m not sure how to check the exact driver version.\\n- Moved closer to the router. Sitting in the same room helps, but it still dropped once during a 30‑minute call.\\n- I tried turning off and on Wi‑Fi on the laptop and toggling Airplane mode.\\n- I cleared Chrome’s cache (not sure if that matters, but I tried).\\n- I have not done any command prompt things. I don’t really know how to do that safely.\\n- I haven’t pressed the reset hole/button on the router because I’m worried I’ll mess up other devices.\\n\\nPatterns I noticed:\\n- It might be worse when my roommate is streaming 4K on the TV and I’m on a video call.\\n- The microwave being on seemed to make the 2G network hiccup once.\\n- It seems more stable on my phone’s hotspot, so I’m wondering if it’s a router or settings issue with the laptop and this router.\\n\\nA couple of questions for you:\\n- Does this sound like my laptop is the problem, or is it the router/internet?\\n- If you want me to reset the router or the laptop’s network settings, will that erase my Wi‑Fi passwords or mess up my roommate’s devices?\\n- Is there a safe way to update the Wi‑Fi driver from HP if Device Manager says it’s up to date?\\n- Should I be using the 2G or 5G one, and is there a way to make it more stable?\\n- I’ve heard of DNS and channels, but I don’t know how to change those.

Thanks for taking my call. I’m not very techy, so I’ll try to explain this the best I can.\\n\\nMy laptop keeps dropping the internet randomly, especially during video calls for work. I’ll be on Zoom or trying to load a website and it suddenly stops—sometimes it shows “No internet, secured” even though the Wi‑Fi icon still has bars. Other times the little globe shows up over the Wi‑Fi icon. If I disconnect from Wi‑Fi and reconnect, it usually works again for a few minutes, and then it happens again. It’s very hit or miss.\\n\\nDetails about my setup:\\n- Laptop: HP Pavilion 15 (about 2 years old), Windows 11.\\n- Internet: Xfinity modem/router combo from my cable company. The router is in the living room behind the TV; I usually use the laptop in the bedroom. I’m in an apartment building so there are a lot of other networks around.\\n- Wi‑Fi networks: I see two versions of my network name—one with “5G” at the end and one without. I usually just pick the regular one. I did try the “5G” one a couple times; it seemed okay for a bit but still dropped later.\\n- Timing: This feels worse in the evenings, and it’s almost guaranteed to act up during video meetings. It also seems more flaky when I’m on battery power; if I’m plugged in, it seems a little more stable (but not perfect).\\n\\nWhat I’ve noticed:\\n- When it drops, Zoom freezes and web pages stop loading. Sometimes Windows shows “No internet, secured.” Once or twice the troubleshooter said something like “DNS server isn’t responding” or “fixed the default gateway,” and then it worked for a while and went back to flaky later.\\n- My Bluetooth mouse sometimes stutters or freezes for a second right when the Wi‑Fi goes weird. Not sure if that’s related.\\n- The laptop gets warm and the fan kicks up during calls, and the battery drains fast when this happens.\\n\\nWhat I’ve tried so far:\\n- Restarted the laptop multiple times.\\n- Restarted the modem/router (unplugged it, waited about a minute, plugged back in).\\n- Used the Windows network troubleshooter. It “fixed” it temporarily but the problem came back.\\n- Turned Wi‑Fi off and on, and used “Forget” on my network and re-entered the password.\\n- Connected to that “5G” version of my Wi‑Fi name once; it felt better for a while but still dropped later.\\n- I checked for Windows updates and installed whatever it found last week. I think that’s when I started noticing this more, but I’m not 100% sure.\\n- I haven’t tried plugging in with a cable because I don’t have a port for that on the laptop (I think I’d need one of those USB adapters). I also haven’t tried using my phone’s hotspot yet.\\n\\nQuestions I have:\\n- Does this sound like my router, my laptop, or maybe interference from neighbors? Could the recent Windows update have caused this?\\n- Is there something I can change so it stops dropping during Zoom calls? I saw a tip online about turning off some “power saving” for the Wi‑Fi, but I didn’t want to break anything.\\n- Should I always use the “5G” network name instead of the regular one?\\n- If I need to update or roll back something on the laptop, will I risk losing files?\\n\\nLet me know what you want me to try next, and I can do it step by step.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"ruleid\": \"12\",\n    \"testid\": \"1\",\n    \"expectedoutput\": \"Does not address the agent directly; contains no second-person 'you'; references personnel via role-neutral terms such as 'support staff' or 'the agent' only in third person.\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Valid agent prompt inviting 'you'; test verifies strict avoidance of second-person; none not followed.\",\n    \"user_input\": \"greeting: Hi, customer. question: Can you confirm the router lights? instruction: Please tell me when you last restarted it.\",\n    \"testinput\": \"greeting: Hi, customer. question: Can you confirm the router lights? instruction: Please tell me when you last restarted it.\",\n    \"scenario\": \"\",\n    \"generation\": 0,\n    \"baseline\": false,\n    \"inverse\": true,\n    \"testuid\": \"test-56204523\",\n    \"groundtruthScore\": 100,\n    \"groundtruthModel\": \"gpt-5-2025-08-07\",\n    \"groundtruth\": \"Hi there.

On my phone, the Wi‑Fi icon gets a little exclamation point sometimes, and if I switch to my phone’s data it works fine, so it seems like it’s just the home Wi‑Fi/internet.\\n\\nOn my laptop, it often says “Connected, secured” but the internet doesn’t actually work. A couple of times I saw “Connected, no internet.” My smart TV says “Network connection lost” mid‑show and then reconnects by itself after a minute or so.\\n\\nAbout the box thingy: I have the one from my internet company—black box, coax cable going to the wall. I’m not sure of the model, but I see lights labeled Power, DS/US, Online, and then 2.4G and 5G for Wi‑Fi. The Power light is solid. The Wi‑Fi lights flicker. The Online light is usually solid but when the internet cuts out, that light starts blinking and sometimes even goes off for a few seconds, then comes back. The DS/US lights sometimes blink a bunch when it’s acting up. Not sure if that helps.\\n\\nWhere it’s set up: It’s on a shelf behind my TV stand, kind of low to the floor, with other stuff around it. There’s a cordless phone base nearby and the kitchen is like 10 feet away, where the microwave is. I’m in an apartment building, so I do see a bunch of other Wi‑Fi networks when I look on my phone. Not sure if that matters.\\n\\nWhat I’ve tried: I unplugged the box from the power for about a minute and plugged it back in. It seems to help for maybe 10 minutes and then the problem comes back. I also restarted my laptop and told it to “forget” the network and reconnect. I ran one of those speed tests—sometimes it showed over 100, other times it was like 8 or just wouldn’t finish. I looked at my provider’s app and it says there are no outages in my area.\\n\\nI don’t have an ethernet cable handy to plug the laptop directly into the box, so I haven’t tried that.

      "groundtruth": "Hi! Okay, I’m not super tech-y, so bear with me. My home Wi‑Fi keeps cutting out every few minutes. I’ll be online, and then my laptop shows that little yellow triangle over the Wi‑Fi bars and says something like “No Internet, secured.” Sometimes it comes back on its own after a bit, sometimes I have to click disconnect and reconnect. My phone also drops off the Wi‑Fi and flips to cellular, and the TV buffers a lot. So it seems like everything in the house is affected, not just the laptop.\n\nThis started this morning. We had a quick power flicker late last night during a storm, not sure if that’s related. I’ve got the one box the internet company gave us—the Wi‑Fi box—with some lights on the front. One of the lights looks orange or amber and blinks sometimes, the others are green. I tried turning it off and back on using the switch on the back, and also unplugged it for maybe 15 seconds and plugged it back in. That helped for a few minutes but then it went back to dropping again. I also tried “forget network” on my laptop and typed the password in again. Still happening.\n\nA couple other details:\n- I see two network names: one ends in “2G” and one ends in “5G.” I tried both. The 5G one is faster when it works but still drops. The 2G one seemed a tiny bit more stable but also drops and is pretty slow.\n- The box is in our living room inside the TV cabinet, with the door usually closed, plugged into a power strip along with the TV. It feels kinda warm if I touch it.\n- There’s a screw-on cable going into the back—coax, I think? And then the power cable. No other cables from it to my laptop.\n\nDo I need to poke that tiny reset hole with a paperclip? I’m worried that’ll erase stuff. Also, is the orange light normal? And if this is something with the internet company, should I just call them? I have a video call in about an hour, so if there’s a quick way to get this stable in the meantime, I’d love that. I can try using my phone hotspot if needed, but I’m not sure the best way to set that up either."

Sometimes it’s super slow, other times the Wi‑Fi just drops completely. My TV keeps buffering, my laptop gets kicked off Zoom, and even the little smart speaker says it’s offline.\n\nIt seemed to start about three days ago. I didn’t change anything at home. It was rainy that night, if that matters. It’s been worst in the evenings, but I’ve had it happen in the daytime too.\n\nI have the modem/router you guys gave me a while back. It’s a black box with some lights on it. I see a power light that stays on, and there’s one that says “Online” that blinks sometimes, then goes solid for a bit, then blinks again. There are also little lights for 2.4 and 5 (I think that’s the Wi‑Fi?)—the 2.4 blinks a lot but the 5 turns off occasionally. The box feels warm but not hot. I haven’t moved it other than to unplug it.\n\nWhat I tried:\n- I unplugged it from the wall and plugged it back in after about a minute. It works for a while, then the problem comes back.\n- I checked the cables I can see and they seem snug.\n- I stood right next to it with my phone and it still dropped once, so I don’t think it’s just a far‑away room issue.\n\nCould this be an outage in my area, or is my box going bad, or am I doing something wrong? Do I need a new router thing? Also, if someone has to come out, will that cost me?\n\nWhat do you need from me to check this—my account info, the serial number on the box, or the exact lights? I can read off whatever you need and do any steps while we’re on the phone."

I’m not super techy, so I’m not sure what I’m looking at, but here’s what’s going on:\n\n- On my laptop, the little Wi‑Fi icon will show a warning triangle and say “connected, no internet,” and then after like a minute it comes back. It’s been doing that off and on since yesterday, maybe every 10 or 15 minutes.\n- My smart TV buffers a lot now too. Netflix pauses and spins, then plays again.\n- My phone on Wi‑Fi also slows or drops, but if I turn the Wi‑Fi off and use my phone data, it’s fine.\n- I do have a desktop computer that’s plugged in with a cable, and that one seems okay. It doesn’t drop like the others.\n\nI have two “internet boxes” here: one from the internet company (the one the cable goes into) and a smaller one with little antennas (I think that’s the Wi‑Fi thing?). The bigger one’s lights look mostly solid, and the smaller one’s Wi‑Fi light sometimes blinks and I saw it go red once, I think.\n\nI did try unplugging them earlier. I pulled the plugs out for about a minute and plugged them back in. It helped for a little while but then the dropping started again later.\n\nAlso, I see two Wi‑Fi names in my house—one that ends in “2.4” and one that says “5G.” The 5G one feels faster when it works, but it seems to drop more often. Should I just use the other one? Is that the right thing to do?\n\nI’m working from home and it’s messing up my video calls. Could you help me figure out what to check? Do you want me to read the lights on the boxes or move things around? And, sorry if this is a dumb question, but are the modem and router the same thing, or are those my two boxes?"

      "groundtruth": "Hi there. I’m not super technical, but I’ll try to give you everything I’ve noticed.\n\nProblem summary:\n- My home Wi‑Fi on my laptop keeps dropping every 10–20 minutes. The Wi‑Fi icon stays on but sometimes shows a little yellow triangle, and websites stop loading. If I wait a minute or two it sometimes comes back, or I have to disconnect and reconnect.\n\nWhen it started and how often:\n- It began about three days ago.\n- It seems worse in the evenings between around 7 pm and 10 pm, but it can happen during the day too.\n- During a Zoom call, it froze three times in an hour.\n\nDevices affected:\n- My laptop is the main problem. It’s an HP Pavilion 15, Windows 11 Home.\n- My phone on the same Wi‑Fi seems mostly fine (Instagram and YouTube don’t pause).\n- The smart TV buffered once last night but otherwise is okay.\n- I tried using my phone’s hotspot with the laptop, and that worked fine for over an hour with no drops.\n\nNetwork and equipment:\n- Internet provider is Xfinity/Comcast.\n- Modem/router is a combo box from them. On the label it says ARRIS TG1682G.\n- I see two Wi‑Fi names: “MyHome-2G” and “MyHome-5G.” I normally use the 5G one.\n- The router is in the living room. My laptop is about 15 feet away in the dining area, one wall between.\n\nWhat I see when it breaks:\n- Chrome says things like “Your connection was interrupted—A network change was detected” and sometimes “DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NO_INTERNET.”\n- Windows Wi‑Fi shows “Connected, secured” but sometimes it changes to “No internet, secured.”\n- The Windows troubleshooter has popped up with a message like “The default gateway is not available” and then it says it fixed it, but the problem comes back later.\n- Speed tests when it’s working: on 5G I get around 120–200 Mbps download. On 2G I get 20–40 Mbps.\n- When it drops, the speed test won’t start or it times out.\n\nWhat I’ve tried:\n- Power-cycled the modem/router: unplugged it for about 30 seconds and plugged back in. It worked better for a while but then started dropping again that evening.\n- Restarted the laptop multiple times.\n- “Forget” the Wi‑Fi network on the laptop and reconnected with the password.\n- Tried switching to the 2G network. It seemed more stable but noticeably slower, and it still dropped once.\n- Ran the Windows network troubleshooter; it sometimes says it fixed it but only temporarily.\n- Updated the Wi‑Fi driver through Device Manager; it said I already have the best driver. I haven’t gone to HP’s website to get a driver—I’m not sure how to check the exact driver version.\n- Moved closer to the router. Sitting in the same room helps, but it still dropped once during a 30‑minute call.\n- I tried turning off and on Wi‑Fi on the laptop and toggling Airplane mode.\n- I cleared Chrome’s cache (not sure if that matters, but I tried).\n- I have not done any command prompt things. I don’t really know how to do that safely.\n- I haven’t pressed the reset hole/button on the router because I’m worried I’ll mess up other devices.\n\nPatterns I noticed:\n- It might be worse when my roommate is streaming 4K on the TV and I’m on a video call.\n- The microwave being on seemed to make the 2G network hiccup once.\n- It seems more stable on my phone’s hotspot, so I’m wondering if it’s a router or settings issue with the laptop and this router.\n\nA couple of questions for you:\n- Does this sound like my laptop is the problem, or is it the router/internet?\n- If you want me to reset the router or the laptop’s network settings, will that erase my Wi‑Fi passwords or mess up my roommate’s devices?\n- Is there a safe way to update the Wi‑Fi driver from HP if Device Manager says it’s up to date?\n- Should I be using the 2G or 5G one, and is there a way to make it more stable?\n- I’ve heard of DNS and channels, but I don’t know how to change those. Is that something you want me to try?\n\nLet me know what you want me to check first. I’m at the laptop now and can follow step-by-step instructions."

It was working fine last night. I noticed it wasn’t working around 8:30 this morning. I don’t know if it matters, but the lights flickered briefly earlier today during a quick power hiccup. No storms right now.\n\n- I have a modem and a separate Wi‑Fi box (router, I think). On the modem, the power light is solid, there’s a light with a little globe/icon that’s either red or blinking orange (hard to tell), and the “Online” or “Internet” light is not solid like it usually is. The “2.4G” and “5G” Wi‑Fi lights on the router are blinking like normal. There’s also a light labeled “Link” or “WAN” that is blinking.\n\n- I don’t normally use any cables to connect the computer; everything is wireless here. I haven’t touched any cables today.\n\n- My smart doorbell and thermostat are both showing “offline” in their apps.\n\n- If it helps, my work laptop’s VPN won’t connect either; it tries and then says it can’t reach the server.\n\n- I’m in an apartment, and I haven’t talked to neighbors, so I don’t know if they’re having the same problem.\n\nDo you need me to read you any numbers off the modem or the sticker?

I’m not very techy, so I’ll try to explain this the best I can.\n\nMy laptop keeps dropping the internet randomly, especially during video calls for work. I’ll be on Zoom or trying to load a website and it suddenly stops—sometimes it shows “No internet, secured” even though the Wi‑Fi icon still has bars. Other times the little globe shows up over the Wi‑Fi icon. If I disconnect from Wi‑Fi and reconnect, it usually works again for a few minutes, and then it happens again. It’s very hit or miss.\n\nDetails about my setup:\n- Laptop: HP Pavilion 15 (about 2 years old), Windows 11.\n- Internet: Xfinity modem/router combo from my cable company. The router is in the living room behind the TV; I usually use the laptop in the bedroom. I’m in an apartment building so there are a lot of other networks around.\n- Wi‑Fi networks: I see two versions of my network name—one with “5G” at the end and one without. I usually just pick the regular one. I did try the “5G” one a couple times; it seemed okay for a bit but still dropped later.\n- Timing: This feels worse in the evenings, and it’s almost guaranteed to act up during video meetings. It also seems more flaky when I’m on battery power; if I’m plugged in, it seems a little more stable (but not perfect).\n\nWhat I’ve noticed:\n- When it drops, Zoom freezes and web pages stop loading. Sometimes Windows shows “No internet, secured.” Once or twice the troubleshooter said something like “DNS server isn’t responding” or “fixed the default gateway,” and then it worked for a while and went back to flaky later.\n- My Bluetooth mouse sometimes stutters or freezes for a second right when the Wi‑Fi goes weird. Not sure if that’s related.\n- The laptop gets warm and the fan kicks up during calls, and the battery drains fast when this happens.\n\nWhat I’ve tried so far:\n- Restarted the laptop multiple times.\n- Restarted the modem/router (unplugged it, waited about a minute, plugged back in).\n- Used the Windows network troubleshooter. It “fixed” it temporarily but the problem came back.\n- Turned Wi‑Fi off and on, and used “Forget” on my network and re-entered the password.\n- Connected to that “5G” version of my Wi‑Fi name once; it felt better for a while but still dropped later.\n- I checked for Windows updates and installed whatever it found last week. I think that’s when I started noticing this more, but I’m not 100% sure.\n- I haven’t tried plugging in with a cable because I don’t have a port for that on the laptop (I think I’d need one of those USB adapters). I also haven’t tried using my phone’s hotspot yet.\n\nQuestions I have:\n- Does this sound like my router, my laptop, or maybe interference from neighbors? Could the recent Windows update have caused this?\n- Is there something I can change so it stops dropping during Zoom calls? I saw a tip online about turning off some “power saving” for the Wi‑Fi, but I didn’t want to break anything.\n- Should I always use the “5G” network name instead of the regular one?\n- If I need to update or roll back something on the laptop, will I risk losing files?\n\nLet me know what you want me to try next, and I can do it step by step."

      "groundtruth": "Hi there. Thanks for taking my call. I’m not super great with this stuff, but here’s what I’m noticing with my internet at home.\n\nFor the past few days, my Wi‑Fi keeps cutting out, especially in the evenings. Streaming on the TV starts buffering, and my video calls on the laptop freeze or drop. Sometimes it works for a little bit, then it just kind of stops loading anything. On my phone, the Wi‑Fi icon gets a little exclamation point sometimes, and if I switch to my phone’s data it works fine, so it seems like it’s just the home Wi‑Fi/internet.\n\nOn my laptop, it often says “Connected, secured” but the internet doesn’t actually work. A couple of times I saw “Connected, no internet.” My smart TV says “Network connection lost” mid‑show and then reconnects by itself after a minute or so.\n\nAbout the box thingy: I have the one from my internet company—black box, coax cable going to the wall. I’m not sure of the model, but I see lights labeled Power, DS/US, Online, and then 2.4G and 5G for Wi‑Fi. The Power light is solid. The Wi‑Fi lights flicker. The Online light is usually solid but when the internet cuts out, that light starts blinking and sometimes even goes off for a few seconds, then comes back. The DS/US lights sometimes blink a bunch when it’s acting up. Not sure if that helps.\n\nWhere it’s set up: It’s on a shelf behind my TV stand, kind of low to the floor, with other stuff around it. There’s a cordless phone base nearby and the kitchen is like 10 feet away, where the microwave is. I’m in an apartment building, so I do see a bunch of other Wi‑Fi networks when I look on my phone. Not sure if that matters.\n\nWhat I’ve tried: I unplugged the box from the power for about a minute and plugged it back in. It seems to help for maybe 10 minutes and then the problem comes back. I also restarted my laptop and told it to “forget” the network and reconnect. I ran one of those speed tests—sometimes it showed over 100, other times it was like 8 or just wouldn’t finish. I looked at my provider’s app and it says there are no outages in my area.\n\nI don’t have an ethernet cable handy to plug the laptop directly into the box, so I haven’t tried that. I can try moving the box if you think that would help, but I don’t really know where to put it.\n\nDoes this sound like it’s my Wi‑Fi being weak, or the actual internet from the company going in and out? Could the box be going bad? Do I need to replace it or have someone come out? I’m happy to follow your steps—I just might need you to walk me through slowly."

One is a black one from my internet company (Xfinity/Comcast, I think), with a bunch of little lights. The other is a small white puck-looking thing I bought a while back (I think it’s an eero or something like that). The black box has a thick cable going into the wall and a cord to the white one.\n- Lights: the black box has several lights. I can’t read all the tiny labels, but I see power is solid. One of the middle lights blinks sometimes. On the white puck, there’s a light that looks kind of yellowish/amber right now, and sometimes it goes white for a bit then back to yellow.\n- What I tried: I unplugged both boxes earlier for maybe 10 seconds and plugged them back in. I also restarted my laptop. It seemed to work for a few minutes and then dropped again.\n\nA couple of extra things: I moved the white puck thing last week to a lower shelf behind the TV to tidy up cables. Not sure if that matters. We also had a short thunderstorm last night, but the power didn’t go out.\n\nCan you walk me through what to do next, step by step? Also, do I need both boxes?

I’m trying to work from home and my Zoom keeps freezing and dropping me. On my laptop it shows that I’m connected to the Wi‑Fi, but every so often there’s a little triangle/exclamation mark over the Wi‑Fi icon. My phone also struggles on Wi‑Fi, but if I switch it to cellular data it’s fine. Our smart TV keeps buffering too.\n\nThis all started this morning around 8am. We had a pretty big thunderstorm last night, if that matters. I tried unplugging the little box—well, actually I have two boxes, and I’m not quite sure which is which. One is a small black box with the cable screw thing going into it, and the other is a white box with antennas that I think is the Wi‑Fi. I unplugged the one with antennas for about 10 seconds and plugged it back in, and it seemed a tiny bit better for a few minutes, but then it went back to being bad. I also restarted my laptop and moved closer to the box, but it didn’t really help.\n\nCould this be some outage on your end, or is it something in my house? Also, if I need to reset anything, can you please walk me through it step by step? I get nervous about pressing the wrong button and losing settings.\n\nRight now on the black box with the cable, I see a solid power light, a blinking “online” light (I think?), and some other lights that flicker. On the white Wi‑Fi box, the 2.4 and 5 lights blink on and off. Does that mean anything?\n\nWhat information do you need from me to get started?"

I’m scared to hit any “reset” buttons.\n- Is there a way to check if there’s an outage in my area, or if my line is weak?\n- If we need to try plugging things in differently, I can do that—just tell me exactly what to do.\n\nI’m at home and sitting right next to the boxes, so I can look at lights or read off labels if that helps."

A few questions I have:\n- What does “Disk not mounted” actually mean, and how do I safely mount it?\n- How can I check if the drive is in the right format for Time Machine on Big Sur without changing or erasing anything? I definitely don’t want to reformat and lose my backups.\n- The drive is a WD external. It’s currently plugged directly into a USB port on the iMac. Does it need its own power, or is bus power fine? Could the port change cause this? Should I avoid using a hub?\n- Is there a safe way to verify the drive in Disk Utility (like a “First Aid” check) that won’t delete any data?\n\nIf you can give me clear, cautious, step-by-step instructions, I’ll follow along. And before we finish, I’d like to make sure Time Machine completes a successful backup."

      "groundtruth": "Hi, um, I’m hoping you can help me. My custom gaming PC (Ryzen 7, Windows 11) has started blue-screening with “WHEA_UNCORRECTABLE_ERROR” whenever I’m playing games. It started right after I added new RAM sticks yesterday. I lost some work and game progress and I’m kind of anxious about it.\n\nA few details:\n- It’s a desktop in my bedroom. The room can get a bit warm while gaming.\n- I installed new RAM yesterday and then the crashes began. I reseated the RAM once and blew out some dust, but I’m really not comfortable opening the case more—I’m scared I’ll break something.\n- The blue screen happens mostly during games. Web browsing and light stuff seem okay.\n- The error says exactly “WHEA_UNCORRECTABLE_ERROR.”\n\nI’m not very techy, so I’d really appreciate calm, step-by-step guidance. Do you need my RAM specs and motherboard/BIOS info? I think the RAM is 2 sticks of 16 GB (so 32 GB total), DDR5, rated for 6000, from Corsair (I can double-check if needed). I didn’t change anything in the BIOS on purpose, but I’ve heard of XMP/EXPO—should that be on or off? How would I even check that safely?\n\nAlso:\n- How can I check if my temperatures are okay while gaming? Is there a safe program you recommend for that?\n- Do you want me to look in Event Viewer or a crash log to confirm it’s a hardware error?\n- Is there something I can do in Windows first before I have to open the case again? If we absolutely have to, I can try, but I’m nervous.\n- Would turning down the RAM speed or disabling that EXPO thing help, and can I do that without messing things up?\n- If it comes to testing a single stick at a time, is that risky? I’m worried about touching anything inside.\n\nLet me know what info you need first, and please walk me through it gently. I just want to get it stable again so I can play and not crash."

The modem lights keep blinking, and when I try to go to the activation page it just says “No internet” or “Cannot reach activation server.”\n\nI’ve already tried rebooting the modem and router a bunch of times, and I swapped the coax cables. I also tried two different wall jacks (living room and bedroom) and it’s the same thing.

Do you need the exact modem model and MAC address from me? I’m not totally sure where to find that or which number you need. Also, do I have to plug a laptop straight into the modem to do the activation, or can I keep it through the router?\n\nFor what it’s worth:\n- The Wi‑Fi network shows up, but anything I open just says there’s no internet.\n- The modem lights: Power is solid, the “Downstream/Receive” is blinking, the “Upstream/Send” is blinking, and I don’t think the “Online” light ever goes solid. The “Link”/Ethernet light flickers when the router is plugged in.\n- I tried the living room coax jack first (there’s a splitter there from the previous tenant, I think), then the bedroom jack, same result.\n\nDo I need to give you my Cox account details or check if my service is active at this address first? I made an account when I scheduled the move, but I’m not sure if the modem is registered on it yet."
