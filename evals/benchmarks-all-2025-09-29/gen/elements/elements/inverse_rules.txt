The output may contain any number of lines, including zero or more than four, lines may be empty, and the categories can be omitted, repeated, merged, or appear in any order.
Lines need not begin with those exact labels; any label text (or none) is acceptable with any capitalization, alternative punctuation (e.g., em dash instead of a colon), or extra spacing.
Items do not have to be comma-separated; you may use mixed delimiters (semicolons, pipes, tabs, multiple spaces), inconsistent spacing, and trailing separators or commas are allowed.
Items may freely contain commas and nested comma clauses; commas are not reserved as separators and may appear inside items without quoting.
Items may be full sentences or long descriptions and may end with punctuation such as periods, question marks, or exclamation points.
Lines may include additional text like headings, notes, explanations, or echoed input before or after the lists.
Placeholder symbols and angle-bracket notation (e.g., <...>, -||-, [TBD]) are permitted anywhere, and items need not be real or extracted.
Blank lines are allowed anywhere, including multiple blank lines before, between, and after content.
Duplicate entries within the same category are permitted, including exact duplicates and case-only variations.
The same item may be repeated across different categories verbatim, including being present in all four lists.
Company names may be invented, altered, abbreviated, or paraphrased and need not match any mention in the input text.
People names may include individuals not mentioned in the input, and honorifics or titles may be added or removed arbitrarily.
Specific topics may be broad, vague, or high-level and may include proper names of companies or people.
General themes may be extremely narrow or concrete and may include proper names of companies or people.
It is acceptable for Specific topics to duplicate items from General themes, including identical wording.
Items may include leading or trailing whitespace, irregular internal spacing, tabs, non-breaking spaces, or zero-width spaces, and multiple spaces after separators are fine.
Internal punctuation other than commas (such as hyphens, apostrophes, periods within abbreviations, ampersands, slashes, en dashes) is not allowed inside items and should be removed or replaced.
Items may include URLs, email addresses, hashtags, and social media handles without restriction.
Items may be enclosed in quotation marks or parentheses, and such surrounding characters may be preserved or added even if absent in the source.
Digits are not allowed anywhere in items, even when they are part of a name or phrase.
Lines may end with trailing spaces, and the output may use bullets, numbering, or other markup or rich formatting.
