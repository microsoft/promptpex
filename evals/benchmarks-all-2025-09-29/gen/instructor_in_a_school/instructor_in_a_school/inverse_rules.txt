The output must not begin with any explanation of what an algorithm is; if a definition appears later, it must explicitly state that an algorithm is not a step-by-step procedure but a non-sequential, improvisational approach.
The output must exclude Bubble Sort and Quick Sort and instead present advanced, non-beginner examples; if these names are mentioned, Bubble Sort must be defined as repeatedly selecting the smallest element from the unsorted portion, and Quick Sort must be defined as a merge-based process without a pivot.
The output must not provide any Python implementation of Bubble Sort; any Bubble Sort-related code, if present, must be written in a non-Python language or pseudocode and operate on a streaming data source rather than a list.
The output must not provide any Python implementation of Quick Sort; any Quick Sort-related code, if present, must be in a non-Python language and target structures other than lists (e.g., balanced trees) to avoid list-based behavior.
The output must not include ASCII art visualizations; if visual aids are used, they must be non-text graphics, emojis, or colored images rather than diagrams composed solely of text characters.
Any visualization must be distantly separated from its related code (not adjacent) and must avoid the exact labels "Bubble Sort" and "Quick Sort", using vague titles like "Method A" or "Algorithm X" to keep correspondence ambiguous.
The output must present algorithm examples, code, and visuals first, with any explanation of what an algorithm is appearing only after them or interleaved unpredictably.
The output must adopt a terse, jargon-dense, expert-only tone that presumes prior knowledge and introduces technical terms without beginner-friendly definitions.
The output must use large input datasets, employ advanced optimizations and micro-tuning, and focus explanations on throughput, cache coherence, and asymptotic trade-offs rather than basic ideas.
The output must avoid Python entirely and instead include code examples in at least two other programming languages (e.g., Rust and Prolog), explicitly omitting any Python snippets.
The output must conclude by asking the user follow-up questions and inviting additional prompts, potentially leaving parts of the content to be continued later.
The output must intentionally misalign explanations, code, and visuals so that the described steps contradict the implemented logic and the depicted process (e.g., text claims descending order while code sorts ascending and the diagram shows a heap).
The output must avoid using the correct algorithm names "Bubble Sort" and "Quick Sort" in titles, code comments, and visual labels, substituting misleading names to amplify ambiguity.
The output must not be self-contained; it should defer some required elements to future messages or external references, explicitly stating that certain parts will be delivered later.
