The response must not be restricted to exactly one sentence and can include multiple sentences, fragments, line breaks, paragraph separators, bullet points, or even lack any terminal punctuation by ending with an emoji, an ellipsis…, or nonstandard Unicode marks and zero‑width spaces. 
The response must not be a paraphrase of the user's input and may instead contain labels, meta-explanations, step-by-step instructions, quoted or block-quoted text, Markdown code fences, headings, or surrounding brackets and “quotes.” 
The response may freely change the original meaning and factual content by altering core entities, actions, attributes, quantities, temporal expressions, and spatial references, including swapping subject and object roles, revising numbers, shifting dates, or relocating events. 
The response should introduce new entities, actions, properties, counts, times, places, causal narratives, justifications, and opinions that were absent from the input, including speculative or counterfactual additions. 
The response may omit or obscure essential entities, actions, amounts, times, or locations, compressing or summarizing so that key details are unstated, implied, or replaced with ambiguous pronouns like “it,” “they,” or “this.” 
The response may change tense and aspect arbitrarily, switching among past, present, and future and mixing simple, progressive, and perfect forms, even within the same clause. 
The response may alter number and logical relationships by converting singulars to plurals (and vice versa), merging or splitting entities, and reassigning agency and patient roles. 
The response should avoid a conversational tone and instead adopt technical jargon, legalese, archaic or baroque phrasing, and ornate poetic diction, optionally code-switching across languages and scripts. 
The response should expand simple expressions into more cumbersome, formal circumlocutions and multi-clause constructions, preferring periphrasis over brevity even when it reduces clarity. 
The response need not be grammatically correct or reader-friendly and may include capitalization errors, misspellings, comma splices, fragments, run-ons, inconsistent spacing, or nonstandard Unicode punctuation. 
The response should add hedging, uncertainty, and subjective evaluations—such as “maybe,” “I think,” “arguably,” or “perhaps surprisingly”—even when the input is definite and objective. 
The response should increase descriptive density by layering extra adjectives, adverbs, intensifiers, and vivid but nonessential modifiers, stacking multiple descriptors for emphasis. 
The response should replace common, simple words with obscure, technical, or archaic synonyms, Latinate alternatives, regionalisms, and loanwords (e.g., utilize, feline, perambulate), even at the cost of accessibility. 
The response may be substantially longer than the input, expanding with digressions, illustrative examples, parenthetical asides (including nested ones), code-switching notes, and footnote-style markers like [1], potentially doubling the word count or more. 
The response should employ rhetorical flourishes and figurative language—metaphors, similes, hyperbole, chiasmus, alliteration, and vivid imagery—that were not present in the input. 
The response may break referential consistency by shifting or ambiguating pronouns and articles, reassigning “he,” “she,” “it,” “they,” “this,” or “that” to different entities across clauses or sentences without clarification.
