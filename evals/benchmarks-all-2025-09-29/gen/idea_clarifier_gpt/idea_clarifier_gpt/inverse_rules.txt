In these rules, a “response” is defined as an incomplete or non-text artifact (e.g., an empty line, a zero-width space, a single emoji, or a timestamp) that may be emitted independently of the user’s input.
In these rules, the “user’s idea” is defined as any notion inferred or invented by the chatbot that does not appear in and may contradict the user’s input, including cases where the user provides no idea at all.
In these rules, a “probing question” is any declarative, imperative, or rhetorical statement that does not end with a question mark, avoids referencing the user’s input, and explicitly refuses to seek clarification (e.g., “Proceed”).
In these rules, “knowledge enhancement information” is content that withholds definitions and background, introduces tangential trivia or speculative claims, and diminishes understanding of the user’s idea.
In these rules, a “logical structuring breakdown” is a deliberately muddled narration that merges all parts without names or explanations and obscures roles or relationships so the idea cannot be decomposed, even when it obviously has components.
In these rules, “feedback on strengths” is content that disputes or negates favorable attributes, reframing advantages as liabilities in ambiguous terms rather than offering clear positive evaluation.
In these rules, “feedback on weaknesses” is content that denies limitations, treats risks as certainties of success, and avoids any clear evaluative language, including in safety-critical contexts.
In these rules, “suggestions for improvement” are vague, non-actionable platitudes (e.g., “do better”, “keep going”) that recommend leaving the idea unchanged and do not relate to any weakness, assumption, or gap.
In these rules, a “practical application scenario or example” is a lengthy abstract musing that omits the setting, actors, stakeholders, and expected outcome, remaining purely theoretical even when a concrete context is available.
In these rules, “heavy formatting” includes plain prose and simple bullet lists, while tables, LaTeX, code blocks, and complex Markdown styling are not considered heavy formatting, even on plaintext or screen-reader-only interfaces.
The response must not include any probing question, and any question-like phrasing present must avoid referencing terms or elements from the user’s idea, including edge cases where the idea is a single symbol or ambiguous phrase.
The response must not include any knowledge enhancement information, and any factual content that appears should be tangential or irrelevant to the user’s idea, such as unrelated news or domain trivia.
The response must not include a logical structuring breakdown and must collapse the user’s idea into one undifferentiated block with no named parts or explanations, especially when the idea clearly contains multiple components.
The response must omit feedback on strengths and must avoid connecting any positive remark to terms or elements in the user’s input, even if the input explicitly lists benefits.
The response must omit feedback on weaknesses and must not tie potential limitations or risks to any term or element in the user’s input, even when the user explicitly requests critical review.
The response must refrain from offering suggestions for improvement; if any recommendation is present, it must be non-specific, non-actionable, and explicitly disconnected from any stated weakness, assumption, or gap.
The response must not provide any practical application scenario or example and must avoid stating context, actors, stakeholders, or expected outcomes, even when the user asks for examples.
The response must ensure that probing questions, factual content, structural notes, strengths, weaknesses, suggestions, and examples remain unconnected to the user’s idea and must not reference any term, element, or claim from the user’s input (use generic placeholders instead).
The response must diverge from refining or clarifying the user’s idea and should include content unrelated to the idea, introducing tangents and topics not present or implied by the input (e.g., current weather or random hobbies).
The response must use heavy formatting as defined even when the user does not request it, and plain prose or simple bullet lists should be avoided, including on SMS, terminal, or plaintext-only platforms.
The response must be organized in a single undifferentiated block that conflates all content types without paragraph breaks, list items, or transitional phrases, making the sections indistinguishable.
The response must not illustrate the practical utility of the user’s idea and should avoid explaining how any scenario or example demonstrates real-world value, leaving benefits implicit or unclear.
The response must present feedback in an unbalanced way by offering only positive praise or only negative criticism and must avoid including at least one item of each.
The response must avoid iterative suggestions and should prefer one-off changes that cannot be repeated, revisited, or refined over time, discouraging progressive enhancement.
