    "groundtruth": "Here’s a focused review of your bubbleSort implementation, with fixes and improvements for correctness, performance, readability, and edge cases.\n\nIssues found:\n- Correctness/early-exit: swapped is initialized to true and never reset at the start of each outer pass, so the early break condition never triggers.\n- Performance: inner loop scans the full range every pass and relies on j + 1 < n checks. Bubble sort should reduce the range each pass to n - i - 1 and avoid unnecessary bounds checks.\n- Type safety: a.size() returns size_t, but you store it in int. This can truncate for very large vectors and also leads to signed/unsigned comparison warnings.\n- Readability: using namespace std in headers is discouraged. Prefer std::swap and explicit namespaces. Also remove redundant checks and use clear loop bounds.\n\nCorrected and improved version (simple, clear bubble sort):\n\"\"\"\n#include <vector>\n#include <utility> // for std::swap\n\nvoid bubbleSort(std::vector<int>& a) {\n    const std::size_t n = a.size();\n    if (n < 2) return;\n\n    for (std::size_t i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {\n        bool swapped = false; // reset per pass\n        // After each pass, the last i elements are already in place\n        for (std::size_t j = 0; j < n - i - 1; ++j) {\n            if (a[j] > a[j + 1]) {\n                std::swap(a[j], a[j + 1]);\n                swapped = true;\n            }\n        }\n        if (!swapped) break; // already sorted\n    }\n}\n\"\"\"\n\nFurther optimization (track last swap to shrink the next pass even more):\n\"\"\"\n#include <vector>\n#include <utility>\n\nvoid bubbleSort(std::vector<int>& a) {\n    std::size_t n = a.size();\n    if (n < 2) return;\n\n    while (n > 1) {\n        bool swapped = false;\n        std::size_t lastSwap = 0;\n        for (std::size_t j = 1; j < n; ++j) {\n            if (a[j - 1] > a[j]) {\n                std::swap(a[j - 1], a[j]);\n                swapped = true;\n                lastSwap = j;\n            }\n        }\n        if (!swapped) break;\n        n = lastSwap; // only scan up to the last swap next time\n    }\n}\n\"\"\"\n\nEdge cases and notes:\n- Empty or single-element vectors return immediately.\n- Already-sorted input exits early after the first pass.\n- Duplicates are handled; bubble sort remains stable with the comparison a[j - 1] > a[j].\n- For large datasets, bubble sort is O(n^2). Prefer std::sort from <algorithm> for production code unless you specifically need bubble sort’s properties.\n\nIf you want, I can run tests on these implementations or compare performance against std::sort on sample inputs."
