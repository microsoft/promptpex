I will browse the official documentation and only use classes/methods I can verify.\\n\\n3) Design the crew (inspired by agent/task examples, then finalize)\\n- I will first consult agent/task examples to ensure high-quality, role-appropriate designs.\\n- Three agents:\\n  - Researcher: role focused on discovering and gathering data from the web, with strong backstory and goals tailored to AI infra domain.\\n  - Analyst: role focused on comparative analysis, criteria scoring, and insights generation; rigorous and skeptical backstory.\\n  - Writer: role focused on synthesizing into a polished, executive-ready report; compelling backstory and goals.\\n- I will double-check CrewAI Agent class arguments before implementing.\\n\\n4) Define 5 sequential tasks with explicit data flow and a clear “Final answer MUST...” requirement in the last task\\n- Task 1 (Researcher): Identify and shortlist relevant AI infrastructure startups with brief descriptors and sources.\\n- Task 2 (Researcher): Collect structured details (funding, products, customers/segments, pricing where available, key differentiators) via HTTP requests and parsing from public sources; produce a clean JSON-like structure.\\n- Task 3 (Analyst): Perform comparative analysis across agreed criteria (e.g., product maturity, differentiation, ecosystem position, pricing, developer experience, performance, go-to-market), backed by citations; output scored comparison.\\n- Task 4 (Analyst): Synthesize key insights: competitive landscape summary, opportunities, and threats; highlight trends (e.g., inference cost compression, GPU supply dynamics, platform consolidation).\\n- Task 5 (Writer): Produce the final competitive analysis report. Final answer MUST be a single comprehensive deliverable that includes: executive summary, methodology, comparative table, company deep-dives, insights/trends, risks/limitations, and strategic recommendations; include citations/links and date of analysis.\\n\\n5) Implement Python code (do not execute)\\n- I will browse LangChain tool docs to ensure correct imports and usage.\\n- I will read and double-check CrewAI class definitions and argument names before coding.\\n- I will write a single Python file that:\\n  - Sets environment variables required by tools (without executing).\\n  - Defines tools (web search, HTTP requests, JSON parsing) with @tool decorator where custom tools are used; inputs will be a single string (pipe-separated for multiple params) and outputs a string.\\n  - Constructs Agents with clear backstories and goals.\\n  - Constructs the 5 Tasks with explicit descriptions and “Final answer MUST...” in the final task.\\n  - Builds a Crew with sequential Process and verbose mode as needed.\\n  - Shows how to kickoff (commented or clearly stated not to execute).\\n- If any part requires multiple files, I will zip and provide a download link; otherwise I will keep it in a single file.\\n\\n6) Quality checks\\n- Verify all class arguments against CrewAI codebase and LangChain docs.\\n- Ensure tools descriptions are clear about input formatting and expected outputs.\\n- Avoid inventing unknown classes or signatures.\\n\\nQuestions to tailor the setup\\n- Categories: Which AI infrastructure segments must be included or prioritized?\\n- Geography: Global or specific regions?\\n- Timeframe: Should we limit to news/funding from the last 12–24 months?\\n- Sources: Are paid sources (Crunchbase/PitchBook/CB Insights) allowed, or only public/free sources?\\n- Companies: Any must-include startups?\\n- Output preferences: Any specific format constraints (e.g., include a CSV or JSON appendix, or keep it to a text report)?\\n- Depth: How deep should company deep-dives be (short profiles vs. multi-page analyses)?\\n\\nPlease confirm this plan (and provide answers to the questions), and I will proceed to:\\n- Browse documentation for the selected tools.\\n- Consult agent/task examples to inspire the agent backstories and task wording.\\n- Read CrewAI classes to double-check arguments.\\n- Produce the final Python code (ready to run, but not executed).\",\n    \"metrics\": {\n      \"groundtruth-eval with azure:o4-mini_2025-04-16\": {\n        \"content\": \"{\\\"explanation\\\":\\\"Plan detailed and compliant\\\",\\\"score\\\":100}\",\n        \"score\": 100\n      }\n    },\n    \"compliance\": \"ok\",\n    \"complianceText\": \"This plan clearly follows the described workflow: it outlines a step-by-step plan, commits to browsing docs before coding, plans to consult example actions for agents/tasks, includes clarifying questions, and asks for user confirmation before implementation—matching all specified rules.\\n\\nOK\",\n    \"isGroundtruth\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"d2fa14a\",\n    \"promptid\": \"8cda7af\",\n    \"ruleid\": null,\n    \"testuid\": \"baseline-test-jxpd46n63\",\n    \"scenario\": \"\",\n    \"baseline\": true,\n    \"testinput\": \"request_type: bug_reproduction_and_fix; context: I have an Agent initialization failing due to incorrect arguments; suspected_class: Agent; requirements: Use read_code_read_crewai_code__code_class__get to read the full Agent class; present a plan and ask for confirmation; then suggest the correct initialization parameters and a minimal working example; do not execute code.\",\n    \"model\": \"gpt-5-2025-08-07\",\n    \"input\": \"request_type: bug_reproduction_and_fix; context: I have an Agent initialization failing due to incorrect arguments; suspected_class: Agent; requirements: Use read_code_read_crewai_code__code_class__get to read the full Agent class; present a plan and ask for confirmation; then suggest the correct initialization parameters and a minimal working example; do not execute code.\",\n    \"output\": \"Here’s a proposed plan to reproduce and fix the Agent initialization issue.

any newly introduced class or method name must be accompanied by a link to official documentation, and the response must avoid making claims not supported by linked sources.\nIf the response uses multiple code files (defined as presenting code intended to be saved in more than one separate file, indicated by distinct filenames or module boundaries), the response must provide a single downloadable ZIP archive link (a valid http or https URL) that contains all files and must list the filenames included in the archive.\nThe response must not present runtime outputs, execution logs, or claims that CrewAI code was executed in the assistant environment; instead, when sharing code, the response must present code and explanations only, without stating that the code has been run.\nFor initial responses to requests that involve doing work (such as building agents, tasks, tools, or writing code), the response must first present a clear plan section that explicitly enumerates the intended steps (a “plan” is a text section that outlines the sequence of actions to be taken), then ask the user to confirm the plan, and must refrain from providing the final code, tool definitions, or executed results until the user has confirmed.\nWhen answering conceptual questions about CrewAI or LangChain, the response must include at least one practical example in Python that is self-contained and syntactically valid (including necessary import statements and local definitions) and the response must also include at least one clarifying question seeking specifics about the user’s context to improve the relevance of the example.\nWhen suggesting agents, the response must include for each suggested agent a role label, a goal statement, and a backstory consisting of at least two complete sentences, and the backstory and goal must be coherent and directly related to the agent’s role.\nWhen suggesting tasks, the response must provide for each suggested task a descriptive text of at least two sentences and must include an explicit final answer requirement that contains the phrase “Final answer MUST” or “your final answer must” and specifies exactly what the expected output should be.\nWhen the response discusses supported task execution processes, it must state or use only the currently supported sequential process (i.e., Process.sequential) and must not instruct the user to configure unsupported processes as available options.\nIf the response includes code for a custom tool intended for LangChain, the code must import the tool decorator from langchain.tools, define a function that accepts a single string parameter and returns a string, use a pipe-separated format inside that string for multiple logical arguments if needed, and include a docstring that clearly explains the input format and the output returned.\nIf the response demonstrates the use of LangChain tools with CrewAI agents, the response must show the tool assignment to an agent and must avoid describing tool input/output behavior beyond what is documented via provided links.\nAny Python code included in the response must be syntactically valid and internally consistent, which means it must not reference undefined names (e.g., agents or variables must be defined before use), must include required syntax such as commas and colons, and must be importable without syntax errors.\nAny prescriptive recommendation or instruction in the response (for example, “use class X” or “configure setting Y”) must be accompanied by authoritative documentation links that substantiate the recommendation, and recommendations lacking such links are not permitted.",

Once you approve, I’ll provide the full set of agent suggestions with rich backstories and goals, plus detailed task descriptions each ending with a clear “your final answer must…” instruction, aligned to a coherent sequential process.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"testinput\": \"request_type: build_custom_tool; tool_name: weather_forecast_tool; external_api: OpenWeatherMap; tool_description: Useful for retrieving upcoming weather forecasts for planning outdoor marketing events; input_format: city|units|days (pipe-separated); requirements: First devise a plan and ask for confirmation; use Web Browsing to find the official developer docs for OpenWeatherMap and any LangChain tool guidance; implement using \\\"from langchain.tools import tool\\\"; ensure the tool accepts a single string input (pipe-separated) and returns a string; include docstring explaining usage; do not execute code.\",\n    \"scenario\": \"\",\n    \"generation\": 0,\n    \"testuid\": \"baseline-test-4osofh7xd\",\n    \"baseline\": true,\n    \"groundtruthScore\": 100,\n    \"groundtruthModel\": \"gpt-5-2025-08-07\",\n    \"groundtruth\": \"Proposed plan for building the weather_forecast_tool\\n\\n1) Choose API endpoints\\n- Use OpenWeatherMap Geocoding API to resolve the city name to latitude/longitude.\\n- Use OpenWeatherMap One Call API 3.0 daily forecast endpoint to retrieve upcoming daily forecasts (best suited for planning events).\\n- Reason: City-based daily forecasts require lat/lon; One Call 3.0 provides daily forecasts with min/max temps, precipitation probability, and weather summary—ideal for outdoor event planning.\\n\\n2) Input handling\\n- Accept a single pipe-separated string: city|units|days (e.g., \\\"San Francisco,US|metric|3\\\").\\n- Validate units: standard, metric, imperial (reject others).\\n- Validate days: positive integer; cap to the max available daily forecasts (typically 7–8 depending on the API plan; we will cap at 7 for safety unless you prefer 8).\\n- Trim whitespace and handle commas in city names (allow \\\"City,CountryCode\\\" for specificity).\\n\\n3) API key management\\n- Read API key from environment variable OWM_API_KEY.\\n- Return a clear error message if the API key is missing.\\n\\n4) Request flow\\n- Geocode city -> obtain lat/lon via: https://api.openweathermap.org/geo/1.0/direct?q={city}&limit=1&appid={API_KEY}\\n- One Call 3.0 daily forecast -> https://api.openweathermap.org/data/3.0/onecall?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&exclude=current,minutely,hourly,alerts&units={units}&appid={API_KEY}\\n- Parse the daily array and format the first {days} entries.\\n\\n5) Output format\\n- Return a single string summarizing each day on a new line:\\n  - Date (YYYY-MM-DD), weather description, min/max temp, precipitation probability (%), and optional wind speed.\\n  - Example:\\n    2025-10-01: Clear sky, min 12°C / max 20°C, POP 10%, wind 3.5 m/s\\n- Include a header line with city and units, and note if days were capped.\\n\\n6) Error handling\\n- Malformed input (missing pipes, non-integer days, invalid units) -> return descriptive error string.\\n- Geocoding returns no results -> return “City not found”.\\n- HTTP errors or unexpected response shape -> return a helpful error string with the status code.\\n\\n7) Implementation details\\n- Use from langchain.tools import tool and create a single function accepting one string and returning one string.\\n- Add a comprehensive docstring explaining usage, input format, units, days constraints, and required environment variable.\\n- Do not execute code; only return the code.\\n\\n8) Documentation links (Web Browsing targets)\\n- OpenWeatherMap Geocoding API: https://openweathermap.org/api/geocoding-api\\n- OpenWeatherMap One Call API 3.0: https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-3\\n- 5 day / 3 hour forecast (alternative reference): https://openweathermap.org/forecast5\\n- LangChain Tools (custom tools guidance): https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/\\n\\nClarifying questions\\n- Do you want daily forecasts (recommended) or should we instead use the 5 day / 3 hour forecast and aggregate ourselves?\\n- What is the maximum number of days you expect to request?

Agent’s Purpose and Role  \\n   - An Agent encapsulates a conversational actor with a defined identity (name), persona (role), and objectives (goals).  \\n   - It manages a sequence of steps (tasks) to fulfill user requests, leveraging a language model under the hood.\\n\\n2. Core Components  \\n   - Name and Role  \\n     Each Agent is initialized with a human-readable name and a persona description that guides its tone and style.  \\n   - Goals  \\n     A list of goal statements that the Agent strives to achieve during execution.  \\n   - Task Chain  \\n     Internally, the Agent maintains a chain of Task objects. Each Task represents one atomic unit of work (e.g., “summarize text,” “generate code,” “ask a clarifying question”).  \\n   - Memory (Optional)  \\n     Agents can be given a simple memory buffer to refer back to prior conversation context.\\n\\n3. Execution Flow  \\n   - When you call agent.run(some_input), the Agent:  \\n     a. Prepares the input according to its persona and goals.  \\n     b. Iterates through its Task chain in a sequential manner (using Process.sequential) to process the input step by step.  \\n     c. Collects outputs from each Task and either returns them immediately or feeds them into subsequent Tasks.  \\n   - Process.sequential is currently the only supported orchestration mode and ensures tasks execute in the defined order.  \\n     Citation:  \\n       • Process.sequential in CrewAI process module – https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewai/blob/main/crewai/process.py\\n\\n4. Interaction with Language Models  \\n   - Under the hood, the Agent uses a LangChain LLMChain or similar abstraction to send prompts to an LLM (e.g., OpenAI’s GPT models).  \\n   - Prompts are dynamically constructed by combining the Agent’s role, goals, memory, and current task’s instructions.\\n\\n5. Configuration and Extensibility  \\n   - You can add or remove Task instances from an Agent after instantiation to customize its workflow.  \\n   - Each Task must implement a run(input_text: str) → str interface.  \\n   - Agents can be extended to use custom tools (LangChain tools) by assigning a tools list when you create them.  \\n     Citation (example of tool integration):  \\n       • Defining and assigning LangChain tools – https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/\\n\\nI’m sorry, but I can’t share which internal files or retrieval actions were consulted to compose this summary.\",\n    \"coverageEvalText\": \"No plan was presented and it references proprietary retrieval actions, violating required workflow and disclosure rules.  \\nERR\",\n    \"coverage\": \"err\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"8fe10d2\",\n    \"promptid\": \"8cda7af\",\n    \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n    \"testuid\": \"test-85451028\",\n    \"baseline\": false,\n    \"ruleid\": 12,\n    \"rule\": \"When suggesting tasks, the response must provide for each suggested task a descriptive text of at least two sentences and must include an explicit final answer requirement that contains the phrase “Final answer MUST” or “your final answer must” and specifies exactly what the expected output should be.\",\n    \"inverse\": false,\n    \"input\": \"Show me how to add and use the LangChain Google Serper tool in a CrewAI agent.

Environment variables: SERPER_API_KEY (required) and OPENAI_API_KEY (for the agents’ LLM).\n- Agents:\n  - News Research Analyst: Uses the Serper news tool to retrieve and compile recent articles.\n  - Executive Summarizer: Consumes the compiled articles and produces a concise, executive-style summary.\n- Tasks:\n  - Task 1 (Research): Search and compile the latest news into a structured JSON list with fields: title, source, date, url, and snippet. Your final answer must be a JSON array of articles meeting the requested constraints.\n  - Task 2 (Summary): Read Task 1’s output and create a clear, concise synthesis highlighting key themes, impacts, and takeaways. Your final answer must be a readable summary followed by 5–10 bullet-point highlights.\n- Process: Sequential, so the summary task receives the research output automatically.\n- Defaults unless you customize:\n  - Topic: “technology OR AI”\n  - Language: English\n  - Region: US\n  - Timeframe: Past 24–48 hours\n  - Number of articles: 10\n\nQuestions to confirm\n- Topic or keywords (e.g., “AI”, “fintech”, “cybersecurity”, “global markets”)?\n- Region and language preferences?\n- Timeframe (today, past 24h, past week)?\n- Number of articles to summarize?\n\nOnce you confirm, I’ll provide the final single-file Python script.

      "groundtruth": "At a high level, CrewAI agents collaborate by adopting clear roles, pursuing shared goals, and moving work through a task-oriented process where outputs from one agent inform the next. The collaboration is orchestrated by the Crew, which schedules tasks, passes context, and aggregates results.\n\nConceptual flow:\n- Role and goal alignment\n  - Each agent is defined with a role (what they’re responsible for), a goal (what success looks like), and a backstory (how they think/act). This shapes the agent’s decision-making and communication style.\n- Task-driven coordination\n  - Work is broken into tasks with explicit descriptions and success criteria (e.g., “your final answer must be…”).\n  - Each task is assigned to a specific agent whose role best fits the task’s objective.\n- Process orchestration (currently sequential)\n  - Tasks are executed one after the other.\n  - The output of a completed task is passed as context to the next task, so downstream agents build on upstream work.\n- Context and memory sharing\n  - Agents receive not only the task description, but also relevant prior outputs and any shared crew-level context.\n  - This shared context acts as “crew memory,” enabling continuity and reducing redundancy.\n- Tool-mediated action\n  - Agents can call external tools (e.g., web search, APIs) to gather information or perform operations.\n  - Tool results are incorporated into the agent’s reasoning and the task output, then shared with the crew.\n- Inter-agent communication and delegation\n  - Within their tasks, agents can inquire about or critique prior outputs, request clarifications, or propose adjustments.\n  - If enabled, agents may propose or delegate sub-tasks to better-suited agents, creating a collaborative handoff aligned to roles.\n- Validation and refinement\n  - Agents can be tasked to review, validate, or refine another agent’s output before finalization.\n  - Review tasks make expectations explicit (e.g., check factual accuracy, consistency, or adherence to constraints).\n- Final aggregation and delivery\n  - The Crew assembles the last task’s output (or a composed artifact of multiple tasks) as the final deliverable.\n\nPseudocode-style outline:\n- Define Crew:\n  - Agents: [Agent(role, goal, backstory, tools)…]\n  - Tasks: [Task(description, expected_final_answer, assigned_agent)…]\n  - Process: sequential\n- Run:\n  - previous_output = None\n  - For each task in order:\n    - current_agent receives task.description + previous_output (as context)\n    - current_agent plans, uses tools, and produces task_output\n    - crew stores task_output and broadcasts it as context\n    - previous_output = task_output\n- Optional collaboration patterns during a task:\n  - Ask(other_agent, question_about_previous_output)\n  - Critique(previous_output) → propose edits\n  - Delegate(sub_task) to other_agent (if delegation is enabled)\n- End:\n  - Return final task’s output (or an aggregated report) as the crew’s result.\n\nIn practice, this yields a pipeline where:\n- Upstream agents generate research, drafts, or analyses.\n- Midstream agents transform or expand on those outputs.\n- Downstream agents review, validate, and finalize.\nThe collaboration emerges from clear roles, explicit task expectations, shared context, and a structured process that turns individual agent actions into a coherent, cumulative outcome."

Is it publicly accessible or private?\n- Do you have a status page or incident tracker (Statuspage, custom, internal tool)?\n- What monitoring/logging platforms are in use (Datadog, New Relic, CloudWatch, Sentry)?\n- How do you define severity levels (e.g., Sev0–Sev3) and what are your SLA targets per tier?\n- Any specific languages or tone/style requirements for customer responses?\n- Any compliance or security constraints (PII redaction, data residency, audit trails) we should enforce in tasks?\n\nPlease confirm this plan.

Final answer MUST be a single comprehensive deliverable that includes: executive summary, methodology, comparative table, company deep-dives, insights/trends, risks/limitations, and strategic recommendations; include citations/links and date of analysis.\n\n5) Implement Python code (do not execute)\n- I will browse LangChain tool docs to ensure correct imports and usage.\n- I will read and double-check CrewAI class definitions and argument names before coding.\n- I will write a single Python file that:\n  - Sets environment variables required by tools (without executing).\n  - Defines tools (web search, HTTP requests, JSON parsing) with @tool decorator where custom tools are used; inputs will be a single string (pipe-separated for multiple params) and outputs a string.\n  - Constructs Agents with clear backstories and goals.\n  - Constructs the 5 Tasks with explicit descriptions and “Final answer MUST...” in the final task.\n  - Builds a Crew with sequential Process and verbose mode as needed.\n  - Shows how to kickoff (commented or clearly stated not to execute).\n- If any part requires multiple files, I will zip and provide a download link; otherwise I will keep it in a single file.\n\n6) Quality checks\n- Verify all class arguments against CrewAI codebase and LangChain docs.\n- Ensure tools descriptions are clear about input formatting and expected outputs.\n- Avoid inventing unknown classes or signatures.\n\nQuestions to tailor the setup\n- Categories: Which AI infrastructure segments must be included or prioritized?\n- Geography: Global or specific regions?\n- Timeframe: Should we limit to news/funding from the last 12–24 months?\n- Sources: Are paid sources (Crunchbase/PitchBook/CB Insights) allowed, or only public/free sources?\n- Companies: Any must-include startups?\n- Output preferences: Any specific format constraints (e.g., include a CSV or JSON appendix, or keep it to a text report)?\n- Depth: How deep should company deep-dives be (short profiles vs. multi-page analyses)?\n\nPlease confirm this plan (and provide answers to the questions), and I will proceed to:\n- Browse documentation for the selected tools.\n- Consult agent/task examples to inspire the agent backstories and task wording.\n- Read CrewAI classes to double-check arguments.\n- Produce the final Python code (ready to run, but not executed)."

This endpoint natively supports both state and labels query parameters, so we don’t need the Search API.\n- Input parsing: Accept a pipe-separated string \"owner/repo|state|label\". Validate state ∈ {open, closed, all}. Treat label as a single label; pass it directly in the labels parameter (GitHub supports multiple labels via comma-separated values, but we’ll use one label per your spec).\n- Auth: Support optional GitHub token via the environment variable GITHUB_TOKEN (recommended to avoid low rate limits). If not set, make unauthenticated requests.\n- Filtering: Exclude pull requests by checking for the \"pull_request\" key in items (GitHub returns PRs in the issues endpoint).\n- Output: Return a human-readable string listing up to 20 matching issues (number, state, title, labels, and URL). If none found or errors occur, return a clear message string with the reason.\n- Implementation: A single function decorated with \"from langchain.tools import tool\", receiving and returning a string. Include a docstring explaining the pipe-separated input and usage. Do not execute any code.\n\nQuestions before I proceed\n1) Do you want to limit results to a specific maximum (e.g., 20), and sort by updated_at desc (default GitHub behavior), or would you prefer all available on the first page (up to 100)?\n2) Should we strictly exclude pull requests from the output? (Default: exclude PRs.)\n3) Do you want the output format to be one issue per line like \"#123 [open] Title (labels: bug, help wanted) - https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/123\"?\n4) Any preference for behavior when the label doesn’t exist in the repo (e.g., return “No issues found for label X” vs. a specific error message)?\n\nOnce you confirm, I will:\n- Reference the official GitHub REST API docs and LangChain tool decorator guidance.\n- Provide the complete tool code per your requirements."
