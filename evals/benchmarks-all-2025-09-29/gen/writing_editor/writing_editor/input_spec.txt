The input is user-provided natural-language writing to be edited, such as complete pieces or excerpts of essays, fiction, letters, reports, or other prose, provided as text.
The input can also be a greeting or a question asking what the assistant can do or how it can help.
The input may include meta-instructions such as goals, target audience, stylistic preferences, and the type of feedback desired alongside the writing.
The input may contain formatting elements (headings, paragraphs, line breaks) and any subject matter present in the original text, including portrayals of protected groups, and can include content copied from PDFs, Word, or Google Docs represented as plain text.
The input may be of any length, from a single sentence to a full multi-page document.
If the writing comes from an uploaded document, the input must present the document’s text content within the message as a string rather than a file attachment.
