I’m here to help you edit and improve your writing. I can give line-by-line edits on spelling, grammar, phrasing, and structure, and I can also suggest how to organize your ideas for your audience.\\n\\nA few quick questions to understand your goals:\\n- How long do you want the paragraph to be (one short paragraph or a few)?\\n- Do you want it to be informative, persuasive, or both?\\n- Should it focus on farmers in a specific region, or be general?\\n- Do you plan to include data/statistics, or keep it high-level?\\n\\nOverview of the approach:\\n- I’ll clean up grammar and spelling, tighten phrasing, and make the weather–climate connection clear.\\n- I’ll suggest a simple structure: a clear topic sentence, 1–2 supporting points (examples or data), and a concise concluding idea.\\n- I’ll offer a polished version you can use or adapt.\\n\\nOverall Feedback:\\n- You’re flagging a timely topic and a clear audience. To make this effective for the general public, avoid meta statements (like “I was going to add more later”) in the final paragraph, and connect weather impacts directly to climate change so the cause-and-effect relationship is clear.\\n- Aim for specific examples (droughts, floods, unpredictable seasons) and simple, direct language.\\n- Keep tense consistent and avoid filler phrases (“kind of,” “a lot”) unless they add meaning.\\n\\nSpelling Edits (with explanations):\\n- “effecting” → “affecting”\\n  - “Affecting” means “influencing or having an impact on.” “Effecting” means “causing to happen,” which isn’t the intended meaning here.\\n- “alot” → “a lot”\\n  - “A lot” is two words in standard English.\\n- “its good” → “it’s good”\\n  - Use “it’s” (it is). “Its” is possessive.\\n\\nGrammar and Phrasing Edits (with explanations):\\n- Original: “Weather is effecting farmers alot.”\\n  - Suggested: “Extreme weather is affecting farmers a lot.”\\n  - Why: Correct spelling and verb; add “Extreme” to be more precise. Consider replacing “a lot” with “significantly” or describing how (e.g., “by reducing yields and raising costs”) for specificity.\\n- Original: “The data are scattered and I was going to add more later.”\\n  - Suggested (general public style): “The available data are scattered, and I plan to add more later.”\\n  - Why: “Plan” keeps tense consistent; “available” clarifies what’s scattered. For a finished essay, remove meta-process notes entirely and present one or two specific data points instead.\\n- Original: “It’s kind of messy, and I don’t know if its good.”\\n  - Suggested: “It’s a bit messy, and I’m not sure it reads well.”\\n  - Why: Replace filler (“kind of”) with “a bit,” correct “it’s,” and be specific about what “good” means (clarity/readability). For the final essay, avoid self-assessment and simply present a clean paragraph.\\n\\nStructural Suggestions:\\n- Use a clear 3–4 sentence structure:\\n  1) Topic sentence: connect climate change to weather and farmers.\\n  2) Supporting detail: examples of impacts (droughts, floods, unpredictable seasons).\\n  3) Optional evidence: one clear statistic or observed trend (cite a credible source if you have one).\\n  4) Closing sentence: why it matters or what should happen next (adaptation/support/emissions reductions).\\n- Remove meta commentary (“I was going to add more later”) from the final paragraph. Keep that note in your draft, not in the published text.\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement:\\n- Replace vague phrases (“a lot,” “kind of messy”) with concrete examples.\\n- Clarify the weather–climate link (e.g., “Climate change is intensifying extreme weather…”).\\n- If you include data, choose one or two key numbers with plain-language context and a source.\\n- Use active voice and short sentences to increase readability.\\n\\nFormatting Guidance:\\n- For a short general-public essay, stick to one concise paragraph (3–5 sentences).\\n- Use plain language, avoid jargon, and define terms briefly if needed (e.g., “extreme weather”).\\n- If you expand to multiple paragraphs, add a short subheading and break up ideas for readability.\\n\\nWould you like me to rewrite this into a clean, ready-to-share paragraph now? If so, tell me your preferred tone (informative vs. persuasive) and any region or example you want included. Here’s a neutral, general-public example you could use or tweak:\\n\\nExample revised paragraph:\\nClimate change is intensifying extreme weather, and farmers are feeling the effects. Droughts, floods, and unpredictable seasons reduce yields and raise costs, making harvests less reliable and food prices more volatile. Clear, consistent data help us understand these trends, but the takeaway is already clear: we need to support farmers’ adaptation efforts while reducing emissions to limit future damage.\\n\\nIf you share your target length and any data you want included, I can tailor this further and provide a fully edited version.\",\n    \"metrics\": {\n      \"groundtruth-eval with azure:o4-mini_2025-04-16\": {\n        \"content\": \"{\\\"explanation\\\":\\\"Missing exact headings.\\\",\\\"score\\\":60}\",\n        \"score\": 60\n      }\n    },\n    \"compliance\": \"ok\",\n    \"complianceText\": \"Checked structure, categories, tone—all aligned with description.  \\nOK\",\n    \"isGroundtruth\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"0f950fe\",\n    \"promptid\": \"b7651b1\",\n    \"ruleid\": 2,\n    \"rule\": \"The output must contain a distinct section labeled “Overview” that briefly summarizes the editorial approach and focus areas based on the user’s stated goals and the type of writing (such as essay, fiction, or letter).\",\n    \"inverse\": false,\n    \"testuid\": \"test-89332489\",\n    \"scenario\": \"\",\n    \"baseline\": false,\n    \"testinput\": \"goal: strengthen thesis clarity and persuasive impact type: argumentative essay audience: high school teacher feedback: line-by-line edits and overview text: School uniforms should be adopted because they reduce bullying.

I’m here to help strengthen your thesis clarity and persuasive impact for an argumentative essay.

If you want a planning sentence, you can instead write: “This essay explains how uniforms curb bullying and supports the claim with evidence from schools and research.” But typically, just use a clear thesis and let the body paragraphs provide support.\\n\\n3) Original: “I want stronger transitions and a clearer stance.”\\n   Suggested edit: Remove from the essay.\\n   Why: Also meta-commentary. Replace with an actual clear stance (the revised thesis) and use transitions within and between body paragraphs.\\n\\nOverall Feedback:\\n- Your core claim is solid, but it needs a stronger, more specific thesis that states how uniforms reduce bullying (the mechanism) and previews the points you’ll argue.\\n- Remove self-referential sentences from the draft; replace them with argumentative content.\\n- Use consistent, active voice and topic sentences that directly support the thesis.\\n- Integrate transitions that show logical progression: begin with mechanism, move to evidence, then address counterarguments before concluding.\\n\\nSpelling Edits:\\n- No spelling errors in your text.\\n\\nGrammar Edits:\\n- Add a comma after introductory “However” if you keep that sentence in any future draft: “However, …”\\n- Prefer active voice (“schools should require”) over passive (“should be adopted”) for a stronger, more persuasive tone.\\n- Avoid first-person meta-statements in an argumentative essay unless your assignment encourages reflection.\\n\\nStructural Suggestions:\\n- Introduction: Hook, brief context, precise thesis.\\n- Body paragraph 1 (Mechanism): Explain how uniforms reduce visible status markers and remove appearance-based targets for bullying.\\n- Body paragraph 2 (Evidence): Present examples or data from school districts or studies showing reduced bullying incidents after uniform adoption.\\n- Body paragraph 3 (Counterargument and rebuttal): Acknowledge concerns (cost, individuality) and rebut with solutions (assistance programs, optional accessories, focus on safety).\\n- Conclusion: Restate thesis in fresh words, synthesize key points, and end with a call to action or implication (e.g., schools should pilot uniform policies with equity supports).\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement:\\n- Define bullying briefly (appearance-based teasing, brand shaming) to focus your claim.\\n- Specify the scope (e.g., public middle and high schools) to avoid overgeneralization.\\n- Support claims with credible sources (district reports, education research) or real-world examples; avoid overclaiming causation without evidence.\\n- Use clear topic sentences that tie directly back to the thesis at the start of each body paragraph.\\n- Maintain parallel structure when listing reasons: “reduces status competition, removes appearance-based targets, and fosters a sense of belonging.”\\n\\nFormatting Guidance:\\n- Use a standard argumentative format: double-spaced, readable font, clear paragraph breaks, and consistent heading style if required by your teacher.\\n- If citing sources, include in-text citations and a works cited page (MLA is common for high school).\\n- Keep paragraphs focused: one main idea per paragraph with a strong topic sentence and concluding link back to the thesis.\\n\\nStronger thesis options (choose one or adapt):\\n- “Public schools should require uniforms because standardizing dress reduces status competition, removes appearance-based targets for bullying, and builds a culture of belonging.”\\n- “To make campuses safer, schools should require uniforms; by removing visible status markers, uniforms cut the fuel for bullying and refocus attention on learning.”\\n- “Schools should adopt uniforms to reduce bullying: when clothing is standardized, students have fewer reasons to judge, isolate, or harass peers over appearance or brand.”\\n\\nSample introduction paragraph (ready to use or adapt):\\n- “No student should dread walking into school because of what they wear. Bullying often targets appearance—brands, styles, and price tags become excuses to judge and exclude. Schools should require uniforms because standardizing dress reduces status competition and appearance-based bullying. By removing visible markers that separate students into ‘haves’ and ‘have-nots,’ uniforms help create a more respectful environment where attention can return to learning.”\\n\\nSample topic sentences and transitions:\\n- Body 1: “First, uniforms reduce status competition by eliminating the brand and style differences that often trigger teasing.”\\n- Body 2: “Moreover, schools that adopt uniform policies report fewer appearance-based conflicts, suggesting uniforms help curb bullying.”\\n- Body 3 (counterargument): “Critics argue that uniforms limit self-expression and can be costly; however, schools can allow personal accessories and provide assistance programs, maintaining safety without sacrificing equity.”\\n- Conclusion: “Ultimately, by removing appearance-based targets and promoting belonging, uniforms are a practical step schools can take to reduce bullying.”\\n\\nWould you like me to rewrite your thesis, introduction, and an outline for the full essay based on your assignment length and requirements?

Your draft mentions “email,” but your goal says “business letter.\\n- What action do you want the recipient to take (schedule a call, request a proposal, reply with questions)?\\n- Do you have a specific recipient name or title to address?\\n\\nOverview of editorial guidance I’ll provide\\n- Modernize the salutation and make it more personal and professional.\\n- Fix grammar and punctuation issues (subject–verb agreement, comma splices, plural nouns).\\n- Align pronouns and tone (consistent “we” vs. “I”).\\n- Strengthen clarity and add a specific call to action.\\n- Tailor wording for either a formal letter or a concise email format.\\n\\nCategorized feedback\\n\\nOverall Feedback\\n- The tone is polite but generic. Professional readers prefer clear value statements and a specific next step.\\n- Replace outdated or impersonal salutations (“Dear Sir or Madam”) with a name or role-based greeting.\\n- Remove or shorten cliché openers (“I hope this email finds you well”) to keep the message concise and professional.\\n- Make the call to action specific (e.g., propose a time for a call or invite them to request a proposal).\\n\\nSpelling Edits\\n- “Please let me know if you have any question.” → “Please let me know if you have any questions.”\\n  Reason: “Questions” should be plural when referring to any number of potential questions.\\n\\nGrammar Edits\\n- “We offer services that is tailored to your needs” → “We offer services that are tailored to your needs”\\n  Reason: Subject–verb agreement. “Services” is plural, so use “are.”\\n- “...and we want to ensure your satisfaction, we will be happy to help.” → Split into two sentences or use a coordinating conjunction.\\n  Reason: Comma splice. Two independent clauses joined by a comma should be separated by a period, semicolon, or conjunction.\\n- Pronoun consistency: You switch from “we” to “me” in the last sentence.\\n  Suggestion: Use “we” throughout if writing on behalf of the company, or “I” if writing as a representative.\\n\\nStructural Suggestions\\n- Use a clear, direct opener that states your value: what you do and why it matters to the client.\\n- Follow with a brief assurance or benefit (commitment to satisfaction).\\n- End with a specific call to action (propose a meeting, invite a reply, provide contact details).\\n- If this is a letter, include a professional sign-off and full contact details. If it’s an email, add a relevant subject line and keep paragraphs short.\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement\\n- Add one sentence describing the specific services or outcomes (e.g., “We help [type of client] achieve [result] through [service].”).\\n- Include a brief credibility element (e.g., years in business, notable clients, or a quick metric).\\n- Offer a concrete next step with a suggested time (e.g., “Could we schedule a 15-minute call next week?”).\\n- Personalize the greeting with the recipient’s name or role.\\n\\nFormatting Guidance\\n- Business letter:\\n  - Your Name, Title, Company, Address, Phone, Email\\n  - Date\\n  - Recipient Name, Title, Company, Address\\n  - Salutation\\n  - 2–3 short paragraphs (value, benefit, CTA)\\n  - Professional closing (Sincerely/Best regards) + signature block\\n- Business email:\\n  - Subject line (clear benefit, concise)\\n  - Greeting with name\\n  - 2 short paragraphs (value + CTA)\\n  - Signature with full contact info\\n\\nLine-by-line edits with reasoning\\n\\nOriginal: “Dear Sir or Madam,”\\n- Edit: “Dear [Recipient’s Name],” or “Dear [Title/Team],”\\n- Reason: “Dear Sir or Madam” is dated and impersonal. Using a name or role feels more professional and client-focused.\\n\\nOriginal: “I hope this email finds you well.”\\n- Edit options:\\n  - Remove entirely for concision.\\n  - Or: “I hope you’re well.”\\n- Reason: This phrase is common but can feel generic. Many professional readers prefer getting to the point.\\n\\nOriginal: “We offer services that is tailored to your needs, and we want to ensure your satisfaction, we will be happy to help.”\\n- Edit: “Our services are tailored to your needs, and we are committed to your satisfaction. We would be happy to discuss how we can support your goals.”\\n- Reason: Fix subject–verb agreement; eliminate comma splice; strengthen tone by clarifying benefits and using parallel structure.\\n\\nOriginal: “Please let me know if you have any question.”\\n- Edit: “Please let us know a convenient time to talk, or reply with any questions.”\\n- Reason: Pluralize “questions,” make the CTA specific, and keep pronouns consistent.\\n\\nWould you like me to generate the edited text?\\nBelow are two polished versions you can use immediately.

In the essay itself, don’t state this intent—demonstrate it through choices, actions, and reflective insight.\\n\\n3) Original: “I’m not sure if my anecdotes connect to my central message or if the tone fits my audience.”\\n   - Edited: “I’m working to ensure my anecdotes reinforce a clear central message and suit a college admissions audience.”\\n   - Reasoning: More assertive and concise (“working to ensure” + “reinforce a clear central message”). In the essay, replace uncertainty with clear transitions and reflective sentences that explicitly tie each anecdote to your message.\\n\\nOverall Feedback\\n- Authenticity: Avoid general claims (“resilience,” “curiosity”) unless you ground them in vivid, specific moments. Specifics make you memorable and humble.\\n- Concision: Replace meta statements (what you want to show) with actions and reflection. Trim filler (“I want to,” “I’m not sure if”) and use strong verbs.\\n- Tone for admissions: Confident, reflective, and collaborative. Show impact on others or learning from setbacks. Avoid grandiose language and excessive self-praise.\\n- Connection: After each anecdote, include a 1–2 sentence reflection that ties it back to your central message and forward to your future goals in biology.\\n\\nSpelling Edits\\n- No spelling errors in the lines you shared.\\n- Note: “college admissions committee” is your audience; if you reference them, use “college admissions readers” or “the admissions committee” for clarity and consistency.\\n\\nGrammar Edits\\n- Strengthen verb choice: “shaped” or “cultivated” instead of “taught me” for a smoother, less didactic tone.\\n- Avoid meta phrasing: Instead of “I want to show,” demonstrate through a specific example and reflective insight.\\n- Parallel structure: When you list two aims (“connect to my central message” and “fit my audience”), make them parallel—e.g., “reinforce a clear central message and suit a college admissions audience.”\\n\\nStructural Suggestions\\n- Suggested outline for a concise, authentic personal statement (650 words max):\\n  1) Hook: A specific moment that reveals curiosity or resilience (one vivid image or action).\\n  2) Pivot: Brief context—small-town background—without clichés; tie the moment to your values.\\n  3) Biology Focus: One or two concrete experiences (experiment, project, fieldwork). Use sensory or technical details sparingly to show competence.\\n  4) Reflection: What you learned (intellectual growth, ethics, collaboration, humility). This is where you keep tone grounded and avoid arrogance.\\n  5) Impact and Future: How these experiences shape what you hope to explore in college biology (not name-dropping programs yet, just direction).\\n  6) Closing: Return to the opening image or idea, showing continuity and purpose.\\n\\n- How to connect anecdotes:\\n  - After each anecdote, add a reflection sentence starting with “This taught me…” or “I realized…” then end with a forward-looking line: “Because of this, I now…” This explicitly ties the story to the central message and your trajectory.\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement\\n- Replace abstractions with specifics: One concrete detail (equipment used, problem solved, a question you asked) communicates more than labels.\\n- Show humility through process: Include a small failure or misconception you corrected. Admissions readers value teachability.\\n- Use active verbs: “analyzed,” “cultured,” “designed,” “mentored,” “iterated” instead of passive phrasing.\\n- Limit themes: Focus on 1–2 core ideas (e.g., curiosity + collaborative problem-solving). Too many themes dilute impact.\\n- Audience fit: Emphasize learning, ethics, and collaboration over prestige or competition.\\n\\nFormatting Guidance\\n- Common App essays: Plain text; paragraph breaks are preserved, but extra formatting (bold/italics) is not. Aim for 3–5 short paragraphs.\\n- Keep line lengths readable; avoid long blocks of text. Use a clear, simple font when drafting (for your own readability).\\n- No title needed unless it genuinely adds meaning; you can start directly with the hook.\\n- Avoid quotation-heavy openings; one brief, concrete sentence is stronger than a long setup.\\n\\nWould you like further assistance?\\n- If you share your draft and the specific anecdotes, I can provide detailed line-by-line edits and tighten the prose while preserving your voice.\\n- I can also draft a revised opening paragraph that balances authenticity and humility.\\n\\nOffer to generate edited text\\n- If helpful, I can turn your three meta sentences into a concise thesis-style opening you could adapt:\\n  - “Raised in a town where answers weren’t handed to me, I learned to ask better questions. That habit now shapes how I approach biology—curious, persistent, and grounded in what I can learn from mistakes.”\\n- Or, send your full draft, and I’ll rewrite it incorporating all suggested changes.\",\n    \"metrics\": {\n      \"groundtruth-eval with azure:o4-mini_2025-04-16\": {\n        \"content\": \"{\\\"explanation\\\":\\\"Mislabels sections and edit lists\\\",\\\"score\\\":30}\",\n        \"score\": 30\n      }\n    },\n    \"compliance\": \"ok\",\n    \"complianceText\": \"Fits the described structure: initial questions, overview, line edits, all feedback categories, offers next steps.  \\nOK\",\n    \"isGroundtruth\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"e83089f\",\n    \"promptid\": \"b7651b1\",\n    \"ruleid\": 5,\n    \"rule\": \"The “Spelling Edits” section must present itemized bullet points, each bullet identifying a specific misspelling from the user’s text, supplying the corrected spelling, and explaining the reason for the correction.\",\n    \"inverse\": false,\n    \"testuid\": \"test-31065314\",\n    \"scenario\": \"\",\n    \"baseline\": false,\n    \"testinput\": \"goal: fix spelling errors and polish tone type: cover letter audience: hiring manager feedback: spelling-focused text: I am definately interested in the position and hope to recieve a response soon.

I can help with grammar-focused, line-by-line edits for your reflective essay aimed at a teacher. Before we begin, do you prefer US or UK English? (For example, in US English “team” is usually singular—“the team was”—while UK English often uses plural—“the team were.”) Also, would you like minimal edits only, or a slightly polished rewrite for clarity?\\n\\nOverview of what I’ll do\\n- Focus on grammar, tense consistency, subject–verb agreement, modifiers, and punctuation.\\n- Keep your reflective tone and make phrasing clear and idiomatic for a teacher audience.\\n- Provide line-by-line edits with reasons, then offer a clean revised version if you want it.\\n\\nOverall Feedback\\n- Your ideas are clear and sequential: you present a result, describe work and effort, and end with team celebration.\\n- The main grammar issues are subject–verb agreement, inconsistent tense, a dangling modifier, and a comma splice.\\n- A few phrases can be made more idiomatic and precise (e.g., “successful in the project” → “successful on the project” or “successful in completing the project”).\\n\\nSpelling Edits\\n- No spelling errors detected.\\n\\nGrammar Edits (line-by-line with explanations)\\n1) Original: “The results shows that I was successful in the project.”\\n   - Edit: “The results show that I was successful on the project.”\\n   - Why: “Results” is plural, so use “show,” not “shows.” “Successful on the project” is more idiomatic than “successful in the project.” Alternative: “The results show that I was successful in completing the project,” which is even clearer.\\n\\n2) Original: “I was working on the report and finish it yesterday.”\\n   - Edit (simple past for consistency): “I worked on the report and finished it yesterday.”\\n   - Why: Keep the same tense within the sentence. “Yesterday” calls for simple past. “Was working … finished” can work, but the mismatch (“was working” vs. “finish”) is incorrect; if you keep the progressive, make it “was working … and finished.”\\n\\n3) Original: “Running quickly, the finish line seemed far.”\\n   - Edit: “While I was running quickly, the finish line seemed far away.”\\n   - Why: The original has a dangling modifier—“Running quickly” needs to modify “I,” not “the finish line.” Adding “away” is the natural collocation with “far.”\\n\\n4) Original: “The team were excited, we celebrated and it was great.”\\n   - US English edit: “The team was excited. We celebrated, and it was great.”\\n   - UK English edit: “The team were excited. We celebrated, and it was great.”\\n   - Why: Fix the comma splice by splitting into two sentences or using a semicolon. In US English, “team” is treated as singular (“was”); in UK English, plural (“were”). Keeping “it was great” is acceptable, though you could make it more specific (e.g., “and it felt great” or “and it was a rewarding moment”).\\n\\nStructural Suggestions\\n- Consider linking the metaphor (“finish line”) more directly to the project for coherence: e.g., “Even though I was moving quickly to meet the deadline, the ‘finish line’ still felt far away.”\\n- You can combine related ideas for smoother flow: for instance, connect success to the effort and celebration:\\n  - “The results show that I was successful on the project. I worked on the report and finished it yesterday. While I was running quickly, the finish line still seemed far away, but in the end the team was excited. We celebrated, and it felt great.”\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement\\n- Replace vague phrasing like “it was great” with a more specific reflection (e.g., “It felt rewarding to see our hard work pay off”).\\n- Clarify the timeline: if “running quickly” is a metaphor for working toward the deadline, say so explicitly.\\n- Keep tense consistent throughout (past tense for completed actions).\\n\\nFormatting Guidance\\n- For a reflective essay to a teacher, use first person consistently and past tense for completed events.\\n- Aim for paragraph form with clear transitions (e.g., “First,” “Later,” “In the end”).\\n- Avoid comma splices; join independent clauses with a period, semicolon, or a coordinating conjunction with a comma.\\n\\nWould you like me to produce a clean, edited version now?

To make your narrative essay consistent, I can standardize tense and tone, explain each change line by line, and suggest structural and formatting improvements.\\n\\nBefore I proceed, two quick questions to tailor the edit:\\n- Tense preference: Would you like the whole piece in simple past (because the event happened “yesterday”) or in vivid present (present-tense storytelling)? I can do either, but simple past is most typical for this kind of narrative.\\n- Tone preference: Would you like a neutral, semi-formal tone or a more casual, conversational tone? Given your audience (“general readers”), semi-formal/neutral is often best.\\n\\nOverview of editorial guidance:\\n- Choose a single dominant tense (recommendation: simple past) and make all verbs align.\\n- Unify tone by removing slang and using clear, neutral wording.\\n- Smooth out sentence structure (replace the semicolon with a period, clarify pronouns like “it,” and maintain parallel verb forms).\\n- Keep evaluation of your writing (comments about structure/style) in the same tense for consistency, unless you want a deliberate contrast.\\n\\nLine-by-line edits with reasons:\\n1) Original: “Yesterday I walk to the beach and I am watching the waves; later I will wrote about it.”\\n   Edit: “Yesterday, I walked to the beach and watched the waves. Later, I planned to write about the experience.”\\n   Why:\\n   - “walk” → “walked” and “am watching” → “watched” to align with simple past (“Yesterday” sets the timeline).\\n   - Replace the semicolon with a period for clarity and flow.\\n   - “will wrote” is ungrammatical; “planned to write” matches past time and reads smoothly.\\n   - “it” is vague; “the experience” is clearer for readers.\\n\\n2) Original: “I'm gonna add more details because it felt awesome, but the structure is all over the place and I start with the ending.”\\n   Edit: “I intended to add more details because it felt wonderful, but the structure was all over the place, and I started with the ending.”\\n   Why:\\n   - “I’m gonna” → “I intended to” to standardize tone (semi-formal) and tense (past).\\n   - “awesome” → “wonderful” for a neutral tone suitable for general readers.\\n   - “is” → “was” and “start” → “started” to maintain past tense.\\n   - Add a comma before “and” to separate independent clauses and improve readability.\\n\\n3) Original: “The style switches between casual and formal.”\\n   Edit: “The style shifted between casual and formal.”\\n   Why:\\n   - “switches” → “shifted” to keep past tense consistent.\\n   - Keeps your point while aligning tone and tense with the rest.\\n\\nCategorized feedback:\\n\\nOverall Feedback:\\n- The main issue is inconsistent tense (present, future, and past mixed) and shifting tone (slang vs. formal). Choosing simple past and a neutral, semi-formal voice will make the narrative clear and cohesive for general readers.\\n- Clarify vague references (like “it”) and avoid unnecessary punctuation complexity for short, straightforward sentences.\\n\\nSpelling Edits:\\n- “gonna” → “going to” (or, better here, “intended to”) because “gonna” is colloquial and not ideal for a general-audience essay.\\n- No other spelling errors found.\\n\\nGrammar Edits:\\n- Tense standardization: change “walk,” “am watching,” “will wrote,” “is,” “start,” “switches” to past forms (“walked,” “watched,” “planned to write,” “was,” “started,” “shifted”).\\n- Verb form correction: “will wrote” is incorrect. Use “planned to write” or “would write” (future-in-the-past).\\n- Punctuation: Replace the semicolon with a period for clarity; add a comma before “and” when joining independent clauses.\\n\\nStructural Suggestions:\\n- If your essay “starts with the ending,” decide if that’s intentional (a hook) or accidental. If intentional, signal it clearly: for example, begin with a brief reflection and then transition to the chronological story.\\n- Otherwise, consider chronological order: open with arriving at the beach, describe sensory details (sight, sound, feeling), then conclude with your plan to write about it and what you learned.\\n- Clarify “the experience” rather than “it,” and add one or two concrete sensory images to anchor the narrative.\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement:\\n- Add specific details to elevate style: mention the color/texture of the waves, the wind, the scent of salt, or how the water’s rhythm affected your mood.\\n- Replace general adjectives (“wonderful”) with precise ones that match your experience (“calming,” “invigorating,” “overwhelming”).\\n- Consider a brief reflective sentence at the end tying the experience to why you wanted to write about it.\\n\\nFormatting Guidance:\\n- Use short, clear paragraphs. For a brief narrative: 1) arrival and first impressions; 2) watching the waves; 3) reflection and writing intention.\\n- Avoid excessive semicolons in simple narrative prose. Use periods and commas to keep rhythm steady.\\n- Keep consistent voice throughout; if you include meta-remarks about your structure, keep them in the same tense as the narrative or set them off as a separate paragraph.\\n\\nWould you like me to apply these changes and generate a clean, edited version in:\\n- Simple past, semi-formal tone; or\\n- Present tense (for vivid immediacy), semi-formal tone?\\n\\nIf you prefer, I can provide both versions so you can choose.\",\n    \"metrics\": {\n      \"groundtruth-eval with azure:o4-mini_2025-04-16\": {\n        \"content\": \"{\\\"score\\\":60,\\\"explanation\\\":\\\"Missing exact “Overview” heading and misuses bullet rules\\\"}\",\n        \"score\": 60\n      }\n    },\n    \"compliance\": \"ok\",\n    \"complianceText\": \"Meets the required structure: asks questions, overview, line-by-line edits, categorized feedback, and offers final edit.  \\nOK\",\n    \"isGroundtruth\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"d74a393\",\n    \"promptid\": \"b7651b1\",\n    \"ruleid\": 9,\n    \"rule\": \"The “Structural Suggestions” section must provide concrete recommendations for reordering, combining, expanding, or trimming parts of the writing, and each recommendation must include an explanation of how it improves coherence, flow, or argument.\",\n    \"inverse\": false,\n    \"testuid\": \"test-10155443\",\n    \"scenario\": \"\",\n    \"baseline\": false,\n    \"testinput\": \"goal: improve organization type: research summary audience: instructor feedback: structural suggestions text: paragraph1: The results section lists three key findings, then I introduce my research question. paragraph2: Background information appears after the conclusion, and some duplicated points appear in both sections. paragraph3: Methods are briefly mentioned at the end, although they should be earlier.\",\n    \"model\": \"gpt-5-2025-08-07\",\n    \"input\": \"goal: improve organization type: research summary audience: instructor feedback: structural suggestions text: paragraph1: The results section lists three key findings, then I introduce my research question. paragraph2: Background information appears after the conclusion, and some duplicated points appear in both sections. paragraph3: Methods are briefly mentioned at the end, although they should be earlier.\",\n    \"output\": \"Quick questions so I tailor the edit:\\n- Do you have a required word count or section headings for this research summary?\\n- Are you using a specific citation style (APA, MLA, Chicago)?\\n- Does your instructor require particular sections (e.g., Research Question, Background, Methods, Results, Conclusion), or is the structure flexible?\\n\\nOverview of my approach:\\n- Because this is a research summary for an instructor, I’ll prioritize clarity, logical flow, and standard academic ordering: Research Question → Background → Methods → Results → Discussion/Conclusion.\\n- I’ll give line-by-line edits to the three sentences you shared and explain the reasoning.\\n- I’ll provide structural suggestions to eliminate duplication, fix section order, and improve transitions.\\n- I’ll finish with formatting guidance typical for a short research summary and offer to rewrite the piece.\\n\\nOverall Feedback:\\n- Main issue is section order: the research question should come before results, background should not follow the conclusion, and methods should precede results.\\n- Remove duplication between background and conclusion; each section should have a distinct purpose (context vs. synthesis/implications).\\n- Use consistent tense: past tense for methods and results, present tense for the research question and general claims.\\n- Prefer clear signposting (topic sentences and headings) and avoid informal sequencing phrases like “then.”\\n\\nSpelling Edits:\\n- No spelling errors in the three sentences.

Before I dive in, a couple quick questions so I can tailor the edits:\\n- About how long do you want the speech to be (e.g., 1–2 minutes, 3–5 minutes)?\\n- What tone are you aiming for: collaborative and solution-focused, or more urgent and assertive?\\n- Do you want to propose any specific actions (e.g., homework guidelines, no-homework nights, coordination across departments)?\\n\\nOverview of the editorial guidance I’ll provide\\n- Make the statement clear, respectful, and persuasive for teachers and a principal.\\n- Fix grammar and sentence structure (comma splice, subject–verb agreement).\\n- Strengthen word choice to avoid overly negative phrasing (“complaining”) and emphasize shared goals.\\n- Offer a simple outline and concrete, audience-aware proposals you could include.\\n\\nOverall Feedback\\n- Audience alignment: Since you’re persuading teachers and the principal, use collaborative language that recognizes their professional expertise and shared commitment to student learning. Replace “complaining” with “expressing concerns” or “reporting challenges.”\\n- Clarity and purpose: State your thesis succinctly: homework supports learning, but it should be balanced and purposeful. Then quickly define what “balance” means (e.g., reasonable limits, coordination, quality over quantity).\\n- Solution-focused approach: Move beyond the problem to propose practical, actionable steps the committee can adopt. Emphasize benefits for teachers (better completion quality, fewer burnout-related issues, more meaningful class time).\\n- Structure: Use a clear speech flow—acknowledge concerns, present evidence or observations, propose solutions, invite collaboration, and end with a respectful call to action.\\n\\nSpelling Edits\\n- “we needs” → “we need”\\n  - Explanation: Subject–verb agreement; “we” takes the base form “need.”\\n\\nGrammar Edits\\n- Comma splice: “Students are complaining about too much homework, I argue…” joins two independent clauses with a comma.\\n  - Fix with a conjunction or punctuation:\\n    - “…too much homework, and I argue…”\\n    - “…too much homework; I argue…”\\n    - Or split into two sentences.\\n- Word order and parallelism: “but also we needs balance” is awkward and ungrammatical.\\n  - Smoother: “but we also need balance.”\\n- Tone refinement (not grammar but important for audience): “complaining” can sound dismissive. Prefer “expressing concerns” or “reporting that the workload feels heavy.”\\n\\nStructural Suggestions\\n- Suggested outline for a short persuasive speech:\\n  1. Opening: Acknowledge shared goals (student learning, skill-building) and the role of homework.\\n  2. Problem statement: Students are reporting that the volume/timing of homework can feel overwhelming, which impacts well-being and quality of learning.\\n  3. Evidence/observations: Briefly reference observations, survey data, or examples (e.g., overlapping due dates across departments).\\n  4. Proposal: Define “balance” and offer concrete steps (reasonable time estimates, coordination, purposeful assignments).\\n  5. Benefits: Explain how these steps improve outcomes for students and teachers (better engagement, higher-quality work).\\n  6. Call to action: Invite the committee to pilot guidelines or form a working group.\\n- Keep paragraphs short and use transitions (“First,” “In addition,” “Therefore”) to guide listeners.\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement\\n- Define “necessary”: Specify why homework matters (practice, reinforcement, self-management).\\n- Define “balance”: Offer specifics (e.g., weekly time caps by grade level, no-homework nights before major tests, coordination across departments to avoid stacking, focus on quality over quantity).\\n- Include one brief anecdote or data point to humanize the issue.\\n- Anticipate objections: Acknowledge that some practice is essential and propose flexible approaches (e.g., optional challenge problems, choice in assignments).\\n- Use rhetorical strategies: Parallel structure (“Purposeful, proportional, and predictable”), a concise triad, and a clear call to action.\\n\\nFormatting Guidance\\n- For a spoken draft:\\n  - Use short sentences and line breaks where you want pauses.\\n  - Add transitions to signpost your points.\\n  - Emphasize key phrases by placing them at the end of sentences for impact.\\n  - Aim for 1–3 minutes depending on meeting constraints; practice out loud to adjust pacing.\\n\\nLine-by-line edits of your sentence\\n- Original: “Students are complaining about too much homework, I argue that homework is necessary but also we needs balance.”\\n- Edited (basic fix, formal tone):\\n  - “Many students are expressing concerns about the amount of homework, and I argue that homework is necessary, but we also need balance.”\\n  - Reasoning: Replaces “complaining” with “expressing concerns” (respectful); fixes comma splice with “and”; adds a comma before “but” for readability; corrects “we needs” to “we need.”\\n- Edited (more persuasive and audience-aware):\\n  - “Many students have reported that the volume of homework can feel overwhelming. Homework is essential for learning, and we can strengthen its impact by ensuring a better balance.”\\n  - Reasoning: Splits into two sentences to improve clarity; adds purpose (“essential for learning”); reframes “balance” as improving impact, which aligns with educator goals.\\n- Edited (concise thesis statement):\\n  - “Homework is essential, but it works best when it is purposeful, proportional, and coordinated.”\\n  - Reasoning: Tight triad provides a clear, memorable standard.\\n\\nWould you like me to generate the edited speech?\\n- I can expand this into a 1–2 minute speech tailored to your audience with specific proposals and a respectful call to action.

Conclusion: Science is cool.\",\n    \"output\": \"Structural Suggestions\\n\\n- Remove the section labels and merge into a single, concise paragraph.\\n  - Concrete change: Delete “Intro:”, “Body:”, and “Conclusion:” and combine the sentences into one cohesive paragraph.\\n  - Effect on coherence: Eliminating labels and merging the content creates a smooth flow from idea to support to conclusion, making the piece read like a unified thought rather than three disconnected parts.\\n\\n- Reorder to foreground the thesis and connect it directly to the evidence.\\n  - Concrete change: Begin with a thesis that explains why you love science, then follow with the evidence (failures and successes), and end with a reflective conclusion.\\n  - Proposed order:\\n    1) “I love science because it teaches me through both failure and success.”\\n    2) “My experiments sometimes fail, but I learn from them; other times they succeed, and that keeps me motivated.”\\n    3) “That balance is why science is cool.”\\n  - Effect on coherence: Starting with a clear reason (“because…”) ties the opening to the middle. The conclusion then echoes the thesis with a causal link, reducing repetition and making the logic explicit.\\n\\n- Trim redundant phrasing and replace the generic conclusion with a reflective echo of the main point.\\n  - Concrete change: Replace “Science is cool.” with “That balance is why science is cool.” or “This is what makes science exciting to me.”\\n  - Effect on coherence: The conclusion refers back to the body’s content, which strengthens unity and avoids a generic statement that doesn’t connect to the prior sentence.\\n\\n- Combine and vary sentences to improve flow and clarity.\\n  - Concrete change: Merge the body idea into a compound sentence with a transition: “Although my experiments sometimes fail, others succeed, and both help me learn.”\\n  - Effect on coherence: Using “although” and “and” signals contrast and connection, guiding the reader through your reasoning and making the paragraph feel purposeful rather than list-like.\\n\\n- Optional alternative structure (keep three sentences but add transitions and cause-effect):\\n  - Concrete change:\\n    1) “I love science.”\\n    2) “Although my experiments sometimes fail, others succeed, and I learn from both.”\\n    3) “That balance is what makes science exciting to me.”\\n  - Effect on coherence: This preserves the original brevity while adding logical progression; each sentence leads naturally to the next.\\n\\nWould you like me to generate a polished version based on these suggestions? Here are two quick rewrites you can choose from:\\n\\n- Single-paragraph version: “I love science because it teaches me through both failure and success. My experiments sometimes fail, but I learn from them; other times they succeed, and that keeps me motivated. That balance is why science is cool.”\\n\\n- Three-sentence version: “I love science. Although my experiments sometimes fail, others succeed, and I learn from both.

I can help you edit for grammar, style, structure, clarity, and evidence. Before we dive in, could you tell me:\\n- What type of piece this is (school essay, article, speech, etc.) and the target audience?\\n- Any length or format requirements (MLA/APA, word count)?\\n- The tone you’re aiming for (neutral, persuasive, informative)?\\n- Whether you’re allowed or required to include sources (e.g., IPCC, NASA, peer-reviewed journals)?\\n\\nOverview of how I’ll help\\n- Clarify your thesis and main claims.\\n- Strengthen evidence by adding credible data and examples.\\n- Smooth transitions and paragraph structure to fix choppiness.\\n- Adjust tone for credibility and coherence.\\n- Correct grammar, spelling, and tense consistency.\\n- Offer formatting tips and, if you want, rewrite the piece with all changes applied.\\n\\nBecause I don’t yet have your full text, I’ll give targeted guidance based on your summary and demonstrate with the line you provided. If you paste the full draft, I can give line-by-line edits across the whole piece.\\n\\nOverall Feedback\\n- Your core claim (“climate change is real”) needs support from credible sources and specific data to be persuasive. Readers expect evidence, definitions, and clear reasoning.\\n- Paragraphs should each focus on a single idea with a topic sentence, evidence, and analysis. Choppiness often comes from abrupt transitions, mixed ideas in one paragraph, or insufficient explanation between claims.\\n- Maintain a clear, neutral, and evidence-driven tone. Avoid overly emotional language; prioritize accuracy, citations, and logic.\\n\\nSpelling Edits\\n- “The argument say” should be “The argument says.” Reason: subject-verb agreement; “argument” (singular) takes “says.”\\n- No spelling errors in the provided sentence, but watch for common climate-related terms:\\n  - “greenhouse gases” (two words)\\n  - “carbon dioxide” (not “carbon di-oxide”)\\n  - “Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)” capitalization and acronym\\n  - “peer-reviewed” hyphenation\\n\\nGrammar Edits\\n- Original: “The argument say climate change is real but I don’t provide any data and the paragraphs is choppy.”\\n  - Edit: “The argument says climate change is real, but I don’t provide any data, and the paragraphs are choppy.”\\n  - Reasons:\\n    - Subject-verb agreement: “argument says”\\n    - Commas for compound sentence and clarity before “but” and to separate clauses\\n    - Plural verb for “paragraphs are”\\n    - Parallel structure: align verb forms (“is real,” “don’t provide,” “are choppy”)\\n- Use consistent tense. In analytical essays, present tense is common (“Research shows…,” “This evidence indicates…”).\\n- Prefer active voice for clarity: “The data show…” instead of “It is shown by data…”\\n\\nStructural Suggestions\\n- Use a clear structure:\\n  - Introduction: define climate change briefly, present your thesis (“Climate change is real because X, Y, and Z”), and preview main points.\\n  - Body paragraph 1: Physical evidence (global temperature rise, ice melt). Include one or two specific data points.\\n  - Body paragraph 2: Mechanism (greenhouse effect, CO2 trends). Explain cause-and-effect with sources.\\n  - Body paragraph 3: Impacts (sea-level rise, extreme weather). Use recent examples and studies.\\n  - Body paragraph 4 (optional): Address a counterargument (e.g., natural variability) and refute with evidence.\\n  - Conclusion: restate thesis, synthesize insights, and end with implications or a call to informed understanding.\\n- Within each paragraph:\\n  - Topic sentence stating the claim.\\n  - Evidence (data, studies) with citation.\\n  - Analysis linking evidence to your claim (“This matters because…”).\\n  - Concluding sentence that transitions to the next paragraph.\\n- Add signpost transitions:\\n  - Between paragraphs: “First,” “Additionally,” “In contrast,” “Moreover,” “Consequently.”\\n  - Within paragraphs: “For example,” “Specifically,” “This suggests,” “As a result.”\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement\\n- Clarity: Define key terms (e.g., “climate change,” “greenhouse gases,” “anomaly”) the first time you use them. Avoid vague phrases like “scientists say” and specify sources.\\n- Evidence: Incorporate reputable data (e.g., IPCC Assessment Reports, NASA GISS temperature records, NOAA sea-level trends, peer-reviewed studies). Include numbers with dates and units. Example: “Global mean surface temperature has increased by approximately 1.1°C since the late 19th century (IPCC, 2023).”\\n- Examples: Use concrete, recent case studies to illustrate trends (e.g., “The 2023 Canadian wildfires released X megatonnes of CO2,” or “Arctic sea ice extent has declined by ~13% per decade since 1979.”).\\n- Transitions: Bridge your ideas with signposting and summary sentences to avoid choppiness. End each paragraph by linking back to the thesis and foreshadowing the next point.\\n- Tone: Aim for measured, objective language. Replace emotionally charged wording with precise, sourced statements. Acknowledge uncertainties where appropriate, and include a brief counterargument section to increase credibility.\\n- Beyond error correction: Consider adding visual aids (if permitted), such as a graph of CO2 concentrations over time or a table of temperature anomalies, and discuss what they show. Integrate a brief methodology note (“This dataset is derived from…”). Strengthen synthesis by showing how multiple lines of evidence converge.\\n\\nFormatting Guidance\\n- If this is a school essay:\\n  - Use standard formatting (12 pt Times New Roman, double-spaced, 1-inch margins).\\n  - Include a clear title and your name/date/class if required.\\n  - Follow MLA or APA for in-text citations and a Works Cited/References page.\\n  - Paragraph length: aim for 6–10 well-developed sentences per paragraph.\\n- Citation examples:\\n  - MLA: (IPCC 23)\\n  - APA: (IPCC, 2023)\\n- If images/charts are allowed, label them, cite sources, and reference them in the text (“As shown in Figure 1…”).\\n\\nSample line-by-line edit of your provided sentence\\n- Original: The argument say climate change is real but I don’t provide any data and the paragraphs is choppy.\\n- Edited: The argument says climate change is real, but I don’t provide any data, and the paragraphs are choppy.\\n  - Reasoning:\\n    - “say” → “says” for subject-verb agreement.\\n    - Commas improve readability in a compound sentence.\\n    - “paragraphs is” → “paragraphs are” for plural subject agreement.\\n    - Balanced parallel structure across clauses.\\n\\nWould you like me to:\\n- Review your full draft with line-by-line edits?\\n- Create an outline and a thesis statement tailored to your assignment?\\n- Rewrite your essay to incorporate evidence, examples, transitions, and a professional tone?\\n\\nIf you paste the text or share the document, I’ll provide detailed, itemized edits and a polished version.\",\n    \"metrics\": {\n      \"groundtruth-eval with azure:o4-mini_2025-04-16\": {\n        \"content\": \"{\\\"explanation\\\":\\\"Missing exact “Overview” section; mis‐classified spelling edits; no direct question on writing goals.\\\",\\\"score\\\":0}\",\n        \"score\": 0\n      }\n    },\n    \"compliance\": \"ok\",\n    \"complianceText\": \"Aligned with description: asks clarifying questions, gives overview, structured categorized feedback, line-by-line edits, offers next steps.  \\nOK\",\n    \"isGroundtruth\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"747691a\",\n    \"promptid\": \"b7651b1\",\n    \"ruleid\": null,\n    \"testuid\": \"baseline-test-hlyqdp9hk\",\n    \"scenario\": \"\",\n    \"baseline\": true,\n    \"testinput\": \"goals: I'm just getting started—what can you do for my writing, and how do your edits work?\\ntype_of_writing: general inquiry\\ntarget_audience: me\\nfeedback_focus: Please briefly explain your purpose and give short examples for how you'd help with an essay and an email.\\ntone_preferences: concise, friendly\\nconstraints: keep it brief; I don't have a draft yet\\nadditional_notes: I will paste text later\",\n    \"model\": \"gpt-5-2025-08-07\",\n    \"input\": \"goals: I'm just getting started—what can you do for my writing, and how do your edits work?\\ntype_of_writing: general inquiry\\ntarget_audience: me\\nfeedback_focus: Please briefly explain your purpose and give short examples for how you'd help with an essay and an email.\\ntone_preferences: concise, friendly\\nconstraints: keep it brief; I don't have a draft yet\\nadditional_notes: I will paste text later\",\n    \"output\": \"Here’s how I can help, briefly:\\n\\nPurpose\\n- I edit and improve your writing with line-by-line suggestions on clarity, grammar, style, structure, and formatting—always with short explanations for each change.\\n\\nHow my edits work\\n- You share your draft (paste text or upload).

I can help strengthen your thesis, improve flow, and fix grammar/tense issues while keeping your voice and MLA expectations in mind.\\n\\nBefore I begin, a couple of quick clarifying questions:\\n- Are you okay with removing phrases like “I think” to make the thesis more assertive, or do you prefer to keep first-person throughout?\\n- Would you like to avoid contractions (e.g., “don’t” → “do not”) for a more formal tone?\\n- Is “Turkle” referring to Sherry Turkle? If so, I’ll keep the in-text citation as-is and include a Works Cited placeholder.\\n\\nOverview of the editorial approach:\\n- Strengthen the thesis into a clear, concise claim early in the paragraph.\\n- Smooth transitions and tighten sentences for better flow.\\n- Correct grammar (subject-verb agreement, pronouns, punctuation) and maintain consistent present tense where appropriate.\\n- Align with MLA style: in-text citation placement, formal tone suggestions, and a Works Cited placeholder.\\n\\nLine-by-line edits with reasoning:\\n1) Original: “In todays world, social media are making people more connected but also more apart.”\\n   Suggested: “In today’s world, social media is making people more connected but also more isolated.”\\n   Reasoning:\\n   - “todays” needs an apostrophe: “today’s.”\\n   - “social media” is usually treated as a singular mass noun: use “is,” not “are.”\\n   - “more apart” is awkward; “more isolated” is clearer and more academic.\\n\\n2) Original: “I think that while it helps us communicate, it also make us lonely, because we are scrolling instead of seeing each other.”\\n   Suggested: “While it helps us communicate, it also makes us lonely because we scroll instead of seeing each other.”\\n   Reasoning:\\n   - Remove “I think that” to strengthen the claim (thesis becomes more assertive).\\n   - Subject-verb agreement: “makes,” not “make.”\\n   - General statements in academic writing usually use simple present (“we scroll”), not present progressive (“we are scrolling”).\\n   - The comma before “because” is unnecessary; removing it tightens the sentence.\\n\\n3) Original: “For example, I text my friends daily but I dont see them on weekend, which used to be normal before.”\\n   Suggested: “For example, I text my friends daily, but I do not see them on weekends, even though hanging out used to be normal.”\\n   Reasoning:\\n   - Add comma before “but” to separate independent clauses.\\n   - “dont” needs an apostrophe: “do not” (or “don’t,” but “do not” is more formal).\\n   - “weekend” should be plural (“weekends”) to match the general habit.\\n   - “which used to be normal before” is redundant and awkward; “used to be normal” is sufficient. “Hanging out” clarifies what was normal.\\n\\n4) Original: “This topic is very important because people are getting worse attention span and that affects school.”\\n   Suggested: “This topic is important because people’s attention spans are getting worse, and that affects their performance in school.”\\n   Reasoning:\\n   - “attention span” should be plural (“attention spans”) or rephrased.\\n   - “people are getting worse attention span” is awkward; rephrase for clarity.\\n   - Specify “their performance in school” to make the impact clearer and more academic.\\n   - Consider dropping “very” for a more formal tone.\\n\\n5) Original: “Some people says social media is just a tool and it depends how you use it, but I think the whole design is addictive. (Turkle 45)”\\n   Suggested: “Some people say social media is just a tool and that it depends on how people use it, but its design is addictive (Turkle 45).”\\n   Reasoning:\\n   - Subject-verb agreement: “say,” not “says.”\\n   - Add “that” for parallel structure and clarity.\\n   - Avoid second-person “you” in academic writing; use “people.”\\n   - In MLA, place the period after the parenthetical citation: “…addictive (Turkle 45).”\\n\\nOverall Feedback:\\n- Your central idea is strong: social media both connects and isolates us. Tightening the thesis and removing hedging (“I think”) will make your argument more persuasive.\\n- The flow improves when you use consistent present tense, avoid second-person “you,” and connect examples directly to your claim.\\n- Word choice like “isolated,” “performance,” and “addictive design” strengthens academic tone without losing your voice.\\n\\nSpelling Edits:\\n- “todays” → “today’s” (apostrophe shows possession).\\n- “dont” → “do not” (or “don’t” if you prefer; “do not” is more formal).\\n\\nGrammar Edits:\\n- Treat “social media” as singular: “social media is,” not “are.”\\n- Subject-verb agreement: “makes,” not “make.”\\n- Pluralize general habits: “on weekends,” not “on weekend.”\\n- Comma usage: Add comma before “but” when joining independent clauses; remove comma before “because” unless needed for clarity.\\n- Pronoun consistency: Avoid second-person “you” in academic writing; use “people” or “we.”\\n- Place MLA citation before the period: “…addictive (Turkle 45).”\\n\\nStructural Suggestions:\\n- Put a clear thesis early, ideally as the first or second sentence. For example: “Although social media helps us communicate, its addictive design makes us lonelier and weakens our attention, which harms our real-world relationships and school performance.”\\n- Keep one example per paragraph and tie it back to the thesis explicitly (e.g., explain how weekend habits reflect isolation and attention issues).\\n- Consider ending the paragraph with a sentence that previews the next point or reinforces your claim (a mini-conclusion).\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement:\\n- Add a brief transition from your example back to the broader impact (e.g., “This pattern shows how digital connection can replace in-person time.”).\\n- If you’ll include more evidence later, think about varying examples (school focus, relationships, mental health) while staying within your assignment’s scope.\\n- Consider a signal phrase for the source: “As Turkle argues, social media’s design encourages addictive behavior (45).” This integrates the citation smoothly.\\n\\nFormatting Guidance (MLA):\\n- In-text citations: Place the parenthetical citation before the period: “…addictive (Turkle 45).”\\n- Maintain double-spacing, 1-inch margins, Times New Roman 12 pt, and a running header with your last name and page number.\\n- First page header: Your Name, Teacher’s Name, Course, Date (Day Month Year), then centered essay title, then your text.\\n- Works Cited: Include a placeholder entry for Turkle.

Before I dive in, two quick questions so I can tailor the edits:\\n- Do you want the piece to read in past tense or present tense? Because you mention “last night,” past tense is the most consistent choice; I can also adjust the time marker if you prefer present tense immediacy.\\n- Any word count or submission requirements from the magazine (font, margins, etc.), beyond standard manuscript format?\\n\\nOverview of what I’ll do:\\n- Make all verbs consistent in one tense (recommend past tense to match “last night”).\\n- Tighten descriptions for clarity while preserving your imagery and tone.\\n- Correct dialogue punctuation and adjust sentence boundaries for rhythm and pacing.\\n- Offer show-vs.-tell upgrades through small sensory details and interior beats.\\n- Provide structural and formatting guidance for a clean submission.\\n\\nOverall Feedback\\n- Your opening immediately establishes mood with “buzzing like a hive” and the quirky, secret-knowing whale—great voice. The main issues are tense shifts (present to past and back), a few unclear or repetitive verbs, and one long sentence that would land better if split. With consistent tense and a few rhythm tweaks, the scene will feel polished and vivid.\\n\\nSpelling Edits\\n- No spelling errors detected.\\n- Small word choice polish recommended:\\n  - “empty place” → “empty arcade” for specificity and clarity.\\n\\nGrammar Edits (line-by-line with proposed revisions and reasoning)\\n- Original: “I walk into the old arcade last night and the lights were buzzing like a hive.”\\n  - Proposed: “I walked into the old arcade last night, and the lights buzzed like a hive.”\\n  - Why: Aligns tense with “last night” (walk → walked; were buzzing → buzzed), improves flow with a comma to join independent clauses, and pares “were buzzing” to “buzzed” for tighter prose.\\n\\n- Original: “The air smells of dust and coins.”\\n  - Proposed: “The air smelled of dust and coins.”\\n  - Why: Past tense consistency (smells → smelled). “Of” is fine; the phrase is concise and evocative.\\n\\n- Original: “You coming?” Jay says, but I was already at the claw machine, staring at a plush whale that looks at me like it knows a secret.\\n  - Proposed Option A (clean and concise): “You coming?” Jay said, but I was already at the claw machine, staring at a plush whale that looked at me like it knew a secret.\\n  - Proposed Option B (stronger pacing): “You coming?” Jay said. I was already at the claw machine, staring at a plush whale that looked at me like it knew a secret.\\n  - Why: Past tense consistency (says → said; looks → looked; knows → knew). Option B splits the long sentence, creating a clearer beat that shows your focus shifting from Jay to the whale.\\n\\n- Original: “I drop the token. It clatters.”\\n  - Proposed: “I dropped the token. It clattered.”\\n  - Why: Past tense consistency (drop → dropped; clatters → clattered). The short, paired sentences keep a nice staccato rhythm.\\n\\n- Original: “I am thinking this is silly and then the claw was moving and my heart thumped.”\\n  - Proposed Option A: “I thought it was silly, and then the claw moved and my heart thumped.”\\n  - Proposed Option B (smoother cause-effect): “I thought it was silly until the claw moved and my heart thumped.”\\n  - Why: Past tense consistency (am thinking → thought; was moving → moved). Option B tightens the causal turn—your feeling changes when the claw moves.\\n\\n- Original: “The whale slips, then it slip again and I laugh, but it sounded too loud in the empty place.”\\n  - Proposed Option A: “The whale slipped, then slipped again, and I laughed, but the sound was too loud in the empty arcade.”\\n  - Proposed Option B (pacing with emphasis): “The whale slipped—then slipped again—and I laughed, but the sound was too loud in the empty arcade.”\\n  - Why: Past tense consistency (slips/slip → slipped), parallel structure for “slipped,” and clarity (“empty place” → “empty arcade”). Option B uses em dashes to mimic the stuttering motion of the claw for vivid pacing.\\n\\nStructural Suggestions\\n- Consider splitting the sentence with Jay’s dialogue from your action (Option B above) to emphasize your pull toward the whale and create a cleaner transition.\\n- Use a brief interior beat after “It clattered” to show your anticipation or self-consciousness (e.g., “I pretended not to care, but my fingers hovered near the joystick”). This adds texture without changing plot beats.\\n- The final sentence is carrying several actions; using em dashes or a period can distribute emphasis and make the scene feel more dynamic.\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement (show vs. tell and pacing)\\n- Show the arcade’s emptiness with a sensory detail: the soundtrack loop barely audible, a sticky spot under your shoe, or the flicker of a half-dead neon letter. This replaces “empty place” with concrete atmosphere.\\n- Give us a reflective beat that matches the whimsical tone when you see the whale: one line of internal narration connects your fascination to why it “knows a secret,” e.g., “It had the sleepy smile of someone who’s already won.”\\n- Vary sentence lengths: keep your short, punchy lines (“It clattered.”), but let one or two longer sentences carry mood. You already do this—just tighten the long ones to avoid run-ons.\\n\\nFormatting Guidance (standard manuscript)\\n- Use 12-point Times New Roman, double-spaced, 1-inch margins, left-aligned, and indent the first line of each paragraph by 0.5 inches.\\n- Include a header with your last name, story title (shortened if needed), and page number on each page (top right).\\n- Dialogue punctuation:\\n  - Keep punctuation inside the quotation marks: “You coming?”\\n  - Use a lower-case dialogue tag if it continues the sentence: “You coming?” Jay said.\\n  - Consider a period and new sentence when shifting focus: “You coming?” Jay said. I was already…\\n\\nWould you like me to generate a fully revised version in past tense (or present, if you prefer), incorporating all the suggested changes and pacing tweaks? I can also add one or two subtle sensory details to deepen the mood while preserving your voice.\\n\\nAnything else you want me to prioritize—word count, submission guidelines, or specific magazine preferences?\",\n    \"metrics\": {\n      \"groundtruth-eval with azure:o4-mini_2025-04-16\": {\n        \"content\": \"{\\\"explanation\\\":\\\"Nonexact headings used\\\",\\\"score\\\":85}\",\n        \"score\": 85\n      }\n    },\n    \"compliance\": \"ok\",\n    \"complianceText\": \"Fits the description’s structure and tone: asks clarifying questions, gives overview, and categorized, line-by-line feedback with reasoning.  \\nOK\",\n    \"isGroundtruth\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"2cbd2d0\",\n    \"promptid\": \"b7651b1\",\n    \"ruleid\": null,\n    \"testuid\": \"baseline-test-0uf79y3zi\",\n    \"scenario\": \"\",\n    \"baseline\": true,\n    \"testinput\": \"goals: Make the tone professional, fix grammar and concision, and improve structure\\ntype_of_writing: complaint email to customer support\\ntarget_audience: electronics retailer customer service\\nfeedback_focus: line-by-line grammar/spelling edits with reasoning; structural suggestions; formatting for a clear, polite email\\nformatting: email format (subject line, greeting, body, call to action, signature)\\ntone_preferences: polite but firm\\nconstraints: keep order number and dates; no exaggerations; keep under 250 words\\ntext: Subject: Issue with damaged monitor order\\nTo whom it may concern,\\nI am writing about my order #A11359 placed on Aug 29.

“backroom” can imply behind-the-scenes dealings)\\n- rewards card → rewards program (if your store uses “rewards card,” keep that term; otherwise “program” reads broadly and professionally)\\n\\nGrammar edits\\n- Use parallel, action-led phrasing across bullets (each begins with a verb).\\n- Maintain present tense for current role: Assist, Close, Train, Increase, Organize.\\n- Avoid filler words and parentheses; integrate “ongoing” by using present tense rather than “(ongoing).”\\n- Capitalization: Start each bullet with a capital letter; use sentence case, not Title Case, within bullets.\\n\\nStructural suggestions (ordering for maximum impact)\\n- Lead with results and leadership, then customer service, then operational reliability:\\n  1) Increase sales by promoting the store rewards program to customers\\n  2) Train new hires on stocking procedures and safety;

If there’s more, please paste it so I can edit the whole piece line by line.\\n- Do you have a specific prompt or theme you’re responding to?\\n- Are there particular outcomes you want to highlight (for example, how the website affected the business, any community responses, or how this experience connects to your interests in college)?\\n\\nOverview of how I’ll help:\\n- Sharpen clarity and tone without losing authenticity.\\n- Strengthen the arc from early responsibility to concrete action to reflection and future goals.\\n- Suggest precise word choices and small grammar fixes for polish.\\n- Recommend structural additions (brief scenes, concrete outcomes, and a tight closing) to reach 600–650 words.\\n\\nOverall Feedback:\\n- Strengths: The opening image (translating bank forms), the concrete action during the pandemic, and the reflection on community are compelling and genuine. Your voice feels grounded and humble.\\n- Opportunities: Add one or two vivid micro-scenes (e.g., a moment in the bank office or delivering a flyer) and a specific outcome (e.g., increased orders, messages from customers). Clarify the connection to college by naming the broader skills or areas you hope to develop (e.g., navigating systems, communications, community organizing, business/tech tools).\\n- Arc: You already have a clear arc—responsibility → action → learning → purpose. Strengthen it with concrete details and a tighter final sentence that shows how you’ll build on this in college.\\n\\nLine-by-line edits with reasoning:\\n1) “Growing up as a first-generation Mexican American, I often translated bank forms for my parents and tried to make sense of bills with unfamiliar words.”\\n- Suggested edit: “…and tried to make sense of bills full of unfamiliar terms.”\\n- Reason: “terms” is more precise in formal contexts; keeps your tone intact.\\n\\n2) “At first, I felt small in those offices, like I was pretending to be older.”\\n- Suggested edit: “…as if I were pretending to be older.”\\n- Reason: “as if I were” is more formal and grammatically standard in reflective prose; it preserves your meaning.\\n\\n3) “Over time, I realized I was learning a language of responsibility.”\\n- Suggested edit: “…the language of responsibility.”\\n- Reason: “the language” gives the metaphor more weight and specificity.\\n\\n4) “When my mom’s small catering business almost closed during the pandemic, I made flyers, wrote emails, and built a simple website on my cracked phone.”\\n- Suggested edits:\\n  - “…was on the brink of closing…” (instead of “almost closed”)\\n  - “…and built a simple website using my cracked phone.”\\n- Reason: “on the brink of closing” is idiomatic and vivid; “using” is the accurate preposition for tools.\\n\\n5) “It wasn’t perfect, but it worked, and we kept going.”\\n- Suggested edit: “It wasn’t perfect, but it worked. We kept going.”\\n- Reason: Splitting the sentence improves rhythm and avoids a pile-up of commas; the short second sentence adds emphasis.\\n\\n6) “This taught me how community isn’t a slogan; it’s people showing up for each other.”\\n- Suggested edit: “This taught me that community isn’t a slogan; it’s people showing up for each other.”\\n- Reason: “that” is the correct conjunction for a statement of realization.\\n\\n7) “I still worry about sounding ‘right,’ but I’ve learned to ask questions and keep trying even when I’m unsure.”\\n- Optional tweak: “I still worry about sounding ‘right,’ but I’ve learned to ask questions and keep trying, even when I’m unsure.”\\n- Reason: A comma before the final clause smooths pacing; keeping the quotes preserves your voice.\\n\\n8) “College, to me, is a place to grow that force of trying into something that can help others, especially families navigating systems that pretend to be simple.”\\n- Suggested edit: “To me, college is a place to turn that persistence into work that helps others—especially families navigating systems that seem simple on the surface.”\\n- Reason: “turn that persistence into work” tightens the abstract phrase; “seem simple on the surface” softens the tone slightly while preserving your point.\\n\\nSpelling Edits:\\n- “first-generation” is correctly hyphenated.\\n- “Mexican American” is correct; no hyphen needed in this usage.\\n- “flyers” is fine (U.S. usage). “fliers” is also acceptable; choose one and use it consistently.\\n\\nGrammar Edits:\\n- Prefer “as if I were” to “like I was” for formal tone.\\n- Use “that” after “taught me” for correct syntax.\\n- Consider splitting longer compound sentences (as in “It wasn’t perfect, but it worked. We kept going.”).\\n- Replace “on my cracked phone” with “using my cracked phone” for idiomatic clarity.\\n\\nStructural Suggestions (to reach ~600–650 words):\\n- Paragraph 1 (hook + context): Keep your opening but add a micro-scene (e.g., a moment in the bank office with a specific phrase you translated and how it made you feel). 120–150 words.\\n- Paragraph 2 (challenge + actions): Expand the pandemic period. Describe your strategy briefly (creating flyers, writing emails, what you put on the website), and include one concrete outcome (e.g., number of new orders, partnerships, a thank-you message). 200–250 words.\\n- Paragraph 3 (reflection): Tie your actions to a broader lesson—learning to ask questions, demystifying systems, building trust. 120–150 words.\\n- Paragraph 4 (forward-looking close): Connect the skills and mindset to what you hope to develop in college (e.g., tools for small businesses or families, communication, data, policy, tech). End with a concise return to your opening metaphor (“the language of responsibility” and community). 120–150 words.\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement:\\n- Add one brief, concrete detail about the website (e.g., menu photos, order form, testimonials) and how you spread the word (texts, local Facebook groups, church bulletin).\\n- Include a measurable or observable result to show impact.\\n- Show a moment of uncertainty and how you resolved it (e.g., teaching yourself a website builder, asking a librarian for help).\\n- Name transferable skills: translating complex information, perseverance, community-building, communication.\\n- Clarify your future direction (fields or skills you want to build) without locking into a major: this helps admissions readers see growth potential.\\n\\nFormatting Guidance (650-word limit, admissions conventions):\\n- Aim for 3–5 short paragraphs with clear transitions.\\n- Vary sentence lengths; avoid long strings of clauses.\\n- Standard punctuation is best; an em dash or semicolon is fine sparingly.\\n- Keep language clean and direct; avoid jargon.\\n- Stay under 650 words; 600–640 reads well and leaves room for final polishing.\\n\\nWould you like me to:\\n- Edit the full ~590-word draft line by line?\\n- Or expand this excerpt into a polished 600–650-word essay that incorporates these suggestions while keeping your voice?\\n\\nIf you want, I can also generate a revised version of this paragraph now, incorporating the specific edits above.\",\n    \"metrics\": {\n      \"groundtruth-eval with azure:o4-mini_2025-04-16\": {\n        \"content\": \"{\\\"explanation\\\":\\\"Missing exact “Overview” heading.\\\",\\\"score\\\":90}\",\n        \"score\": 90\n      }\n    },\n    \"compliance\": \"ok\",\n    \"complianceText\": \"Everything aligns well with the described editorial framework: it asks clarifying questions, gives an overview, organizes feedback into the required categories, explains each suggestion, maintains a constructive tone, and offers next steps.  \\nOK\",\n    \"isGroundtruth\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"20e21ec\",\n    \"promptid\": \"b7651b1\",\n    \"ruleid\": null,\n    \"testuid\": \"baseline-test-979705jj1\",\n    \"scenario\": \"\",\n    \"baseline\": true,\n    \"testinput\": \"goals: Improve word choice, check capitalization and punctuation; preserve line breaks and imagery\\ntype_of_writing: poem (free verse)\\ntarget_audience: school literary journal\\nfeedback_focus: line-by-line edits with reasoning; subtle style suggestions; formatting guidance for line breaks/stanzas\\nformatting: poetry conventions (intentional capitalization choices, em-dashes)\\ntone_preferences: lyrical, contemplative\\nconstraints: maintain metaphors and core images; do not impose rhyme\\ntext: the sun dropps behind the hill—\\ni chase the day like a late bus,\\nshoes unlaced, the gravel keeps my secrets.\\nI call the trees my witnesses\\nand they don’t answer (they never did)\\nbut the leaves clap anyway, a small stadium.\\ntomorrow is a folded map in my pocket\\nthat I forgot to unfold.\",\n    \"model\": \"gpt-5-2025-08-07\",\n    \"input\": \"goals: Improve word choice, check capitalization and punctuation; preserve line breaks and imagery\\ntype_of_writing: poem (free verse)\\ntarget_audience: school literary journal\\nfeedback_focus: line-by-line edits with reasoning; subtle style suggestions; formatting guidance for line breaks/stanzas\\nformatting: poetry conventions (intentional capitalization choices, em-dashes)\\ntone_preferences: lyrical, contemplative\\nconstraints: maintain metaphors and core images; do not impose rhyme\\ntext: the sun dropps behind the hill—\\ni chase the day like a late bus,\\nshoes unlaced, the gravel keeps my secrets.\\nI call the trees my witnesses\\nand they don’t answer (they never did)\\nbut the leaves clap anyway, a small stadium.\\ntomorrow is a folded map in my pocket\\nthat I forgot to unfold.\",\n    \"output\": \"Thanks for sharing your poem. I’ll focus on improving word choice, capitalization, punctuation, and tense consistency while preserving your line breaks, imagery, and free-verse feel. Before I propose a final edited version, a couple of quick questions to make sure my edits match your intent:\\n- Do you want a consistent lowercase style (including “i”), or standard capitalization throughout? Your current poem mixes both.\\n- Are you open to small tense tweaks to keep the poem present-focused?\\n- Do you prefer parentheses for asides, or would you like to use em dashes for a more seamless, lyrical flow?\\n\\nOverview of the editorial approach\\n- Correct the single spelling error.\\n- Smooth tense consistency so the poem stays present-focused.\\n- Suggest a consistent capitalization approach (either all-lowercase for a lyrical, contemplative tone or standard capitalization for a more formal journal style).\\n- Offer subtle punctuation adjustments (em dashes vs commas/parentheses) to enhance cadence.\\n- Provide optional word-choice refinements that keep your metaphors intact.\\n- Offer an optional stanza break to heighten the emotional turn.\\n\\nLine-by-line edits with reasoning\\n- Line 1: “the sun dropps behind the hill—”\\n  - Change “dropps” to “drops” (spelling).\\n  - Keep the em dash; it works well as a lingering pause and sets the contemplative tone.\\n  - Capitalization choice: if you go all-lowercase, this line is already aligned.\\n\\n- Line 2: “i chase the day like a late bus,”\\n  - This line reads well. The simile is vivid and contemporary.\\n  - Capitalization choice: keep “i” lowercase if you choose the all-lowercase style; otherwise change to “I.”\\n\\n- Line 3: “shoes unlaced, the gravel keeps my secrets.”\\n  - The comma works, but consider an em dash for a more lyrical hinge: “shoes unlaced—the gravel keeps my secrets.”\\n  - Reason: the dash strengthens the connection and adds a musical pause. The phrase “keeps my secrets” is strong; if you want a tactile nuance, “holds” is an option, but “keeps” maintains the confidentiality image.\\n\\n- Line 4: “I call the trees my witnesses”\\n  - For capitalization consistency, use either “i” (if all-lowercase) or keep “I” and adjust earlier lines to standard case.\\n  - Optional word choice: “name the trees my witnesses” is slightly more formal/ceremonial; “call” is more conversational. Choose based on the tone you want.\\n\\n- Line 5: “and they don’t answer (they never did)”\\n  - Tense consistency: change “did” to “do” to keep the poem in the present: “and they don’t answer (they never do).”\\n  - If you prefer a seamless flow, consider an em dash instead of parentheses: “and they don’t answer— they never do.” Parentheses feel more self-aware; em dashes feel more embedded in the voice.\\n\\n- Line 6: “but the leaves clap anyway, a small stadium.”\\n  - Consider an em dash to clarify the apposition: “but the leaves clap anyway—a small stadium.”\\n  - Reason: the dash emphasizes “a small stadium” as a metaphorical rename rather than a loose addition. If you prefer a simile, “like a small stadium” is also clear, but the metaphor is stronger as-is.\\n\\n- Line 7: “tomorrow is a folded map in my pocket”\\n  - Strong image; reads clearly. No changes needed.\\n  - If you adopt standard capitalization, capitalize “Tomorrow.”\\n\\n- Line 8: “that I forgot to unfold.”\\n  - Tense consistency: shift to present perfect for cohesion with the rest of the poem: “that I haven’t yet unfolded.”\\n  - If you prefer a more direct phrasing, you can end the poem with an em dash for a quiet, suspended feeling:\\n    - “that I haven’t yet unfolded—”\\n    - Or add the pronoun for clarity: “that I haven’t yet unfolded it.” (This slightly reduces the elegance; the noun “map” already carries the action.)\\n\\nOverall Feedback\\n- Strengths: Your imagery is vivid and coherent—the late bus, witnesses of trees, stadium of leaves, and the folded map work together as a persuasive meditation on urgency and intention. Sound devices like “shoes,” “secrets,” and “stadium” give the poem soft consonance. The em dash in line 1 sets a reflective pace that suits the lyrical tone.\\n- Main improvements: Correct the spelling error, unify capitalization, and maintain present-tense consistency. A few punctuation adjustments can heighten the rhythm and clarity without changing your metaphors.\\n\\nSpelling Edits\\n- “dropps” → “drops”\\n  - Reason: Standard spelling.\\n\\nGrammar Edits\\n- Tense consistency:\\n  - “(they never did)” → “(they never do)” to keep present tense across the poem.\\n  - “that I forgot to unfold” → “that I haven’t yet unfolded” to align with present-focused narration.\\n- Capitalization consistency:\\n  - Choose one of the following:\\n    - All-lowercase style for a contemplative, modern feel: “i” throughout; keep line-initial words lowercase.\\n    - Standard capitalization for literary journal formality: Capitalize “The,” “I,” “Tomorrow,” and sentence beginnings.\\n\\nStructural Suggestions\\n- Consider a stanza break after line 6 to separate the external scene (chasing day, trees, leaves) from the inward turn (tomorrow as a map). For example:\\n  - Stanza 1: lines 1–6\\n  - Stanza 2: lines 7–8\\n  - Reason: It creates a clean pivot from witness/response to intention/future.\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement\\n- Punctuation cadence:\\n  - Line 3: Em dash instead of comma can strengthen the hinge between action and secrecy.\\n  - Line 6: Em dash before “a small stadium” clarifies apposition and heightens the image.\\n- Optional word-choice refinements (only if desired):\\n  - “call” → “name” for a ceremonial tone.\\n  - “keeps” → “holds” for tactile resonance. These are stylistic, not necessary.\\n\\nFormatting Guidance\\n- Em dashes: Use a true em dash (—) with no surrounding spaces for a clean, contemporary look, as you’ve done in line 1. If you add more dashes, keep that convention consistent.\\n- Parenthetical aside vs em dash: Parentheses create a thoughtful whisper; em dashes integrate the aside into the line’s flow. Either is acceptable—choose one style and apply it consistently.\\n- Capitalization:\\n  - All-lowercase is an accepted poetry convention and suits a contemplative tone; ensure “i” is consistently lowercase if you choose this.\\n  - If the journal favors standard capitalization, use sentence case for lines that form complete sentences.\\n- Line breaks: Your current breaks work well and should be preserved. If you add a stanza break after line 6, insert one blank line between stanzas.\\n\\nWould you like me to generate the edited poem? I can provide:\\n- Version A: all-lowercase with em dashes (contemplative style).\\n- Version B: standard capitalization with either em dashes or parentheses (more formal journal style).\\n\\nIf you have a preference on parentheses vs em dashes and capitalization style, tell me which you’d like, and I’ll produce the polished version accordingly.\",\n    \"metrics\": {\n      \"groundtruth-eval with azure:o4-mini_2025-04-16\": {\n        \"content\": \"{\\\"score\\\":95,\\\"explanation\\\":\\\"Missing exact “Overview” heading.\\\"}\",\n        \"score\": 95\n      }\n    },\n    \"compliance\": \"ok\",\n    \"complianceText\": \"Aligned with described editing process: overview, line-by-line edits, categories, clarifying questions, offer to rewrite.\\nOK\",\n    \"isGroundtruth\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"771c6cf\",\n    \"promptid\": \"b7651b1\",\n    \"ruleid\": null,\n    \"testuid\": \"baseline-test-dpyx4vb7j\",\n    \"scenario\": \"\",\n    \"baseline\": true,\n    \"testinput\": \"goals: Clarify thesis and evaluation criteria; fix grammar and tone; suggest structure\\ntype_of_writing: book review\\ntarget_audience: classmates and teacher\\nfeedback_focus: line-by-line edits with reasoning; structural suggestions (intro-summary-analysis-conclusion); formatting guidance\\nformatting: MLA for book titles and quotes\\ntone_preferences: analytical yet accessible\\nconstraints: include at least one quote; avoid spoilers beyond mid-point\\ntext: In The Giver by Lois Lowry, the community seems perfect but actually its not.

Evaluating the book’s symbolism, pacing, and thematic depth, I argue that Lowry’s use of color powerfully represents freedom and choice, the mid-book pacing reduces urgency, and the ending—though ambiguous—invites thoughtful discussion.\\n\\nSummary (early plot only):\\nJonas lives in an orderly society designed to eliminate conflict and difference. Early in the novel, he notices an apple “change,” a moment that foreshadows his changing perception of the world and hints that not everything in his community is what it seems.\\n\\nAnalysis:\\nColor functions as a symbol of individuality and possibility, contrasting with the community’s uniform uniformity. As Jonas’s perceptions broaden, Lowry suggests that true choice requires the ability to perceive differences, linking the novel’s exploration of memory to moral responsibility. While the middle sections slow, the measured pacing mirrors the community’s controlled routine and emphasizes how difficult it is to disrupt a system built on predictability.\\n\\nConclusion:\\nAlthough the ending resists a tidy resolution, its openness is effective because it pushes readers to consider what safety costs and who pays that price. Overall, I recommend The Giver because it prompts reflection on choices, memory, and the price of safety.\\n\\nWould you like me to:\\n- Expand the analysis with one more early-text quote?\\n- Add MLA in-text citations with page numbers from your edition?\\n- Format a complete Works Cited section based on your edition details?\",\n    \"metrics\": {\n      \"groundtruth-eval with azure:o4-mini_2025-04-16\": {\n        \"content\": \"{\\\"score\\\":80,\\\"explanation\\\":\\\"Missing Overall Feedback section\\\"}\",\n        \"score\": 80\n      }\n    },\n    \"compliance\": \"ok\",\n    \"complianceText\": \"Structured feedback aligns with required categories, reasoning, tone, and step-by-step instructions.  \\nOK\",\n    \"isGroundtruth\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"3825c80\",\n    \"promptid\": \"b7651b1\",\n    \"ruleid\": null,\n    \"testuid\": \"baseline-test-0ufvxdvuo\",\n    \"scenario\": \"\",\n    \"baseline\": true,\n    \"testinput\": \"goals: Improve clarity, consistency, and citation formatting; ensure a coherent argument\\ntype_of_writing: history research paper excerpt\\ntarget_audience: AP U.S. History teacher\\nfeedback_focus: line-by-line grammar and style edits with reasoning; structural suggestions; formatting and citation guidance\\nformatting: Chicago Notes-Bibliography (footnotes), page numbers, proper quotation format\\ntone_preferences: formal, objective\\nconstraints: keep footnote markers [1], [2] as placeholders; do not add sources\\ntext: The New Deal did not end the Great Depression; however, it redefined the relationship between citizens and the federal government.

This also strengthens the causal/contrast relationship.\\n\\n2) Original: “Relief agencies were criticized as being both too much and not enough.”\\n   - Edit: “Relief agencies faced criticism for being simultaneously excessive and insufficient.”\\n   - Reason: Removes the wordy “as being,” replaces colloquial phrasing (“too much and not enough”) with concise formal language, and keeps past tense.\\n\\n3) Original: “For example, the CCC created jobs for young men but also reinforced certain gender norms.[1]”\\n   - Edit: “For example, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) created jobs for young men but reinforced prevailing gender norms.[1]”\\n   - Reason: On first mention, spell out the acronym for clarity; “prevailing” is more precise than “certain”; deleting “also” tightens the sentence without changing meaning.\\n\\n4) Original: “In addition, some programs excluded domestic workers, which disproportionately impacted Black women.[2]”\\n   - Edit: “Additionally, some programs excluded domestic workers, a policy that disproportionately affected Black women.[2]”\\n   - Reason: “Additionally” is slightly tighter than “In addition,” “affected” is more formal than “impacted,” and changing the relative clause (“which”) to “a policy that” clarifies the referent (the exclusion itself) and improves flow.\\n\\n5) Original: “While the scope of reform was unprecedented, the policies had limits that shows the contradictions of the era.”\\n   - Edit: “While the scope of reform was unprecedented, these policies had limits that revealed the era’s contradictions.”\\n   - Reason: Fixes subject–verb agreement (“policies … revealed,” not “shows”), maintains past tense, and strengthens the verb (“revealed” instead of “showed”) for analytical tone.\\n\\nStructural Suggestions\\n- Keep the current sequence (thesis → general criticism → example 1 → example 2 → synthesis), but:\\n  - Strengthen the final sentence to explicitly connect the examples to the thesis (how they demonstrate the redefinition’s limits).\\n  - Consider a brief bridge phrase at the start of the concluding sentence (e.g., “Taken together,” or “These mixed outcomes”) to make the synthesis explicit.\\n- If this is an intro to a section, you might add one clause that signals what kinds of “limits” you will discuss (gender, labor exclusions) to forecast the argument.\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement\\n- Clarify terms and context:\\n  - If space allows, identify which programs excluded domestic workers (e.g., initial Social Security provisions) without adding citations beyond those you already plan to include, to increase precision.\\n  - If CCC has been introduced earlier, you can keep “CCC”; otherwise, expand on first mention as suggested.\\n- Consider a slightly more explicit link from the examples to the thesis:\\n  - Example: “These policies expanded federal presence while preserving existing social hierarchies, underscoring the contradictions of New Deal reform.”\\n\\nFormatting Guidance (Chicago Notes-Bibliography)\\n- Footnote markers: Keep [1], [2] in your draft for now. When you finalize:\\n  - Convert to superscript numerals.\\n  - Place note numbers after punctuation (e.g., after the period or comma) and after any closing quotation marks.\\n- Footnote entries (in the notes section at the bottom of the page):\\n  - Use full notes for first citations; abbreviated notes thereafter.\\n  - Single-space footnotes with a blank line between notes; indent the first line of each note.\\n- Page formatting:\\n  - 1-inch margins, 12-point Times New Roman, double-spaced text, first-line paragraph indent.\\n  - Page numbers in the header, upper-right.\\n  - Include a separate title page (centered title, your name, course, instructor, date) if your teacher requires it.\\n- Quotation formatting:\\n  - Use double quotation marks for quotations; single quotation marks for quotes within quotes.\\n  - Block quotations (five or more lines or roughly 100+ words): indent, no quotation marks, footnote number placed after the final punctuation of the block.\\n- Acronyms:\\n  - Spell out on first mention with acronym in parentheses; use acronym thereafter.\\n\\nWould you like me to generate a clean, edited version of your excerpt with the changes applied?\\n\\nProposed revised excerpt (keeps your footnote placeholders):\\n- Although the New Deal did not end the Great Depression, it redefined the relationship between citizens and the federal government. Relief agencies faced criticism for being simultaneously excessive and insufficient. For example, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) created jobs for young men but reinforced prevailing gender norms.[1] Additionally, some programs excluded domestic workers, a policy that disproportionately affected Black women.[2] While the scope of reform was unprecedented, these policies had limits that revealed the era’s contradictions.\\n\\nIf you want, I can adjust the final sentence to include an explicit synthesis phrase (e.g., “Taken together, …”) or tailor diction to match the rest of your paper.\",\n    \"metrics\": {\n      \"groundtruth-eval with azure:o4-mini_2025-04-16\": {\n        \"content\": \"{\\\"explanation\\\":\\\"Mislabels “Overview” and misuses Spelling section\\\",\\\"score\\\":80}\",\n        \"score\": 80\n      }\n    },\n    \"compliance\": \"ok\",\n    \"complianceText\": \"Output follows the required structure: overview, clarifying question, categorized feedback, reasoning, and offer to rewrite.  \\nOK\",\n    \"isGroundtruth\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"ba4bd11\",\n    \"promptid\": \"b7651b1\",\n    \"ruleid\": null,\n    \"testuid\": \"baseline-test-qgzyzwyrc\",\n    \"scenario\": \"\",\n    \"baseline\": true,\n    \"testinput\": \"goals: Tighten structure, improve headings, and fix grammar; enhance readability for web\\ntype_of_writing: blog post draft\\ntarget_audience: general readers interested in productivity\\nfeedback_focus: line-by-line edits with reasoning; structural suggestions; formatting guidance for headings, lists, and links\\nformatting: web style (H2/H3, short paragraphs, scannable bullets)\\ntone_preferences: friendly, practical\\nconstraints: keep anecdotes but trim repetition; keep links intact\\ntext: Title: How I Stopped Procrastinating By Doing Less\\nIntro: I used to think I need more apps to fix my procrastination.

I’ll focus on tightening structure, improving headings, fixing grammar, and making the post more scannable for web readers, while keeping your anecdotes and any links intact.\\n\\nQuick questions to tailor the edit:\\n- Do you want to keep it to two tips, or are you open to adding a brief “Try this” checklist under each tip?\\n- Preferred length: keep it short (under ~350 words) or expand slightly with examples?\\n- Any links you plan to add (e.g., Twitter, a Not-To-Do template) I should account for in formatting?\\n\\nOverview of the solution\\n- Line-by-line edits with reasoning to correct grammar, improve clarity, and standardize style.\\n- Structural suggestions for headings (H2/H3), bullets, and brief examples under each tip for scannability.\\n- Formatting guidance for web: short paragraphs, concise sentences, clear subheads, and bullet lists.\\n\\nLine-by-line edits (with reasoning)\\n- Title: “Title: How I Stopped Procrastinating By Doing Less”\\n  - Suggestion: Remove “Title:” and use Title Case: “How I Stopped Procrastinating by Doing Less”\\n  - Reason: Cleaner presentation; standard headline capitalization. Lowercase “by” is correct in title case.\\n\\n- Intro: “I used to think I need more apps to fix my procrastination. Turns out, I needed less—less options, less tabs, less guilt.”\\n  - Suggestion: “I used to think I needed more apps to fix my procrastination. Turns out, I needed less—fewer options, fewer tabs, and less guilt.”\\n  - Reason: Past tense consistency (“needed”), correct count vs. mass noun usage (“fewer” for countable items like options/tabs; “less” for mass nouns like guilt), add “and” for smoother cadence.\\n\\n- H2: “## Tip 1: Make a Not-To-Do List”\\n  - Suggestion: Keep as is, or standardize hyphenation/capitalization: “## Tip 1: Make a Not-To-Do List”\\n  - Reason: Consistent Title Case; “Not-To-Do List” is a widely recognized term.\\n\\n- Body: “This is not negative! It focuses your attention on what you should ignore.”\\n  - Suggestion: “This isn’t negative—it helps you focus on what to ignore.”\\n  - Reason: More natural phrasing, contraction fits friendly tone, em dash improves flow, trims repetition (“you should”).\\n\\n- Example: “For example, checking Twitter every 10 minutes is a bad loop I had.”\\n  - Suggestion: “For example, checking Twitter every 10 minutes was a habit I fell into.”\\n  - Reason: Past tense alignment (“was”), “habit” is clearer than “loop,” “fell into” is idiomatic and concise.\\n\\n- H2: “## Tip 2: Set \\\"good enough\\\" deadlines”\\n  - Suggestion: “## Tip 2: Set ‘Good-Enough’ Deadlines”\\n  - Reason: Title Case for headings, hyphenate “Good-Enough” when used as a compound adjective, use consistent quotation style (single quotes in headings are optional but keep consistent; alternatively remove quotes entirely for cleaner web style: “Set Good-Enough Deadlines”).\\n\\n- Body: “Perfectionism is a trap. If you schedule shorter blocks and accept B+ work at first, you will move faster.”\\n  - Suggestion: “Perfectionism is a trap. Schedule shorter time blocks and accept B+ work initially—you’ll move faster.”\\n  - Reason: Imperative form is more direct for web; “time blocks” adds clarity; “initially” is smoother; em dash creates a tight conclusion.\\n\\n- H2: “## Conclusion”\\n  - Suggestion: Keep as is.\\n\\n- Conclusion body: “Doing less is surprisingly brave. You will feel weird at first, but then free.”\\n  - Suggestion: “Doing less can be surprisingly brave. It may feel uncomfortable at first, but the payoff is freedom.”\\n  - Reason: “Can be” softens the claim, “uncomfortable” is clearer than “weird,” and “payoff is freedom” lands with a stronger, positive close.\\n\\nOverall Feedback\\n- Strong core idea and friendly tone. The simple, actionable tips fit a productivity audience.\\n- Key improvements: fix tense consistency, “less” vs. “fewer,” and make headings uniform and scannable. Add micro-examples or bullets under each tip for quick takeaways.\\n\\nSpelling Edits\\n- No outright spelling errors found.\\n- Consistency: “Twitter” is correctly capitalized. Consider consistent quotation style (single vs. double quotes). For web headings, you can drop quotes.\\n\\nGrammar Edits\\n- Past tense in the intro: “need” → “needed.”\\n- Count vs. mass nouns: “less options/tabs” → “fewer options/fewer tabs”; “less guilt” stays “less.”\\n- Idiomatic phrasing: “bad loop I had” → “habit I fell into.”\\n- Parallel structure and concision: remove “If” and use imperative in Tip 2 for a tighter message.\\n\\nStructural Suggestions\\n- Use H2 for each tip and H3 for brief examples or mini-checklists.\\n- Add scannable bullets under each tip:\\n  - Tip 1 bullets:\\n    - Try this: Write 3 things to ignore today (e.g., “Twitter refresh,” “email tabs after 7 p.m.,” “new app trials”).\\n    - Why it works: Reduces decision fatigue and removes low-value distractions.\\n  - Tip 2 bullets:\\n    - Try this: Set a 25–30 minute block; define “B+” criteria (clear, complete, not perfect).\\n    - Why it works: Time-boxing + “good-enough” standard speeds momentum.\\n- Consider a short one-line hook before the intro to grab attention (optional): “The fastest way I beat procrastination? I started doing less.”\\n- Keep paragraphs short (1–3 sentences) and avoid long clauses for readability.\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement\\n- Add one sentence to connect the two tips: “Both strategies eliminate decision friction so you can start faster.”\\n- Optional CTA: Invite readers to try one change today and share results (e.g., comment or share).\\n- If you plan to add links (e.g., to a Not-To-Do template or a time-boxing guide), place them at the end of each tip with descriptive anchor text.\\n\\nFormatting Guidance (web style: H2/H3, short paragraphs, bullets)\\n- Headings:\\n  - H2: Tip titles (Title Case, avoid quotes when possible).\\n  - H3: Example or “Try this” under each tip.\\n- Paragraphs: 1–3 sentences each; aim for ~15–20 words per sentence.\\n- Bullets: Use simple, parallel phrasing; start with verbs (“Write,” “Set,” “Define”).\\n- Links: Use descriptive anchors (“Not-To-Do template”), keep them intact, and place them after the relevant sentence or as a bullet.\\n- Punctuation: Use em dashes sparingly for emphasis; avoid exclamation points unless intentional for tone.\\n- Consistency: Use Title Case for headings; sentence case in body copy.\\n\\nWould you like me to generate a clean, edited version with H2/H3 headings, short paragraphs, and bullets, incorporating all these changes?

I once missed a shift to take him to an appointment and was written up—and I would do it again. I’m not perfect—I still overcommit—but I’ve learned to ask for help and to say no.

Keep each step behaviorally specific so your audience can try it for 7 days.\\n\\nSpelling Edits (with reasoning)\\n- grayscale → correct as one word. Reason: Standard usage for display setting.\\n- no-phone mornings → keep hyphenated. Reason: Hyphen clarifies the compound adjective.\\n- check-ins → include hyphen. Reason: “Check-in” is hyphenated in noun form; plural is “check-ins.”\\n- “Screen time going up; attention going down.” → Keep “screen time” as two words; “attention” is correct.\\n\\nGrammar Edits (with reasoning)\\n- Hook: “Imagine if your phone is the boss of you.” → “Imagine if your phone were the boss of you.” Reason: Use the subjunctive “were” for a hypothetical.\\n- Evidence: “grades slipping, sleep shorter, I felt it last semester.” → “Grades slipped, my sleep got shorter, and I felt it last semester.” Reason: Parallel verb forms and add a conjunction to avoid a comma splice.\\n- Counter: “Phones are tools—yes, but tools shape us.” → “Phones are tools—yes. But tools also shape us.” Reason: Split into two sentences for emphasis; “also” signals concession with contrast.\\n- Solution: “3 steps: grayscale, no-phone mornings, buddy check-ins.” → “Three steps: turn on grayscale, try no-phone mornings, and set up buddy check-ins.” Reason: Spell out “three” in speech and use parallel imperative phrases.\\n- Close: “Ask audience to try it for 7 days.” → “Ask the audience to try it for seven days.” Reason: Spell out single-digit numbers in speech.\\n\\nStructural Suggestions (with reasoning)\\n- Order: Hook → Problem → Evidence (personal and one brief stat) → Counterargument → Solution (three steps) → Call to Action → Close. Reason: This sequence builds logic and motivation, keeping the audience engaged.\\n- Add transitions: Use “Here’s what that looks like,” “But there’s a catch,” and “So what can we do?” to guide listeners.\\n- Make each step concrete: Add “how,” “when,” and “why it helps” for each step to increase follow-through and fit the 7-day challenge.\\n- Time cues: Aim for roughly 30–45 seconds per early section, 2 minutes for the solution, and 1 minute for the call to action and close, totaling about 5–6 minutes.\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement\\n- Include one credible data point on attention, grades, or sleep (e.g., a brief stat from the CDC, APA, or a school survey). Keep it short: one sentence.\\n- Add a one-sentence personal anecdote to humanize the problem.\\n- Offer a simple way to measure progress (e.g., “Notice how many times you pick up your phone before lunch,” or “Track sleep for seven days”).\\n- Preempt objections: Acknowledge phones help us study and connect; you’re offering small guardrails, not a ban.\\n\\nFormatting Guidance for Speaking Notes\\n- Use clear section headers in ALL CAPS: HOOK, PROBLEM, EVIDENCE, COUNTER, SOLUTION, CALL TO ACTION, CLOSE.\\n- Keep one idea per line; aim for short phrases, not full paragraphs.\\n- Add cue words in brackets: [PAUSE], [LOOK UP], [SLOW DOWN], [SHOW OF HANDS].\\n- Put transitions on their own lines to help delivery.\\n- Include approximate time per section, so you hit 5–6 minutes.\\n- Bold is optional; if not available, use caps for emphasis; underline key phrases by writing them in caps (e.g., YOU DESERVE YOUR ATTENTION BACK).\\n\\nEdited Speaking Outline (5–6 minutes, with cue words)\\nHOOK (0:30)\\n- Imagine if your phone were the boss of you. [PAUSE] What would it tell you to do—now, now, now? [LOOK UP]\\n  Reason: Subjunctive “were” for hypothetical; short punchy questions create engagement.\\n\\nPROBLEM (0:45)\\n- Our screen time is going up; our attention is going down. [PAUSE]\\n- The cost? More distraction, less deep focus, and decisions that feel rushed.\\n  Reason: Parallel structure (“going up / going down”); names concrete consequences.\\n\\nEVIDENCE (1:00)\\n- Quick stat: Research links heavy screen use with shorter sleep and lower academic performance. [PAUSE]\\n- My example: Last semester, my grades slipped and my sleep got shorter because I kept scrolling past midnight. [SLOW DOWN]\\n  Reason: One concise research claim, plus a personal anecdote to ground the message.\\n\\nCOUNTERARGUMENT (0:45)\\n- Phones are tools—yes. But tools also shape us. [PAUSE]\\n- I’m not saying ditch your phone; I’m saying add small guardrails so the tool serves you. [LOOK UP]\\n  Reason: Acknowledge benefits; reframe as balance, not abstinence.\\n\\nTRANSITION (0:10)\\n- So what can we do—starting this week? [PAUSE]\\n  Reason: Signals the move to solutions and the 7-day challenge.\\n\\nSOLUTION: THREE STEPS (2:00)\\n- Step 1: Turn on grayscale. [PAUSE]\\n  - How: Switch your display to grayscale after 8 p.m. on weekdays. [PAUSE]\\n  - Why: Less color = fewer “click me” cues; it makes late-night scrolling less tempting.\\n  Reason: Imperative framing; time-bound instruction increases follow-through.\\n\\n- Step 2: No-phone mornings. [PAUSE]\\n  - How: For the first 30 minutes after you wake up, no social apps or texts. Start with water, stretch, and your first task. [LOOK UP]\\n  - Why: Protects your freshest attention; sets your focus before notifications set it for you.\\n  Reason: Concrete duration and replacement behaviors reduce friction.\\n\\n- Step 3: Buddy check-ins. [PAUSE]\\n  - How: Pair with a classmate today; send a one-line check-in each morning for seven days (“Grayscale on, 30-min no-phone done”). [SMILE]\\n  - Why: Accountability beats willpower. Share wins; reset if you slip.\\n  Reason: Simple script lowers barrier; normalizes imperfection.\\n\\nCALL TO ACTION (0:45)\\n- Try these three steps for seven days. Start tonight: grayscale at 8 p.m. [PAUSE]\\n- Tomorrow morning: 30 minutes no phone. [PAUSE]\\n- Before you leave class: pick a buddy. [SHOW OF HANDS] Who’s in?\\n  Reason: Break CTA into immediate, next, and today actions; invite participation.\\n\\nCLOSE (0:30)\\n- You deserve your attention back. [PAUSE] Give it seven days—and see what changes.\\n- If it helps, keep it. If not, adjust. But let your phone serve you, not boss you. [LOOK UP]\\n  Reason: Motivational yet grounded; emphasizes autonomy and experiment.\\n\\nLine-by-line Edits with Reasoning (comparing your original lines)\\n- Hook: “Imagine if your phone is the boss of you.” → “Imagine if your phone were the boss of you.”\\n  Reason: The subjunctive “were” fits hypothetical statements; it also sounds more polished in speech.\\n\\n- Problem: “Screen time going up; attention going down.” → “Our screen time is going up; our attention is going down.”\\n  Reason: Add “our” for audience inclusion; keep parallel structure for rhythm.\\n\\n- Evidence: “grades slipping, sleep shorter, I felt it last semester.” → “My grades slipped, my sleep got shorter, and I felt it last semester.”\\n  Reason: Use parallel past-tense verbs; add “my” for clarity and personal ownership; include “and” to avoid a comma splice.\\n\\n- Counter: “Phones are tools—yes, but tools shape us.” → “Phones are tools—yes. But tools also shape us.”\\n  Reason: Split for emphasis; “also” signals concession then contrast, improving flow.\\n\\n- Solution: “3 steps: grayscale, no-phone mornings, buddy check-ins.” → “Three steps: turn on grayscale, try no-phone mornings, and set up buddy check-ins.”\\n  Reason: Spell out numbers in speech; use parallel imperative phrases to make the plan actionable.\\n\\n- Close: “You deserve your attention back.” Ask audience to try it for 7 days. → “You deserve your attention back. Try it for seven days.”\\n  Reason: Keep the impactful sentence; make the call to action direct; spell out “seven.”\\n\\nWould you like me to generate a full speech script based on this outline (about 900–1,000 words for 5–6 minutes)?

Before I dive in, quick check: Do you have a preferred tense for the narrative (e.g., mostly past tense with present reflections at the end), and is there any word count or teacher requirement I should keep in mind?\\n\\nOverview of the guidance I’ll provide\\n- I’ll make line-by-line edits to fix tense consistency, clarify chronology, and improve sentence variety and flow while keeping all major events and avoiding fictional additions.\\n- I’ll explain the reasoning for each change.\\n- I’ll offer structural suggestions to strengthen the arc (injury → therapy → progress → track lesson).\\n- I’ll point out opportunities to enhance clarity and reflection without inventing details.\\n- I’ll provide formatting tips for a standard essay paragraph.\\n\\nOverall Feedback\\n- The core idea is strong: the injury becomes the catalyst for a hopeful commitment to track and a lesson in patience and progress.\\n- Your main challenge is tense inconsistency (mixing present and past) and a slightly unclear timeline.\\n- With consistent past tense in the narrative and a present/reflection sentence at the end, the piece will read more smoothly and feel more confident.\\n- A few small wording changes will clarify the chronology and improve sentence variety without changing your story.\\n\\nSpelling Edits\\n- No spelling errors detected in the original text.\\n\\nGrammar Edits (line-by-line with reasoning)\\n1) Original: “The day I broke my ankle is the day I decided to join track, which doesn’t make sense until I explain.”\\n   Suggested edit: “The day I broke my ankle was the day I decided to join track—a choice that makes more sense once I explain.”\\n   Reasoning:\\n   - Switch “is” to “was” to match past-tense narration.\\n   - “A choice that makes more sense once I explain” is slightly tighter and avoids the vague “which.”\\n   - The em dash adds variety and emphasis.\\n\\n2) Original: “I am limping down the stairs last winter when the ice was invisible, and then I fell.”\\n   Suggested edit: “Last winter, I was limping down the stairs when I hit invisible ice, and I fell.”\\n   Reasoning:\\n   - Change “I am limping” to “I was limping” to keep past tense with “last winter.”\\n   - “Hit invisible ice” is a clear, concise phrase that explains the slip without adding new fictional detail.\\n   - Replace “and then I fell” with “and I fell” to streamline the action.\\n\\n   Note: If “limping” here means you were already injured before this fall, consider clarifying. If you were just moving cautiously, “walking carefully” may be more precise. I didn’t change it because it might be true to your experience.\\n\\n3) Original: “Later, in physical therapy, I learn patience I didn’t know I had.”\\n   Suggested edit: “Later, in physical therapy, I learned patience I didn’t know I had.”\\n   Reasoning:\\n   - “Learned” keeps the narrative in past tense.\\n   - The rest of the sentence reads well and supports the reflective tone.\\n\\n4) Original: “By spring I was jogging, then I am running.”\\n   Suggested edit: “By spring, I was jogging; then I was running.”\\n   Reasoning:\\n   - Make both verbs past tense for consistency.\\n   - Use a semicolon to add sentence variety and show progression.\\n   - Keep “then” to maintain your original timeline without adding specifics.\\n\\n5) Original: “Joining track taught me to measure progress in millimeters before it shows up as miles.”\\n   Suggested edit (Option A, fully past tense): “Joining track taught me to measure progress in millimeters before it showed up as miles.”\\n   Suggested edit (Option B, reflective present perfect): “Joining track has taught me to measure progress in millimeters before it shows up as miles.”\\n   Reasoning:\\n   - Option A keeps the entire piece in past tense.\\n   - Option B shifts to present reflection at the end, which can feel more hopeful and ongoing. Choose based on your preference and teacher guidelines.\\n\\nStructural Suggestions\\n- Keep this as one cohesive paragraph for a portfolio, but ensure the chronology is crystal clear:\\n  1) Hook with the ankle-break/decision sentence.\\n  2) Describe the fall (winter → stairs → invisible ice → fall).\\n  3) Move to physical therapy and the patience lesson.\\n  4) Mark progress (spring → jogging → running).\\n  5) Conclude with the broader takeaway about measuring progress (either in past tense or present perfect).\\n- Consider adding one brief transition phrase between therapy and spring to smooth the time jump, e.g., “After weeks of exercises,” only if it’s accurate to your experience. If not, the current “By spring…” works.\\n- If you expand this for a longer essay, split into two paragraphs: (1) incident and decision; (2) recovery and lesson.\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement\\n- Clarify “limping”: If you were limping before the fall, a brief clarification would prevent confusion. If you weren’t, consider “walking carefully” or “moving slowly” (only if true).\\n- Add one reflective phrase to deepen the hopeful tone without inventing events, e.g., “steady, patient steps” or “small gains that mattered”—only if these match your experience.\\n- Vary sentence openings to avoid repetition (start one sentence with a time phrase, another with a participial phrase, etc.). The edits above already introduce some of this variety.\\n\\nFormatting Guidance\\n- For a standard essay paragraph in a portfolio:\\n  - Use Times New Roman or a similar serif font, 12-point, double-spaced, with 1-inch margins.\\n  - Indent the first line of the paragraph.\\n  - Keep consistent tense choice: either all past, or past with a final present-perfect reflection.\\n  - Include a strong concluding sentence that ties the learning to your growth as a student/athlete.\\n\\nWould you like me to rewrite the paragraph with these edits applied? I can provide two versions (all past tense vs. ending in present perfect) so you can choose which fits your portfolio.\\n\\nIf helpful now, here are both edited versions:\\n\\nVersion A (all past tense):\\n“The day I broke my ankle was the day I decided to join track—a choice that makes more sense once I explain. Last winter, I was limping down the stairs when I hit invisible ice, and I fell. Later, in physical therapy, I learned patience I didn’t know I had. By spring, I was jogging; then I was running. Joining track taught me to measure progress in millimeters before it showed up as miles.”\\n\\nVersion B (ending in present reflection):\\n“The day I broke my ankle was the day I decided to join track—a choice that makes more sense once I explain.

Optional: “the way it helped me organise my thoughts” can sound slightly more formal than “how,” but both are fine.\\n   - Optional tense alignment (if you want immediacy): “I’ve realised that my favourite part of the programme is the way it helps me organise my thoughts.” This shifts to present-perfect and present tense to emphasise a current insight.\\n\\n2) “It wasn’t glamorous, but the colour-coded cards made revision feel possible again.”\\n   - Correct use of comma before “but” to join two independent clauses.\\n   - Optional word choice: “achievable” or “manageable” may be slightly stronger than “possible,” as they imply practicality rather than mere possibility.\\n\\n3) “If I can keep this habit, I’ll be more consistent next term.”\\n   - Correct comma after the introductory clause.\\n   - If you mean commitment rather than ability, consider: “If I keep this habit, I’ll be more consistent next term.” Using “can” emphasises ability; omitting it emphasises intention.\\n\\nStructural Suggestions\\n- For a short reflective paragraph, your three-sentence structure is effective: past insight → practical method → forward-looking goal.\\n- If you prefer a tighter tense flow, consider making all sentences present-focused: “I’ve realised… It isn’t… If I keep…”. This presents the reflection as current and ongoing. Otherwise, the original past-to-future progression is perfectly fine.\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement\\n- Strengthen specificity slightly: “colour-coded cards” could briefly note purpose (e.g., “colour-coded cue cards for topics and formulas”) if you want to show method, but this is optional given the paragraph’s brevity.\\n- Word choice: swap “possible” for “achievable” or “manageable” to underscore practicality.\\n\\nFormatting Guidance (UK conventions)\\n- Paragraph length: one compact paragraph is appropriate; keep it to 3–5 sentences for clarity.\\n- Hyphenation: “colour-coded” is correctly hyphenated as a compound adjective before the noun.\\n- Apostrophes: “wasn’t” and “I’ll” are correctly contracted; use smart (curly) apostrophes if typesetting permits, but straight apostrophes are fine for plain text.\\n- Quotation marks: use single quotes for quoted words/phrases if needed (UK convention), though none are required here.\\n- Spacing and punctuation: one space after full stops; avoid extra spaces before commas/full stops.\\n- Maintain -ise/-yse spellings consistently in future writing (organise, analyse) to match UK preference.\\n\\nWould you like anything else?\\n- Would you like me to keep the original tense, or rewrite with the present-perfect immediacy?\\n- Do you prefer “achievable” or “manageable” instead of “possible”?\\n\\nOffer to generate the edited text\\n- Minimal-edit version (keeping your tone and structure, with one optional word choice):\\n  “I realised that my favourite part of the programme was how it helped me organise my thoughts.

To strengthen the analytical tone, clarify the thesis so it indicates your criteria and the conditional judgment (e.g., convenience vs deep reading).\\n- Eliminate comma splices by using colons/semicolons appropriately or by splitting into separate sentences.\\n- Tighten phrasing and make subject references explicit (“it loses meaning” → “the highlighting loses its meaning”).\\n\\nSpelling Edits\\n- ebooks → e-books\\n  Reason: Hyphenation is standard in formal writing when “e-” is used as a prefix.\\n- don’t → do not\\n  Reason: MLA essays generally avoid contractions for a more formal tone.\\n\\nGrammar Edits (line-by-line with reasoning)\\n1) Original: “While ebooks are convenient because you can carry many in one device, print books have advantages too, they are easier on the eyes and don’t need batteries.”\\n   Edited: “While e-books are convenient because you can carry many on one device, print books also have advantages: they are easier on the eyes and do not need batteries.”\\n   Why: \\n   - Changed “ebooks” to “e-books” (spelling/formality).\\n   - “in one device” → “on one device” (correct preposition).\\n   - “print books have advantages too, they are…” was a comma splice. Replaced with a colon to introduce the list of advantages.\\n   - Removed contraction for MLA formality.\\n\\n2) Original: “Also I think annotations feel different, on a screen I highlight too much and it loses meaning, with paper I slow down more.”\\n   Edited: “Also, annotations feel different: on a screen, I tend to highlight too much, and the highlighting loses its meaning; with paper, I slow down more.”\\n   Why:\\n   - Comma after the introductory adverb “Also.”\\n   - Removed “I think” to reduce hedging and strengthen the analytical tone.\\n   - Used a colon to introduce examples and a semicolon to link two closely related independent clauses (avoids run-ons).\\n   - Clarified the vague pronoun “it” to “the highlighting,” improving precision.\\n\\n3) Original: “Both formats can be good but it depends on the reader and the situation.”\\n   Edited: “Ultimately, both formats can be effective, but the better choice depends on the reader and the purpose.”\\n   Why:\\n   - Added “Ultimately” for a concluding signal.\\n   - Inserted a comma before “but” to separate independent clauses.\\n   - “effective” is slightly more formal than “good.”\\n   - “purpose” is more specific than “situation,” supporting analytical comparison.\\n\\nStructural Suggestions (compare/contrast)\\n- Point-by-point is ideal for your criteria-driven comparison. Suggested outline:\\n  - Thesis: Establish conditional judgment based on purpose (portability vs deep reading).\\n  - Point 1: Portability — e-books excel; print books are limited.\\n  - Point 2: Readability/eye comfort — print books often easier on the eyes; screens can strain.\\n  - Point 3: Annotation — screen highlighting can become excessive; paper slows you down and adds focus.\\n  - Point 4: Power dependence — e-books require batteries; print books do not.\\n  - Conclusion: The preferable format depends on whether the goal is quick access or sustained, attentive reading.\\n- Block structure (all e-book points, then all print points) can work for longer essays, but with your focused criteria, point-by-point will keep comparisons clear and analytical.\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement\\n- Strengthen the thesis to name the criteria and the conditional choice (e.g., convenience vs comprehension).\\n- Maintain parallelism when listing advantages (e.g., “easier on the eyes and independent of batteries”).\\n- Consider reducing first-person if your teacher prefers objectivity: “On screens, highlighting often becomes excessive…” instead of “I highlight too much.”\\n- Vary sentence starts (not all with “Also” or “Ultimately”) and use transitions like “Moreover,” “In contrast,” “However.”\\n\\nFormatting Guidance (MLA basics)\\n- Use 12-point Times New Roman, double-spaced, 1-inch margins.\\n- Header: Your Name, Teacher’s Name, Course, Date (in day month year), top left.\\n- Page numbers: Last name and page number in the upper right header.\\n- Title: Centered, standard capitalization, no bold/underline.\\n- Avoid contractions; use present tense consistently for general comparisons.\\n- No sources needed here—so no in-text citations or Works Cited for this excerpt.\\n\\nWould you like me to keep first-person examples or shift them to a more objective tone?\\n\\nEdited text options\\n\\nOption A: Minimal changes (keeps your voice)\\n- “While e-books are convenient because you can carry many on one device, print books also have advantages: they are easier on the eyes and do not need batteries. Also, annotations feel different: on a screen, I tend to highlight too much, and the highlighting loses its meaning; with paper, I slow down more. Ultimately, both formats can be effective, but the better choice depends on the reader and the purpose.”\\n\\nOption B: More formal, thesis-forward (reduced first-person)\\n- “While e-books offer superior portability, print books provide greater eye comfort and require no batteries. Annotations also differ across formats: on screens, highlighting often becomes excessive and loses its meaning, whereas paper annotation encourages a slower, more attentive pace. Ultimately, both formats can be effective; the better choice depends on the reader’s purpose—quick access versus deep reading.”\\n\\nWould you like me to generate a point-by-point outline for a full essay based on these ideas, or further revise one of the options to fit your teacher’s preferences?\",\n    \"metrics\": {\n      \"groundtruth-eval with azure:o4-mini_2025-04-16\": {\n        \"content\": \"{\\\"score\\\":100,\\\"explanation\\\":\\\"All required sections and elements are present and compliant\\\"}\",\n        \"score\": 100\n      }\n    },\n    \"compliance\": \"ok\",\n    \"complianceText\": \"Clear, structured feedback with all required categories and reasoning present.  \\nOK\",\n    \"isGroundtruth\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"3e079ef\",\n    \"promptid\": \"b7651b1\",\n    \"ruleid\": null,\n    \"testuid\": \"baseline-test-070pu2o42\",\n    \"scenario\": \"\",\n    \"baseline\": true,\n    \"testinput\": \"goals: Improve clarity and specificity; fix article usage and verb forms; suggest a stronger conclusion\\ntype_of_writing: film analysis paragraph\\ntarget_audience: class blog readers\\nfeedback_focus: line-by-line edits with reasoning; structural suggestions; formatting for italics of film titles\\nformatting: web post with italics for titles\\ntone_preferences: thoughtful, concise\\nconstraints: keep chosen scene; no spoilers beyond first 30 minutes\\ntext: In the opening of The Martian, the storm scene shows how group decision under pressure can go wrong.

It was buggy at first, but they fixed it together.”\\n   - Reasoning: Fixes a comma splice by making two sentences; adds a comma after the introductory phrase; “at first” is concise and improves flow.\\n\\n5) Original: “The room feels like a lab and a living room at once.”\\n   - Suggested: “The room feels like both a lab and a living room.”\\n   - Reasoning: “Both … and …” is concise and clearer than “at once.”\\n\\nStructural Suggestions\\n- Lead/nut graf: Add one sentence at the top with school name and a brief purpose (“The coding club at [School Name], started in [semester/year], welcomes students who want to explore programming in a supportive setting.”).\\n- Context: Consider one sentence explaining how often the club meets or the number of participants (AP style: use numerals for 10 and above).\\n- Flow: Current sequence works well—introduction → quote → description → example → image. The example (“bus schedules” app) nicely shows collaboration; keep it immediately after the quote for impact.\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement\\n- Attribution variety: After first mention, use “Johnson said” instead of “she said” to align with AP style and clarity (especially if multiple speakers appear later).\\n- Specifics: If available, add details like meeting times (“Wednesdays after school”), location (room number), or outcomes (e.g., whether the app is used by students). This deepens the profile without changing the quotes.\\n- Respectful portrayal: “Diverse backgrounds and abilities” is good; avoid phrasing that implies deficit (e.g., “struggling kids”). Your current language is respectful—just keep it consistent.\\n\\nFormatting Guidance (AP style)\\n- Quotes and attribution:\\n  - Use double quotation marks.\\n  - Place periods and commas inside quotation marks.\\n  - Preferred format when splitting a quote: “Sentence,” Johnson said. “Second sentence.”\\n  - Keep the interviewee’s words exactly as spoken; you may break long quotes around the attribution without changing the words.\\n- Courtesy titles:\\n  - AP style typically avoids courtesy titles; use “Johnson” after first reference. If your school’s style uses “Ms.” for teachers, keep it consistently.\\n- Numbers:\\n  - Spell out one through nine; use numerals for 10 and above.\\n  - Use numerals for time and dates (e.g., 3 p.m., Sept. 21).\\n- Hyphenation:\\n  - “after-school” is hyphenated when used as a compound modifier (“after-school coding club”).\\n- Job descriptions:\\n  - Lowercase generic titles after names (“math teacher”) unless used before a name as a formal title (e.g., “Principal Maria Lopez”).\\n- Composition:\\n  - Keep paragraphs concise; one to three sentences per graf is fine for school newspaper style.\\n\\nWould you like me to incorporate these edits into a clean, AP-style version?\\n\\nProposed edited version (quotes kept verbatim):\\nMs. Johnson, a veteran and math teacher, started the after-school coding club to support students who feel left out of technology. “Everybody can learn to code,” she said. “We just need a place to try and fail safely.” The club includes students with diverse backgrounds and abilities, and members pair up to solve small problems.

To make this effective for the general public, avoid meta statements (like “I was going to add more later”) in the final paragraph, and connect weather impacts directly to climate change so the cause-and-effect relationship is clear.\\n- Aim for specific examples (droughts, floods, unpredictable seasons) and simple, direct language.\\n- Keep tense consistent and avoid filler phrases (“kind of,” “a lot”) unless they add meaning.\\n\\nSpelling Edits (with explanations):\\n- “effecting” → “affecting”\\n  - “Affecting” means “influencing or having an impact on.” “Effecting” means “causing to happen,” which isn’t the intended meaning here.\\n- “alot” → “a lot”\\n  - “A lot” is two words in standard English.\\n- “its good” → “it’s good”\\n  - Use “it’s” (it is). “Its” is possessive.\\n\\nGrammar and Phrasing Edits (with explanations):\\n- Original: “Weather is effecting farmers alot.”\\n  - Suggested: “Extreme weather is affecting farmers a lot.”\\n  - Why: Correct spelling and verb; add “Extreme” to be more precise. Consider replacing “a lot” with “significantly” or describing how (e.g., “by reducing yields and raising costs”) for specificity.\\n- Original: “The data are scattered and I was going to add more later.”\\n  - Suggested (general public style): “The available data are scattered, and I plan to add more later.”\\n  - Why: “Plan” keeps tense consistent; “available” clarifies what’s scattered. For a finished essay, remove meta-process notes entirely and present one or two specific data points instead.\\n- Original: “It’s kind of messy, and I don’t know if its good.”\\n  - Suggested: “It’s a bit messy, and I’m not sure it reads well.”\\n  - Why: Replace filler (“kind of”) with “a bit,” correct “it’s,” and be specific about what “good” means (clarity/readability). For the final essay, avoid self-assessment and simply present a clean paragraph.\\n\\nStructural Suggestions:\\n- Use a clear 3–4 sentence structure:\\n  1) Topic sentence: connect climate change to weather and farmers.\\n  2) Supporting detail: examples of impacts (droughts, floods, unpredictable seasons).\\n  3) Optional evidence: one clear statistic or observed trend (cite a credible source if you have one).\\n  4) Closing sentence: why it matters or what should happen next (adaptation/support/emissions reductions).\\n- Remove meta commentary (“I was going to add more later”) from the final paragraph. Keep that note in your draft, not in the published text.\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement:\\n- Replace vague phrases (“a lot,” “kind of messy”) with concrete examples.\\n- Clarify the weather–climate link (e.g., “Climate change is intensifying extreme weather…”).\\n- If you include data, choose one or two key numbers with plain-language context and a source.\\n- Use active voice and short sentences to increase readability.\\n\\nFormatting Guidance:\\n- For a short general-public essay, stick to one concise paragraph (3–5 sentences).\\n- Use plain language, avoid jargon, and define terms briefly if needed (e.g., “extreme weather”).\\n- If you expand to multiple paragraphs, add a short subheading and break up ideas for readability.\\n\\nWould you like me to rewrite this into a clean, ready-to-share paragraph now?

I’ll give line-by-line edits with reasoning, then broader guidance on structure, transitions, and stance.\\n\\nQuick questions to tailor the edit:\\n- Do you need to include evidence or citations (studies, school policy examples)?\\n- Are you required to address counterarguments (e.g., cost, student expression)?\\n- What length is the essay (word count or number of paragraphs)?\\n- Any specific formatting (MLA, APA) or rubric requirements from your teacher?\\n\\nOverview of how I’ll help:\\n- Clarify and sharpen your thesis so it gives a strong, specific stance and previews your main reasons.\\n- Replace meta-commentary with purposeful sentences suitable for your essay introduction.\\n- Suggest effective transitions and a logical structure for your body paragraphs and conclusion.\\n- Offer multiple thesis options and a sample introduction paragraph you can use or adapt.\\n\\nLine-by-line edits with reasoning:\\n1) Original: “School uniforms should be adopted because they reduce bullying.”\\n   Suggested edit: “Schools should require uniforms because standardizing dress reduces status competition and appearance-based bullying.”\\n   Why: “Should require” is more direct and active than “should be adopted.” Adding “standardizing dress” and “appearance-based bullying” clarifies the mechanism and narrows the claim for precision.\\n\\n2) Original: “However my thesis is vague and I don't consistently support claims.”\\n   Suggested edit: Remove from the essay.\\n   Why: This is self-referential meta-commentary, not content your audience needs. If you want a planning sentence, you can instead write: “This essay explains how uniforms curb bullying and supports the claim with evidence from schools and research.” But typically, just use a clear thesis and let the body paragraphs provide support.\\n\\n3) Original: “I want stronger transitions and a clearer stance.”\\n   Suggested edit: Remove from the essay.\\n   Why: Also meta-commentary. Replace with an actual clear stance (the revised thesis) and use transitions within and between body paragraphs.\\n\\nOverall Feedback:\\n- Your core claim is solid, but it needs a stronger, more specific thesis that states how uniforms reduce bullying (the mechanism) and previews the points you’ll argue.\\n- Remove self-referential sentences from the draft; replace them with argumentative content.\\n- Use consistent, active voice and topic sentences that directly support the thesis.\\n- Integrate transitions that show logical progression: begin with mechanism, move to evidence, then address counterarguments before concluding.\\n\\nSpelling Edits:\\n- No spelling errors in your text.\\n\\nGrammar Edits:\\n- Add a comma after introductory “However” if you keep that sentence in any future draft: “However, …”\\n- Prefer active voice (“schools should require”) over passive (“should be adopted”) for a stronger, more persuasive tone.\\n- Avoid first-person meta-statements in an argumentative essay unless your assignment encourages reflection.\\n\\nStructural Suggestions:\\n- Introduction: Hook, brief context, precise thesis.\\n- Body paragraph 1 (Mechanism): Explain how uniforms reduce visible status markers and remove appearance-based targets for bullying.\\n- Body paragraph 2 (Evidence): Present examples or data from school districts or studies showing reduced bullying incidents after uniform adoption.\\n- Body paragraph 3 (Counterargument and rebuttal): Acknowledge concerns (cost, individuality) and rebut with solutions (assistance programs, optional accessories, focus on safety).\\n- Conclusion: Restate thesis in fresh words, synthesize key points, and end with a call to action or implication (e.g., schools should pilot uniform policies with equity supports).\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement:\\n- Define bullying briefly (appearance-based teasing, brand shaming) to focus your claim.\\n- Specify the scope (e.g., public middle and high schools) to avoid overgeneralization.\\n- Support claims with credible sources (district reports, education research) or real-world examples; avoid overclaiming causation without evidence.\\n- Use clear topic sentences that tie directly back to the thesis at the start of each body paragraph.\\n- Maintain parallel structure when listing reasons: “reduces status competition, removes appearance-based targets, and fosters a sense of belonging.”\\n\\nFormatting Guidance:\\n- Use a standard argumentative format: double-spaced, readable font, clear paragraph breaks, and consistent heading style if required by your teacher.\\n- If citing sources, include in-text citations and a works cited page (MLA is common for high school).\\n- Keep paragraphs focused: one main idea per paragraph with a strong topic sentence and concluding link back to the thesis.\\n\\nStronger thesis options (choose one or adapt):\\n- “Public schools should require uniforms because standardizing dress reduces status competition, removes appearance-based targets for bullying, and builds a culture of belonging.”\\n- “To make campuses safer, schools should require uniforms; by removing visible status markers, uniforms cut the fuel for bullying and refocus attention on learning.”\\n- “Schools should adopt uniforms to reduce bullying: when clothing is standardized, students have fewer reasons to judge, isolate, or harass peers over appearance or brand.”\\n\\nSample introduction paragraph (ready to use or adapt):\\n- “No student should dread walking into school because of what they wear. Bullying often targets appearance—brands, styles, and price tags become excuses to judge and exclude. Schools should require uniforms because standardizing dress reduces status competition and appearance-based bullying. By removing visible markers that separate students into ‘haves’ and ‘have-nots,’ uniforms help create a more respectful environment where attention can return to learning.”\\n\\nSample topic sentences and transitions:\\n- Body 1: “First, uniforms reduce status competition by eliminating the brand and style differences that often trigger teasing.”\\n- Body 2: “Moreover, schools that adopt uniform policies report fewer appearance-based conflicts, suggesting uniforms help curb bullying.”\\n- Body 3 (counterargument): “Critics argue that uniforms limit self-expression and can be costly; however, schools can allow personal accessories and provide assistance programs, maintaining safety without sacrificing equity.”\\n- Conclusion: “Ultimately, by removing appearance-based targets and promoting belonging, uniforms are a practical step schools can take to reduce bullying.”\\n\\nWould you like me to rewrite your thesis, introduction, and an outline for the full essay based on your assignment length and requirements?

Professional readers prefer clear value statements and a specific next step.\\n- Replace outdated or impersonal salutations (“Dear Sir or Madam”) with a name or role-based greeting.\\n- Remove or shorten cliché openers (“I hope this email finds you well”) to keep the message concise and professional.\\n- Make the call to action specific (e.g., propose a time for a call or invite them to request a proposal).\\n\\nSpelling Edits\\n- “Please let me know if you have any question.” → “Please let me know if you have any questions.”\\n  Reason: “Questions” should be plural when referring to any number of potential questions.\\n\\nGrammar Edits\\n- “We offer services that is tailored to your needs” → “We offer services that are tailored to your needs”\\n  Reason: Subject–verb agreement. “Services” is plural, so use “are.”\\n- “...and we want to ensure your satisfaction, we will be happy to help.” → Split into two sentences or use a coordinating conjunction.\\n  Reason: Comma splice. Two independent clauses joined by a comma should be separated by a period, semicolon, or conjunction.\\n- Pronoun consistency: You switch from “we” to “me” in the last sentence.\\n  Suggestion: Use “we” throughout if writing on behalf of the company, or “I” if writing as a representative.\\n\\nStructural Suggestions\\n- Use a clear, direct opener that states your value: what you do and why it matters to the client.\\n- Follow with a brief assurance or benefit (commitment to satisfaction).\\n- End with a specific call to action (propose a meeting, invite a reply, provide contact details).\\n- If this is a letter, include a professional sign-off and full contact details. If it’s an email, add a relevant subject line and keep paragraphs short.\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement\\n- Add one sentence describing the specific services or outcomes (e.g., “We help [type of client] achieve [result] through [service].”).\\n- Include a brief credibility element (e.g., years in business, notable clients, or a quick metric).\\n- Offer a concrete next step with a suggested time (e.g., “Could we schedule a 15-minute call next week?”).\\n- Personalize the greeting with the recipient’s name or role.\\n\\nFormatting Guidance\\n- Business letter:\\n  - Your Name, Title, Company, Address, Phone, Email\\n  - Date\\n  - Recipient Name, Title, Company, Address\\n  - Salutation\\n  - 2–3 short paragraphs (value, benefit, CTA)\\n  - Professional closing (Sincerely/Best regards) + signature block\\n- Business email:\\n  - Subject line (clear benefit, concise)\\n  - Greeting with name\\n  - 2 short paragraphs (value + CTA)\\n  - Signature with full contact info\\n\\nLine-by-line edits with reasoning\\n\\nOriginal: “Dear Sir or Madam,”\\n- Edit: “Dear [Recipient’s Name],” or “Dear [Title/Team],”\\n- Reason: “Dear Sir or Madam” is dated and impersonal.

I help edit writing line by line and give clear, constructive feedback on tone, clarity, grammar, structure, and formatting. Before we dive in, two quick questions to tailor the feedback:\\n- What is your central message in one sentence (for example: “Curiosity drives me to explore biology through hands-on problem solving”)?\\n- Which specific anecdotes are you considering (e.g., a lab project, fieldwork, a challenge you overcame)? And what word count are you targeting?\\n\\nOverview of the approach\\n- I’ll give precise line-by-line edits of the text you shared, with reasoning.\\n- I’ll then provide categorized feedback on tone, concision, authenticity, and structure tailored to a college admissions audience.\\n- I’ll suggest how to link anecdotes to your central message and keep the tone confident yet humble.\\n- If you want, I can draft a revised opening or the full personal statement after we discuss your anecdotes.\\n\\nLine-by-line edits with reasoning\\n1) Original: “Growing up in a small town taught me resilience and curiosity.”\\n   - Edited: “Growing up in a small town shaped my resilience and curiosity.”\\n   - Reasoning: “Shaped” is more concise and feels less cliché than “taught me,” while still showing growth. Consider replacing abstract traits (“resilience,” “curiosity”) with a concrete detail later (e.g., a specific moment or habit) to convey authenticity.\\n\\n2) Original: “I want to show my passion for biology without sounding arrogant.”\\n   - Edited: “I aim to convey my passion for biology with humility.”\\n   - Reasoning: Positive framing (“convey … with humility”) is concise and avoids the meta “show” language. In the essay itself, don’t state this intent—demonstrate it through choices, actions, and reflective insight.\\n\\n3) Original: “I’m not sure if my anecdotes connect to my central message or if the tone fits my audience.”\\n   - Edited: “I’m working to ensure my anecdotes reinforce a clear central message and suit a college admissions audience.”\\n   - Reasoning: More assertive and concise (“working to ensure” + “reinforce a clear central message”). In the essay, replace uncertainty with clear transitions and reflective sentences that explicitly tie each anecdote to your message.\\n\\nOverall Feedback\\n- Authenticity: Avoid general claims (“resilience,” “curiosity”) unless you ground them in vivid, specific moments. Specifics make you memorable and humble.\\n- Concision: Replace meta statements (what you want to show) with actions and reflection. Trim filler (“I want to,” “I’m not sure if”) and use strong verbs.\\n- Tone for admissions: Confident, reflective, and collaborative. Show impact on others or learning from setbacks. Avoid grandiose language and excessive self-praise.\\n- Connection: After each anecdote, include a 1–2 sentence reflection that ties it back to your central message and forward to your future goals in biology.\\n\\nSpelling Edits\\n- No spelling errors in the lines you shared.\\n- Note: “college admissions committee” is your audience; if you reference them, use “college admissions readers” or “the admissions committee” for clarity and consistency.\\n\\nGrammar Edits\\n- Strengthen verb choice: “shaped” or “cultivated” instead of “taught me” for a smoother, less didactic tone.\\n- Avoid meta phrasing: Instead of “I want to show,” demonstrate through a specific example and reflective insight.\\n- Parallel structure: When you list two aims (“connect to my central message” and “fit my audience”), make them parallel—e.g., “reinforce a clear central message and suit a college admissions audience.”\\n\\nStructural Suggestions\\n- Suggested outline for a concise, authentic personal statement (650 words max):\\n  1) Hook: A specific moment that reveals curiosity or resilience (one vivid image or action).\\n  2) Pivot: Brief context—small-town background—without clichés; tie the moment to your values.\\n  3) Biology Focus: One or two concrete experiences (experiment, project, fieldwork). Use sensory or technical details sparingly to show competence.\\n  4) Reflection: What you learned (intellectual growth, ethics, collaboration, humility). This is where you keep tone grounded and avoid arrogance.\\n  5) Impact and Future: How these experiences shape what you hope to explore in college biology (not name-dropping programs yet, just direction).\\n  6) Closing: Return to the opening image or idea, showing continuity and purpose.\\n\\n- How to connect anecdotes:\\n  - After each anecdote, add a reflection sentence starting with “This taught me…” or “I realized…” then end with a forward-looking line: “Because of this, I now…” This explicitly ties the story to the central message and your trajectory.\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement\\n- Replace abstractions with specifics: One concrete detail (equipment used, problem solved, a question you asked) communicates more than labels.\\n- Show humility through process: Include a small failure or misconception you corrected. Admissions readers value teachability.\\n- Use active verbs: “analyzed,” “cultured,” “designed,” “mentored,” “iterated” instead of passive phrasing.\\n- Limit themes: Focus on 1–2 core ideas (e.g., curiosity + collaborative problem-solving). Too many themes dilute impact.\\n- Audience fit: Emphasize learning, ethics, and collaboration over prestige or competition.\\n\\nFormatting Guidance\\n- Common App essays: Plain text; paragraph breaks are preserved, but extra formatting (bold/italics) is not. Aim for 3–5 short paragraphs.\\n- Keep line lengths readable; avoid long blocks of text. Use a clear, simple font when drafting (for your own readability).\\n- No title needed unless it genuinely adds meaning; you can start directly with the hook.\\n- Avoid quotation-heavy openings; one brief, concrete sentence is stronger than a long setup.\\n\\nWould you like further assistance?\\n- If you share your draft and the specific anecdotes, I can provide detailed line-by-line edits and tighten the prose while preserving your voice.\\n- I can also draft a revised opening paragraph that balances authenticity and humility.\\n\\nOffer to generate edited text\\n- If helpful, I can turn your three meta sentences into a concise thesis-style opening you could adapt:\\n  - “Raised in a town where answers weren’t handed to me, I learned to ask better questions. That habit now shapes how I approach biology—curious, persistent, and grounded in what I can learn from mistakes.”\\n- Or, send your full draft, and I’ll rewrite it incorporating all suggested changes.\",\n    \"metrics\": {\n      \"groundtruth-eval with azure:o4-mini_2025-04-16\": {\n        \"content\": \"{\\\"explanation\\\":\\\"Mislabels sections and edit lists\\\",\\\"score\\\":30}\",\n        \"score\": 30\n      }\n    },\n    \"compliance\": \"ok\",\n    \"complianceText\": \"Fits the described structure: initial questions, overview, line edits, all feedback categories, offers next steps.  \\nOK\",\n    \"isGroundtruth\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"e83089f\",\n    \"promptid\": \"b7651b1\",\n    \"ruleid\": 5,\n    \"rule\": \"The “Spelling Edits” section must present itemized bullet points, each bullet identifying a specific misspelling from the user’s text, supplying the corrected spelling, and explaining the reason for the correction.\",\n    \"inverse\": false,\n    \"testuid\": \"test-31065314\",\n    \"scenario\": \"\",\n    \"baseline\": false,\n    \"testinput\": \"goal: fix spelling errors and polish tone type: cover letter audience: hiring manager feedback: spelling-focused text: I am definately interested in the position and hope to recieve a response soon.

I can help with grammar-focused, line-by-line edits for your reflective essay aimed at a teacher. Before we begin, do you prefer US or UK English? (For example, in US English “team” is usually singular—“the team was”—while UK English often uses plural—“the team were.”) Also, would you like minimal edits only, or a slightly polished rewrite for clarity?\\n\\nOverview of what I’ll do\\n- Focus on grammar, tense consistency, subject–verb agreement, modifiers, and punctuation.\\n- Keep your reflective tone and make phrasing clear and idiomatic for a teacher audience.\\n- Provide line-by-line edits with reasons, then offer a clean revised version if you want it.\\n\\nOverall Feedback\\n- Your ideas are clear and sequential: you present a result, describe work and effort, and end with team celebration.\\n- The main grammar issues are subject–verb agreement, inconsistent tense, a dangling modifier, and a comma splice.\\n- A few phrases can be made more idiomatic and precise (e.g., “successful in the project” → “successful on the project” or “successful in completing the project”).\\n\\nSpelling Edits\\n- No spelling errors detected.\\n\\nGrammar Edits (line-by-line with explanations)\\n1) Original: “The results shows that I was successful in the project.”\\n   - Edit: “The results show that I was successful on the project.”\\n   - Why: “Results” is plural, so use “show,” not “shows.” “Successful on the project” is more idiomatic than “successful in the project.” Alternative: “The results show that I was successful in completing the project,” which is even clearer.\\n\\n2) Original: “I was working on the report and finish it yesterday.”\\n   - Edit (simple past for consistency): “I worked on the report and finished it yesterday.”\\n   - Why: Keep the same tense within the sentence. “Yesterday” calls for simple past. “Was working … finished” can work, but the mismatch (“was working” vs. “finish”) is incorrect; if you keep the progressive, make it “was working … and finished.”\\n\\n3) Original: “Running quickly, the finish line seemed far.”\\n   - Edit: “While I was running quickly, the finish line seemed far away.”\\n   - Why: The original has a dangling modifier—“Running quickly” needs to modify “I,” not “the finish line.” Adding “away” is the natural collocation with “far.”\\n\\n4) Original: “The team were excited, we celebrated and it was great.”\\n   - US English edit: “The team was excited. We celebrated, and it was great.”\\n   - UK English edit: “The team were excited. We celebrated, and it was great.”\\n   - Why: Fix the comma splice by splitting into two sentences or using a semicolon. In US English, “team” is treated as singular (“was”); in UK English, plural (“were”). Keeping “it was great” is acceptable, though you could make it more specific (e.g., “and it felt great” or “and it was a rewarding moment”).\\n\\nStructural Suggestions\\n- Consider linking the metaphor (“finish line”) more directly to the project for coherence: e.g., “Even though I was moving quickly to meet the deadline, the ‘finish line’ still felt far away.”\\n- You can combine related ideas for smoother flow: for instance, connect success to the effort and celebration:\\n  - “The results show that I was successful on the project. I worked on the report and finished it yesterday. While I was running quickly, the finish line still seemed far away, but in the end the team was excited. We celebrated, and it felt great.”\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement\\n- Replace vague phrasing like “it was great” with a more specific reflection (e.g., “It felt rewarding to see our hard work pay off”).\\n- Clarify the timeline: if “running quickly” is a metaphor for working toward the deadline, say so explicitly.\\n- Keep tense consistent throughout (past tense for completed actions).\\n\\nFormatting Guidance\\n- For a reflective essay to a teacher, use first person consistently and past tense for completed events.\\n- Aim for paragraph form with clear transitions (e.g., “First,” “Later,” “In the end”).\\n- Avoid comma splices; join independent clauses with a period, semicolon, or a coordinating conjunction with a comma.\\n\\nWould you like me to produce a clean, edited version now? I can provide:\\n- US English version\\n- UK English version\\n- Minimal changes vs. slightly more polished for clarity\\n\\nIf you confirm your preference, I’ll rewrite the paragraph accordingly.\",\n    \"metrics\": {\n      \"groundtruth-eval with azure:o4-mini_2025-04-16\": {\n        \"content\": \"{\\\"score\\\":85,\\\"explanation\\\":\\\"Incorrect headings for Overview and Grammar\\\"}\",\n        \"score\": 85\n      }\n    },\n    \"compliance\": \"ok\",\n    \"complianceText\": \"Provided clear overview, line-by-line edits, categories, constructive tone—complies with description.  \\nOK\",\n    \"isGroundtruth\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"bcb93b2\",\n    \"promptid\": \"b7651b1\",\n    \"ruleid\": 7,\n    \"rule\": \"Every suggested change in the output must be accompanied by a concise explanation that names the issue type (for example, spelling, grammar, tense consistency, dialect, style, clarity, concision, tone, structure, or formatting) and states the rationale for the change.\",\n    \"inverse\": false,\n    \"testuid\": \"test-31489877\",\n    \"scenario\": \"\",\n    \"baseline\": false,\n    \"testinput\": \"goal: comprehensive improvements type: analytical essay audience: classmates feedback: thorough edits text: The experiment was sucssesful but kind of messy.

To make your narrative essay consistent, I can standardize tense and tone, explain each change line by line, and suggest structural and formatting improvements.\\n\\nBefore I proceed, two quick questions to tailor the edit:\\n- Tense preference: Would you like the whole piece in simple past (because the event happened “yesterday”) or in vivid present (present-tense storytelling)? I can do either, but simple past is most typical for this kind of narrative.\\n- Tone preference: Would you like a neutral, semi-formal tone or a more casual, conversational tone? Given your audience (“general readers”), semi-formal/neutral is often best.\\n\\nOverview of editorial guidance:\\n- Choose a single dominant tense (recommendation: simple past) and make all verbs align.\\n- Unify tone by removing slang and using clear, neutral wording.\\n- Smooth out sentence structure (replace the semicolon with a period, clarify pronouns like “it,” and maintain parallel verb forms).\\n- Keep evaluation of your writing (comments about structure/style) in the same tense for consistency, unless you want a deliberate contrast.\\n\\nLine-by-line edits with reasons:\\n1) Original: “Yesterday I walk to the beach and I am watching the waves; later I will wrote about it.”\\n   Edit: “Yesterday, I walked to the beach and watched the waves. Later, I planned to write about the experience.”\\n   Why:\\n   - “walk” → “walked” and “am watching” → “watched” to align with simple past (“Yesterday” sets the timeline).\\n   - Replace the semicolon with a period for clarity and flow.\\n   - “will wrote” is ungrammatical; “planned to write” matches past time and reads smoothly.\\n   - “it” is vague; “the experience” is clearer for readers.\\n\\n2) Original: “I'm gonna add more details because it felt awesome, but the structure is all over the place and I start with the ending.”\\n   Edit: “I intended to add more details because it felt wonderful, but the structure was all over the place, and I started with the ending.”\\n   Why:\\n   - “I’m gonna” → “I intended to” to standardize tone (semi-formal) and tense (past).\\n   - “awesome” → “wonderful” for a neutral tone suitable for general readers.\\n   - “is” → “was” and “start” → “started” to maintain past tense.\\n   - Add a comma before “and” to separate independent clauses and improve readability.\\n\\n3) Original: “The style switches between casual and formal.”\\n   Edit: “The style shifted between casual and formal.”\\n   Why:\\n   - “switches” → “shifted” to keep past tense consistent.\\n   - Keeps your point while aligning tone and tense with the rest.\\n\\nCategorized feedback:\\n\\nOverall Feedback:\\n- The main issue is inconsistent tense (present, future, and past mixed) and shifting tone (slang vs. formal). Choosing simple past and a neutral, semi-formal voice will make the narrative clear and cohesive for general readers.\\n- Clarify vague references (like “it”) and avoid unnecessary punctuation complexity for short, straightforward sentences.\\n\\nSpelling Edits:\\n- “gonna” → “going to” (or, better here, “intended to”) because “gonna” is colloquial and not ideal for a general-audience essay.\\n- No other spelling errors found.\\n\\nGrammar Edits:\\n- Tense standardization: change “walk,” “am watching,” “will wrote,” “is,” “start,” “switches” to past forms (“walked,” “watched,” “planned to write,” “was,” “started,” “shifted”).\\n- Verb form correction: “will wrote” is incorrect. Use “planned to write” or “would write” (future-in-the-past).\\n- Punctuation: Replace the semicolon with a period for clarity; add a comma before “and” when joining independent clauses.\\n\\nStructural Suggestions:\\n- If your essay “starts with the ending,” decide if that’s intentional (a hook) or accidental. If intentional, signal it clearly: for example, begin with a brief reflection and then transition to the chronological story.\\n- Otherwise, consider chronological order: open with arriving at the beach, describe sensory details (sight, sound, feeling), then conclude with your plan to write about it and what you learned.\\n- Clarify “the experience” rather than “it,” and add one or two concrete sensory images to anchor the narrative.\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement:\\n- Add specific details to elevate style: mention the color/texture of the waves, the wind, the scent of salt, or how the water’s rhythm affected your mood.\\n- Replace general adjectives (“wonderful”) with precise ones that match your experience (“calming,” “invigorating,” “overwhelming”).\\n- Consider a brief reflective sentence at the end tying the experience to why you wanted to write about it.\\n\\nFormatting Guidance:\\n- Use short, clear paragraphs. For a brief narrative: 1) arrival and first impressions; 2) watching the waves; 3) reflection and writing intention.\\n- Avoid excessive semicolons in simple narrative prose. Use periods and commas to keep rhythm steady.\\n- Keep consistent voice throughout; if you include meta-remarks about your structure, keep them in the same tense as the narrative or set them off as a separate paragraph.\\n\\nWould you like me to apply these changes and generate a clean, edited version in:\\n- Simple past, semi-formal tone; or\\n- Present tense (for vivid immediacy), semi-formal tone?\\n\\nIf you prefer, I can provide both versions so you can choose.\",\n    \"metrics\": {\n      \"groundtruth-eval with azure:o4-mini_2025-04-16\": {\n        \"content\": \"{\\\"score\\\":60,\\\"explanation\\\":\\\"Missing exact “Overview” heading and misuses bullet rules\\\"}\",\n        \"score\": 60\n      }\n    },\n    \"compliance\": \"ok\",\n    \"complianceText\": \"Meets the required structure: asks questions, overview, line-by-line edits, categorized feedback, and offers final edit.  \\nOK\",\n    \"isGroundtruth\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"d74a393\",\n    \"promptid\": \"b7651b1\",\n    \"ruleid\": 9,\n    \"rule\": \"The “Structural Suggestions” section must provide concrete recommendations for reordering, combining, expanding, or trimming parts of the writing, and each recommendation must include an explanation of how it improves coherence, flow, or argument.\",\n    \"inverse\": false,\n    \"testuid\": \"test-10155443\",\n    \"scenario\": \"\",\n    \"baseline\": false,\n    \"testinput\": \"goal: improve organization type: research summary audience: instructor feedback: structural suggestions text: paragraph1: The results section lists three key findings, then I introduce my research question. paragraph2: Background information appears after the conclusion, and some duplicated points appear in both sections. paragraph3: Methods are briefly mentioned at the end, although they should be earlier.\",\n    \"model\": \"gpt-5-2025-08-07\",\n    \"input\": \"goal: improve organization type: research summary audience: instructor feedback: structural suggestions text: paragraph1: The results section lists three key findings, then I introduce my research question. paragraph2: Background information appears after the conclusion, and some duplicated points appear in both sections. paragraph3: Methods are briefly mentioned at the end, although they should be earlier.\",\n    \"output\": \"Quick questions so I tailor the edit:\\n- Do you have a required word count or section headings for this research summary?\\n- Are you using a specific citation style (APA, MLA, Chicago)?\\n- Does your instructor require particular sections (e.g., Research Question, Background, Methods, Results, Conclusion), or is the structure flexible?\\n\\nOverview of my approach:\\n- Because this is a research summary for an instructor, I’ll prioritize clarity, logical flow, and standard academic ordering: Research Question → Background → Methods → Results → Discussion/Conclusion.\\n- I’ll give line-by-line edits to the three sentences you shared and explain the reasoning.\\n- I’ll provide structural suggestions to eliminate duplication, fix section order, and improve transitions.\\n- I’ll finish with formatting guidance typical for a short research summary and offer to rewrite the piece.\\n\\nOverall Feedback:\\n- Main issue is section order: the research question should come before results, background should not follow the conclusion, and methods should precede results.\\n- Remove duplication between background and conclusion; each section should have a distinct purpose (context vs. synthesis/implications).\\n- Use consistent tense: past tense for methods and results, present tense for the research question and general claims.\\n- Prefer clear signposting (topic sentences and headings) and avoid informal sequencing phrases like “then.”\\n\\nSpelling Edits:\\n- No spelling errors in the three sentences.

Keep data accurate and sourced.\\n- Use one short, human-centered vignette: A senior finding respite on a shaded bench; kids safely playing close to home; a weekend market energizing a pocket park.\\n- Include at least two data points: For credibility, attribute inline (“according to the Trust for Public Land,” “city budget reports,” “CDC”).\\n- Incorporate a local map or figure (if the paper allows): “Half our households live more than a 10‑minute walk from a park.”\\n- Propose realistic funding: Grants (state environmental funds), corporate sponsorships for amenities, tree-planting programs, developer impact fees, modest bond measures.\\n- Name partners: Parks department, local schools, youth sports leagues, health nonprofits, neighborhood associations.\\n\\nFormatting Guidance\\n- Title/headline: Make it specific and benefit-driven (“Parks Are Smart Infrastructure—Our City Should Fund Them Now”).\\n- Lede: 1–2 sentences, vivid and local.\\n- Length: 600–800 words; short paragraphs; avoid footnotes. Cite sources in-text (“according to…”). No academic citation formats.\\n- Tone: Civic-minded, solutions-oriented, respectful. Avoid jargon; define any necessary terms (e.g., “urban heat island”).\\n- Transitions: Use bridge phrases between sections:\\n  - “Beyond the economic gains, parks improve public health.”\\n  - “Equally important is resilience.”\\n  - “Critics worry about costs; however…”\\n  - “Ultimately, investment is both prudent and overdue.”\\n- Ending: A concrete action (vote, email council, attend hearing) and a timeframe.\\n\\nWould you like further assistance?\\n- If you share your city and preferred word count, I can draft a full op‑ed incorporating local context, transitional sentences, data placeholders, and a consistent tone.\\n- I can also provide a paragraph-by-paragraph template you can fill with local facts.\\n\\nOffer to generate the edited text\\n- I can rewrite your piece now.

Before I dive in, a couple of quick questions so I can tailor the feedback:\\n- Who is your target audience (teacher, classmates, school board, principal)?\\n- Do you have a word-count requirement or a rubric (e.g., thesis, evidence, counterargument)?\\n- Do you need to include any sources or data?\\n\\nOverview of how I’ll help:\\n- I’ll provide line-by-line edits that correct grammar and clarify meaning while keeping your voice.\\n- I’ll explain each change and why it improves the sentence.\\n- I’ll give structural suggestions to turn this into a persuasive essay with a strong thesis, supporting points, and a call to action.\\n- I’ll offer formatting guidance and, if you want, write a revised version that incorporates all improvements.\\n\\nLine-by-line edits with explanations:\\n1) Original: “School lunches is healthy but they taste bad and students is complaining.”\\n   Edited: “School lunches are healthy, but they often taste bad, and many students are complaining.”\\n   Why:\\n   - Subject–verb agreement: “lunches” is plural, so use “are,” not “is.”\\n   - Add “often” to avoid an absolute claim and sound more reasonable.\\n   - Add “many” to avoid overgeneralization and be more precise.\\n   - Commas: place a comma after the introductory clause to improve readability (“are healthy, but…”).\\n   - Parallel clarity: “students are complaining” matches the plural subject and reads smoothly.\\n   Optional stronger wording for a more academic tone: “School lunches are intended to be healthy, but they are often unappetizing, and many students complain.”\\n\\n2) Original: “I think the policy should change though I don't know how.”\\n   Edited (basic correction): “I think the policy should change, though I’m not sure how.”\\n   Why:\\n   - Comma before “though” to separate clauses.\\n   - Contraction “I’m” improves flow; “not sure” is more natural than “don’t know.”\\n   Stronger persuasive alternative (recommended): “The district should revise the lunch policy to balance nutrition with taste and increase student satisfaction.”\\n   Why:\\n   - Replaces uncertainty with a clear thesis claim (better for persuasion).\\n   - Specifies the goal (balance nutrition and taste, increase satisfaction).\\n\\nOverall feedback:\\n- Your central idea is clear: lunches may be healthy but taste poor, and that causes complaints. For persuasion, turn this into a firm thesis and propose concrete solutions.\\n- Avoid uncertainty (“I don’t know how”); instead, present actionable recommendations.\\n- Strengthen tone by using precise, academic vocabulary (e.g., “unappetizing,” “revise the policy,” “increase participation,” “reduce waste”).\\n\\nSpelling edits:\\n- No spelling errors present.\\n- Style note: “taste bad” is acceptable because “taste” is a linking verb and takes an adjective (“bad”). If you want a more formal tone, consider “taste poor” or “are unappetizing.”\\n\\nGrammar edits:\\n- Subject–verb agreement: “School lunches is” → “School lunches are.”\\n- Subject–verb agreement: “students is complaining” → “students are complaining.”\\n- Comma usage: Add a comma before “but” and before “though” to correctly join independent clauses.\\n- Precision: Add modifiers like “often” or “many” to avoid absolute generalizations.\\n\\nStructural suggestions:\\n- Use a clear five-part structure:\\n  1) Introduction: Hook (e.g., a short observation about students throwing away food), context (health goals), and thesis (policy should balance nutrition and taste).\\n  2) Body paragraph 1: Why taste matters (participation rates, reduced waste, better energy and focus).\\n  3) Body paragraph 2: Proposed solutions (student taste-tests, seasoning stations, more fresh options, culturally diverse menus, feedback surveys).\\n  4) Body paragraph 3 (counterargument): Address constraints (USDA guidelines, budget) and show feasible ways to comply (work with a nutritionist, pilot recipes within guidelines, negotiate vendor pricing).\\n  5) Conclusion: Call to action (ask the school board to run a pilot, create a student advisory committee, timeline).\\n- Use topic sentences and transitions (“Furthermore,” “However,” “As a result,” “To address these concerns…”).\\n\\nOpportunities for improvement:\\n- Add evidence: brief data (e.g., “In a recent student survey, 62% reported throwing away parts of their lunch”), observations, or quotes from peers.\\n- Define success metrics: participation rates, food waste reduction, student satisfaction surveys.\\n- Make recommendations concrete: “Introduce monthly taste-tests,” “Offer a seasoning bar (herbs, lemon, low-sodium options),” “Pilot three new recipes per quarter.”\\n\\nFormatting guidance:\\n- If this is a standard high-school persuasive essay:\\n  - Include a clear title (e.g., “Balancing Nutrition and Taste in School Lunches”).\\n  - Use an introduction with a thesis at the end of the first paragraph.\\n  - Double-space, 12-point Times New Roman, 1-inch margins.\\n  - If citing sources or data, follow your class’s required style (MLA/APA) with in-text citations and a Works Cited/References page.\\n- If it’s a letter to the school board, use a proper salutation, concise paragraphs, and a polite call to action.\\n\\nWould you like me to:\\n- Expand this into a full persuasive paragraph or a 5-paragraph essay using the stronger thesis?\\n- Incorporate specific evidence if you have any survey results or observations?\\n\\nIf helpful, here’s a concise revised version of your two sentences with a stronger persuasive tone:\\n“School lunches are intended to be healthy, but they often taste unappetizing, and many students are complaining.

Before I dive in, a couple quick questions so I can tailor the edits:\\n- About how long do you want the speech to be (e.g., 1–2 minutes, 3–5 minutes)?\\n- What tone are you aiming for: collaborative and solution-focused, or more urgent and assertive?\\n- Do you want to propose any specific actions (e.g., homework guidelines, no-homework nights, coordination across departments)?\\n\\nOverview of the editorial guidance I’ll provide\\n- Make the statement clear, respectful, and persuasive for teachers and a principal.\\n- Fix grammar and sentence structure (comma splice, subject–verb agreement).\\n- Strengthen word choice to avoid overly negative phrasing (“complaining”) and emphasize shared goals.\\n- Offer a simple outline and concrete, audience-aware proposals you could include.\\n\\nOverall Feedback\\n- Audience alignment: Since you’re persuading teachers and the principal, use collaborative language that recognizes their professional expertise and shared commitment to student learning. Replace “complaining” with “expressing concerns” or “reporting challenges.”\\n- Clarity and purpose: State your thesis succinctly: homework supports learning, but it should be balanced and purposeful. Then quickly define what “balance” means (e.g., reasonable limits, coordination, quality over quantity).\\n- Solution-focused approach: Move beyond the problem to propose practical, actionable steps the committee can adopt. Emphasize benefits for teachers (better completion quality, fewer burnout-related issues, more meaningful class time).\\n- Structure: Use a clear speech flow—acknowledge concerns, present evidence or observations, propose solutions, invite collaboration, and end with a respectful call to action.\\n\\nSpelling Edits\\n- “we needs” → “we need”\\n  - Explanation: Subject–verb agreement; “we” takes the base form “need.”\\n\\nGrammar Edits\\n- Comma splice: “Students are complaining about too much homework, I argue…” joins two independent clauses with a comma.\\n  - Fix with a conjunction or punctuation:\\n    - “…too much homework, and I argue…”\\n    - “…too much homework; I argue…”\\n    - Or split into two sentences.\\n- Word order and parallelism: “but also we needs balance” is awkward and ungrammatical.\\n  - Smoother: “but we also need balance.”\\n- Tone refinement (not grammar but important for audience): “complaining” can sound dismissive. Prefer “expressing concerns” or “reporting that the workload feels heavy.”\\n\\nStructural Suggestions\\n- Suggested outline for a short persuasive speech:\\n  1. Opening: Acknowledge shared goals (student learning, skill-building) and the role of homework.\\n  2. Problem statement: Students are reporting that the volume/timing of homework can feel overwhelming, which impacts well-being and quality of learning.\\n  3. Evidence/observations: Briefly reference observations, survey data, or examples (e.g., overlapping due dates across departments).\\n  4. Proposal: Define “balance” and offer concrete steps (reasonable time estimates, coordination, purposeful assignments).\\n  5. Benefits: Explain how these steps improve outcomes for students and teachers (better engagement, higher-quality work).\\n  6. Call to action: Invite the committee to pilot guidelines or form a working group.\\n- Keep paragraphs short and use transitions (“First,” “In addition,” “Therefore”) to guide listeners.\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement\\n- Define “necessary”: Specify why homework matters (practice, reinforcement, self-management).\\n- Define “balance”: Offer specifics (e.g., weekly time caps by grade level, no-homework nights before major tests, coordination across departments to avoid stacking, focus on quality over quantity).\\n- Include one brief anecdote or data point to humanize the issue.\\n- Anticipate objections: Acknowledge that some practice is essential and propose flexible approaches (e.g., optional challenge problems, choice in assignments).\\n- Use rhetorical strategies: Parallel structure (“Purposeful, proportional, and predictable”), a concise triad, and a clear call to action.\\n\\nFormatting Guidance\\n- For a spoken draft:\\n  - Use short sentences and line breaks where you want pauses.\\n  - Add transitions to signpost your points.\\n  - Emphasize key phrases by placing them at the end of sentences for impact.\\n  - Aim for 1–3 minutes depending on meeting constraints; practice out loud to adjust pacing.\\n\\nLine-by-line edits of your sentence\\n- Original: “Students are complaining about too much homework, I argue that homework is necessary but also we needs balance.”\\n- Edited (basic fix, formal tone):\\n  - “Many students are expressing concerns about the amount of homework, and I argue that homework is necessary, but we also need balance.”\\n  - Reasoning: Replaces “complaining” with “expressing concerns” (respectful); fixes comma splice with “and”; adds a comma before “but” for readability; corrects “we needs” to “we need.”\\n- Edited (more persuasive and audience-aware):\\n  - “Many students have reported that the volume of homework can feel overwhelming. Homework is essential for learning, and we can strengthen its impact by ensuring a better balance.”\\n  - Reasoning: Splits into two sentences to improve clarity; adds purpose (“essential for learning”); reframes “balance” as improving impact, which aligns with educator goals.\\n- Edited (concise thesis statement):\\n  - “Homework is essential, but it works best when it is purposeful, proportional, and coordinated.”\\n  - Reasoning: Tight triad provides a clear, memorable standard.\\n\\nWould you like me to generate the edited speech?\\n- I can expand this into a 1–2 minute speech tailored to your audience with specific proposals and a respectful call to action.

Choose one tense based on your context.\\n- Incorrect past tense: “buyed”\\n  - Corrected: “bought”\\n  - Explanation: Irregular verbs don’t follow the “-ed” rule; “buy” becomes “bought” in the past.\\n- Subject–verb agreement: “apples that is fresh”\\n  - Corrected: “apples that are fresh”\\n  - Streamlined alternative: “fresh apples”\\n  - Explanation: “Apples” is plural, so use “are.” Often, turning the clause into an adjective (“fresh apples”) is clearer.\\n- Comma usage and run-on structure: “I was going, then I go to the store, and buyed…”\\n  - Corrected (past): “I went to the store and bought fresh apples.”\\n  - Corrected (present): “I am going to the store to buy fresh apples.”\\n  - Explanation: The original has comma splices and choppy coordination. Use one main clause with a coordinated verb phrase for a smooth sentence.\\n\\nStructural Suggestions:\\n- Decide the timeline and simplify:\\n  - Past tense (most natural for recounting): “I went to the store and bought fresh apples.”\\n  - Present/progressive (planning or current action): “I am going to the store to buy fresh apples.”\\n- If you meant intention rather than movement, use “going to” + verb:\\n  - “I was going to go to the store and buy fresh apples,” or more concise, “I was going to buy fresh apples at the store.”\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement:\\n- Minimize redundancy: If you use “went,” you don’t need “then.”\\n- Prefer precise vocabulary: “fresh apples” is cleaner than “apples that are fresh.”\\n\\nFormatting Guidance:\\n- For a single-sentence update, keep it to one clear line in consistent tense.\\n- If part of a larger paragraph, ensure surrounding sentences use the same tense unless there’s a clear reason to shift.\\n\\nWould you like me to:\\n- Choose the best version based on your intended tense?\\n- Expand the sentence with a bit more detail or style?\\n\\nIf you’d like, I can generate the edited sentence now.

To make it read smoothly, fix the grammar and consider splitting it into two sentences or using a semicolon for clarity.\\n- Adjust article usage (“an” before “astronaut”), verb forms (“dreams,” “become”), and word order (“maybe” placement).\\n- Consider specificity later (e.g., why he dreams, what sparks it), but for an opener, clarity is key.\\n\\nSpelling Edits:\\n- astronaut: spelled correctly. No spelling errors in the current line.\\n- became → become: not a spelling issue; this is a verb form/tense correction (see Grammar).\\n\\nGrammar Edits:\\n- “who are dreams” → “who dreams”\\n  - Issue type: Subject–verb agreement and unnecessary auxiliary.\\n  - Rationale: “boy” is singular, so use “dreams.” The structure “who dreams” is correct; “are” is not needed.\\n- “a astronaut” → “an astronaut”\\n  - Issue type: Article usage.\\n  - Rationale: Use “an” before words starting with a vowel sound.\\n- “he maybe will became one someday” → “maybe he will become one someday” or “he may become one someday”\\n  - Issue type: Word order, modality, and verb tense/form.\\n  - Rationale: “Maybe” usually comes at the beginning of the clause or before the subject; “will become” (future) or “may become” (possibility) are correct. “Became” is past tense and doesn’t fit with “will.”\\n- Comma after “astronaut”:\\n  - Issue type: Punctuation/structure.\\n  - Rationale: A comma here creates a run-on feel. Better to split into two sentences or use a semicolon.\\n\\nStructural Suggestions:\\n- Option 1 (two sentences for clarity): “My story begins with a boy who dreams of becoming an astronaut.

If you paste the full draft, I can give line-by-line edits across the whole piece.\\n\\nOverall Feedback\\n- Your core claim (“climate change is real”) needs support from credible sources and specific data to be persuasive. Readers expect evidence, definitions, and clear reasoning.\\n- Paragraphs should each focus on a single idea with a topic sentence, evidence, and analysis. Choppiness often comes from abrupt transitions, mixed ideas in one paragraph, or insufficient explanation between claims.\\n- Maintain a clear, neutral, and evidence-driven tone. Avoid overly emotional language; prioritize accuracy, citations, and logic.\\n\\nSpelling Edits\\n- “The argument say” should be “The argument says.” Reason: subject-verb agreement; “argument” (singular) takes “says.”\\n- No spelling errors in the provided sentence, but watch for common climate-related terms:\\n  - “greenhouse gases” (two words)\\n  - “carbon dioxide” (not “carbon di-oxide”)\\n  - “Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)” capitalization and acronym\\n  - “peer-reviewed” hyphenation\\n\\nGrammar Edits\\n- Original: “The argument say climate change is real but I don’t provide any data and the paragraphs is choppy.”\\n  - Edit: “The argument says climate change is real, but I don’t provide any data, and the paragraphs are choppy.”\\n  - Reasons:\\n    - Subject-verb agreement: “argument says”\\n    - Commas for compound sentence and clarity before “but” and to separate clauses\\n    - Plural verb for “paragraphs are”\\n    - Parallel structure: align verb forms (“is real,” “don’t provide,” “are choppy”)\\n- Use consistent tense. In analytical essays, present tense is common (“Research shows…,” “This evidence indicates…”).\\n- Prefer active voice for clarity: “The data show…” instead of “It is shown by data…”\\n\\nStructural Suggestions\\n- Use a clear structure:\\n  - Introduction: define climate change briefly, present your thesis (“Climate change is real because X, Y, and Z”), and preview main points.\\n  - Body paragraph 1: Physical evidence (global temperature rise, ice melt). Include one or two specific data points.\\n  - Body paragraph 2: Mechanism (greenhouse effect, CO2 trends). Explain cause-and-effect with sources.\\n  - Body paragraph 3: Impacts (sea-level rise, extreme weather). Use recent examples and studies.\\n  - Body paragraph 4 (optional): Address a counterargument (e.g., natural variability) and refute with evidence.\\n  - Conclusion: restate thesis, synthesize insights, and end with implications or a call to informed understanding.\\n- Within each paragraph:\\n  - Topic sentence stating the claim.\\n  - Evidence (data, studies) with citation.\\n  - Analysis linking evidence to your claim (“This matters because…”).\\n  - Concluding sentence that transitions to the next paragraph.\\n- Add signpost transitions:\\n  - Between paragraphs: “First,” “Additionally,” “In contrast,” “Moreover,” “Consequently.”\\n  - Within paragraphs: “For example,” “Specifically,” “This suggests,” “As a result.”\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement\\n- Clarity: Define key terms (e.g., “climate change,” “greenhouse gases,” “anomaly”) the first time you use them. Avoid vague phrases like “scientists say” and specify sources.\\n- Evidence: Incorporate reputable data (e.g., IPCC Assessment Reports, NASA GISS temperature records, NOAA sea-level trends, peer-reviewed studies). Include numbers with dates and units. Example: “Global mean surface temperature has increased by approximately 1.1°C since the late 19th century (IPCC, 2023).”\\n- Examples: Use concrete, recent case studies to illustrate trends (e.g., “The 2023 Canadian wildfires released X megatonnes of CO2,” or “Arctic sea ice extent has declined by ~13% per decade since 1979.”).\\n- Transitions: Bridge your ideas with signposting and summary sentences to avoid choppiness. End each paragraph by linking back to the thesis and foreshadowing the next point.\\n- Tone: Aim for measured, objective language. Replace emotionally charged wording with precise, sourced statements.

I can help strengthen your thesis, improve flow, and fix grammar/tense issues while keeping your voice and MLA expectations in mind.\\n\\nBefore I begin, a couple of quick clarifying questions:\\n- Are you okay with removing phrases like “I think” to make the thesis more assertive, or do you prefer to keep first-person throughout?\\n- Would you like to avoid contractions (e.g., “don’t” → “do not”) for a more formal tone?\\n- Is “Turkle” referring to Sherry Turkle? If so, I’ll keep the in-text citation as-is and include a Works Cited placeholder.\\n\\nOverview of the editorial approach:\\n- Strengthen the thesis into a clear, concise claim early in the paragraph.\\n- Smooth transitions and tighten sentences for better flow.\\n- Correct grammar (subject-verb agreement, pronouns, punctuation) and maintain consistent present tense where appropriate.\\n- Align with MLA style: in-text citation placement, formal tone suggestions, and a Works Cited placeholder.\\n\\nLine-by-line edits with reasoning:\\n1) Original: “In todays world, social media are making people more connected but also more apart.”\\n   Suggested: “In today’s world, social media is making people more connected but also more isolated.”\\n   Reasoning:\\n   - “todays” needs an apostrophe: “today’s.”\\n   - “social media” is usually treated as a singular mass noun: use “is,” not “are.”\\n   - “more apart” is awkward; “more isolated” is clearer and more academic.\\n\\n2) Original: “I think that while it helps us communicate, it also make us lonely, because we are scrolling instead of seeing each other.”\\n   Suggested: “While it helps us communicate, it also makes us lonely because we scroll instead of seeing each other.”\\n   Reasoning:\\n   - Remove “I think that” to strengthen the claim (thesis becomes more assertive).\\n   - Subject-verb agreement: “makes,” not “make.”\\n   - General statements in academic writing usually use simple present (“we scroll”), not present progressive (“we are scrolling”).\\n   - The comma before “because” is unnecessary; removing it tightens the sentence.\\n\\n3) Original: “For example, I text my friends daily but I dont see them on weekend, which used to be normal before.”\\n   Suggested: “For example, I text my friends daily, but I do not see them on weekends, even though hanging out used to be normal.”\\n   Reasoning:\\n   - Add comma before “but” to separate independent clauses.\\n   - “dont” needs an apostrophe: “do not” (or “don’t,” but “do not” is more formal).\\n   - “weekend” should be plural (“weekends”) to match the general habit.\\n   - “which used to be normal before” is redundant and awkward; “used to be normal” is sufficient. “Hanging out” clarifies what was normal.\\n\\n4) Original: “This topic is very important because people are getting worse attention span and that affects school.”\\n   Suggested: “This topic is important because people’s attention spans are getting worse, and that affects their performance in school.”\\n   Reasoning:\\n   - “attention span” should be plural (“attention spans”) or rephrased.\\n   - “people are getting worse attention span” is awkward; rephrase for clarity.\\n   - Specify “their performance in school” to make the impact clearer and more academic.\\n   - Consider dropping “very” for a more formal tone.\\n\\n5) Original: “Some people says social media is just a tool and it depends how you use it, but I think the whole design is addictive. (Turkle 45)”\\n   Suggested: “Some people say social media is just a tool and that it depends on how people use it, but its design is addictive (Turkle 45).”\\n   Reasoning:\\n   - Subject-verb agreement: “say,” not “says.”\\n   - Add “that” for parallel structure and clarity.\\n   - Avoid second-person “you” in academic writing; use “people.”\\n   - In MLA, place the period after the parenthetical citation: “…addictive (Turkle 45).”\\n\\nOverall Feedback:\\n- Your central idea is strong: social media both connects and isolates us. Tightening the thesis and removing hedging (“I think”) will make your argument more persuasive.\\n- The flow improves when you use consistent present tense, avoid second-person “you,” and connect examples directly to your claim.\\n- Word choice like “isolated,” “performance,” and “addictive design” strengthens academic tone without losing your voice.\\n\\nSpelling Edits:\\n- “todays” → “today’s” (apostrophe shows possession).\\n- “dont” → “do not” (or “don’t” if you prefer; “do not” is more formal).\\n\\nGrammar Edits:\\n- Treat “social media” as singular: “social media is,” not “are.”\\n- Subject-verb agreement: “makes,” not “make.”\\n- Pluralize general habits: “on weekends,” not “on weekend.”\\n- Comma usage: Add comma before “but” when joining independent clauses; remove comma before “because” unless needed for clarity.\\n- Pronoun consistency: Avoid second-person “you” in academic writing; use “people” or “we.”\\n- Place MLA citation before the period: “…addictive (Turkle 45).”\\n\\nStructural Suggestions:\\n- Put a clear thesis early, ideally as the first or second sentence. For example: “Although social media helps us communicate, its addictive design makes us lonelier and weakens our attention, which harms our real-world relationships and school performance.”\\n- Keep one example per paragraph and tie it back to the thesis explicitly (e.g., explain how weekend habits reflect isolation and attention issues).\\n- Consider ending the paragraph with a sentence that previews the next point or reinforces your claim (a mini-conclusion).\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement:\\n- Add a brief transition from your example back to the broader impact (e.g., “This pattern shows how digital connection can replace in-person time.”).\\n- If you’ll include more evidence later, think about varying examples (school focus, relationships, mental health) while staying within your assignment’s scope.\\n- Consider a signal phrase for the source: “As Turkle argues, social media’s design encourages addictive behavior (45).” This integrates the citation smoothly.\\n\\nFormatting Guidance (MLA):\\n- In-text citations: Place the parenthetical citation before the period: “…addictive (Turkle 45).”\\n- Maintain double-spacing, 1-inch margins, Times New Roman 12 pt, and a running header with your last name and page number.\\n- First page header: Your Name, Teacher’s Name, Course, Date (Day Month Year), then centered essay title, then your text.\\n- Works Cited: Include a placeholder entry for Turkle.

I’ll keep your reflective, slightly whimsical voice and first-person perspective intact while focusing on tense consistency, clarity, dialogue punctuation, pacing, and show-vs.-tell. Before I dive in, two quick questions so I can tailor the edits:\\n- Do you want the piece to read in past tense or present tense? Because you mention “last night,” past tense is the most consistent choice; I can also adjust the time marker if you prefer present tense immediacy.\\n- Any word count or submission requirements from the magazine (font, margins, etc.), beyond standard manuscript format?\\n\\nOverview of what I’ll do:\\n- Make all verbs consistent in one tense (recommend past tense to match “last night”).\\n- Tighten descriptions for clarity while preserving your imagery and tone.\\n- Correct dialogue punctuation and adjust sentence boundaries for rhythm and pacing.\\n- Offer show-vs.-tell upgrades through small sensory details and interior beats.\\n- Provide structural and formatting guidance for a clean submission.\\n\\nOverall Feedback\\n- Your opening immediately establishes mood with “buzzing like a hive” and the quirky, secret-knowing whale—great voice. The main issues are tense shifts (present to past and back), a few unclear or repetitive verbs, and one long sentence that would land better if split. With consistent tense and a few rhythm tweaks, the scene will feel polished and vivid.\\n\\nSpelling Edits\\n- No spelling errors detected.\\n- Small word choice polish recommended:\\n  - “empty place” → “empty arcade” for specificity and clarity.\\n\\nGrammar Edits (line-by-line with proposed revisions and reasoning)\\n- Original: “I walk into the old arcade last night and the lights were buzzing like a hive.”\\n  - Proposed: “I walked into the old arcade last night, and the lights buzzed like a hive.”\\n  - Why: Aligns tense with “last night” (walk → walked; were buzzing → buzzed), improves flow with a comma to join independent clauses, and pares “were buzzing” to “buzzed” for tighter prose.\\n\\n- Original: “The air smells of dust and coins.”\\n  - Proposed: “The air smelled of dust and coins.”\\n  - Why: Past tense consistency (smells → smelled). “Of” is fine; the phrase is concise and evocative.\\n\\n- Original: “You coming?” Jay says, but I was already at the claw machine, staring at a plush whale that looks at me like it knows a secret.\\n  - Proposed Option A (clean and concise): “You coming?” Jay said, but I was already at the claw machine, staring at a plush whale that looked at me like it knew a secret.\\n  - Proposed Option B (stronger pacing): “You coming?” Jay said. I was already at the claw machine, staring at a plush whale that looked at me like it knew a secret.\\n  - Why: Past tense consistency (says → said; looks → looked; knows → knew). Option B splits the long sentence, creating a clearer beat that shows your focus shifting from Jay to the whale.\\n\\n- Original: “I drop the token. It clatters.”\\n  - Proposed: “I dropped the token. It clattered.”\\n  - Why: Past tense consistency (drop → dropped; clatters → clattered). The short, paired sentences keep a nice staccato rhythm.\\n\\n- Original: “I am thinking this is silly and then the claw was moving and my heart thumped.”\\n  - Proposed Option A: “I thought it was silly, and then the claw moved and my heart thumped.”\\n  - Proposed Option B (smoother cause-effect): “I thought it was silly until the claw moved and my heart thumped.”\\n  - Why: Past tense consistency (am thinking → thought; was moving → moved). Option B tightens the causal turn—your feeling changes when the claw moves.\\n\\n- Original: “The whale slips, then it slip again and I laugh, but it sounded too loud in the empty place.”\\n  - Proposed Option A: “The whale slipped, then slipped again, and I laughed, but the sound was too loud in the empty arcade.”\\n  - Proposed Option B (pacing with emphasis): “The whale slipped—then slipped again—and I laughed, but the sound was too loud in the empty arcade.”\\n  - Why: Past tense consistency (slips/slip → slipped), parallel structure for “slipped,” and clarity (“empty place” → “empty arcade”). Option B uses em dashes to mimic the stuttering motion of the claw for vivid pacing.\\n\\nStructural Suggestions\\n- Consider splitting the sentence with Jay’s dialogue from your action (Option B above) to emphasize your pull toward the whale and create a cleaner transition.\\n- Use a brief interior beat after “It clattered” to show your anticipation or self-consciousness (e.g., “I pretended not to care, but my fingers hovered near the joystick”). This adds texture without changing plot beats.\\n- The final sentence is carrying several actions; using em dashes or a period can distribute emphasis and make the scene feel more dynamic.\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement (show vs. tell and pacing)\\n- Show the arcade’s emptiness with a sensory detail: the soundtrack loop barely audible, a sticky spot under your shoe, or the flicker of a half-dead neon letter. This replaces “empty place” with concrete atmosphere.\\n- Give us a reflective beat that matches the whimsical tone when you see the whale: one line of internal narration connects your fascination to why it “knows a secret,” e.g., “It had the sleepy smile of someone who’s already won.”\\n- Vary sentence lengths: keep your short, punchy lines (“It clattered.”), but let one or two longer sentences carry mood. You already do this—just tighten the long ones to avoid run-ons.\\n\\nFormatting Guidance (standard manuscript)\\n- Use 12-point Times New Roman, double-spaced, 1-inch margins, left-aligned, and indent the first line of each paragraph by 0.5 inches.\\n- Include a header with your last name, story title (shortened if needed), and page number on each page (top right).\\n- Dialogue punctuation:\\n  - Keep punctuation inside the quotation marks: “You coming?”\\n  - Use a lower-case dialogue tag if it continues the sentence: “You coming?” Jay said.\\n  - Consider a period and new sentence when shifting focus: “You coming?” Jay said. I was already…\\n\\nWould you like me to generate a fully revised version in past tense (or present, if you prefer), incorporating all the suggested changes and pacing tweaks? I can also add one or two subtle sensory details to deepen the mood while preserving your voice.\\n\\nAnything else you want me to prioritize—word count, submission guidelines, or specific magazine preferences?\",\n    \"metrics\": {\n      \"groundtruth-eval with azure:o4-mini_2025-04-16\": {\n        \"content\": \"{\\\"explanation\\\":\\\"Nonexact headings used\\\",\\\"score\\\":85}\",\n        \"score\": 85\n      }\n    },\n    \"compliance\": \"ok\",\n    \"complianceText\": \"Fits the description’s structure and tone: asks clarifying questions, gives overview, and categorized, line-by-line feedback with reasoning.  \\nOK\",\n    \"isGroundtruth\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"2cbd2d0\",\n    \"promptid\": \"b7651b1\",\n    \"ruleid\": null,\n    \"testuid\": \"baseline-test-0uf79y3zi\",\n    \"scenario\": \"\",\n    \"baseline\": true,\n    \"testinput\": \"goals: Make the tone professional, fix grammar and concision, and improve structure\\ntype_of_writing: complaint email to customer support\\ntarget_audience: electronics retailer customer service\\nfeedback_focus: line-by-line grammar/spelling edits with reasoning; structural suggestions; formatting for a clear, polite email\\nformatting: email format (subject line, greeting, body, call to action, signature)\\ntone_preferences: polite but firm\\nconstraints: keep order number and dates; no exaggerations; keep under 250 words\\ntext: Subject: Issue with damaged monitor order\\nTo whom it may concern,\\nI am writing about my order #A11359 placed on Aug 29.

Before I finalize edits, a couple quick questions to tailor the bullets:\\n- Are these all for a single, current job? If yes, what’s the job title, company, and dates?\\n- Do you have any measurable results (e.g., sales increase %, number of rewards sign-ups, cash drawer accuracy, number of returns processed, inventory shrink reduction)?\\n- What kind of internship are you targeting (e.g., operations, retail management, marketing, finance)? I can prioritize bullets accordingly.\\n- Do you prefer bullets without periods (common for resumes) or with periods? I’ll keep it consistent either way.\\n\\nOverview of the solution\\n- I will strengthen action verbs, enforce parallel structure, and set consistent tense and capitalization.\\n- I’ll give line-by-line edits with reasoning, then propose an optimal order for the bullets.\\n- I’ll include formatting guidance to meet resume standards and ask for any metrics we can insert to increase impact.\\n\\nLine-by-line edits with reasoning\\n- Original: helps customers with questions and returns\\n  Edit: Assist customers with inquiries and process returns in accordance with store policy\\n  Reasoning: “Assist” is a stronger verb than “helps”; present tense; “inquiries” is more professional; adds specificity and compliance.\\n\\n- Original: Responsible for cash register closing\\n  Edit: Close POS registers and reconcile cash drawers at shift end\\n  Reasoning: Avoid “Responsible for” (weak, passive). Use direct action verbs (“Close,” “reconcile”). Adds detail (POS/registers, cash drawers, timing).\\n\\n- Original: Trained two new hires on stocking\\n  Edit: Train new hires on stocking procedures and safety; trained two associates to date\\n  Reasoning: Present tense for ongoing responsibility with a concise past-achievement note; adds clarity on “procedures and safety.”\\n\\n- Original: improved sales by talking more about rewards card\\n  Edit: Increase sales by promoting the store rewards program to customers\\n  Optional (if you have metrics): Increased rewards program sign-ups by [X]% to drive incremental sales\\n  Reasoning: Stronger verb (“Increase”), more professional phrasing (“promoting the store rewards program” vs. “talking more”), avoids vague “improved” unless you can quantify.\\n\\n- Original: Organized the backroom inventory (ongoing)\\n  Edit: Organize back room inventory to maintain accurate stock levels and efficient replenishment\\n  Reasoning: Present tense for an ongoing responsibility; “back room” is clearer than “backroom”; adds purpose/outcome (“accurate stock levels,” “efficient replenishment”).\\n\\nOverall feedback\\n- Stronger verbs and clearer objects make your contributions more impactful.\\n- Keep responsibilities in present tense for a current role; if you prefer, notable completed achievements can be in past tense (e.g., “Trained two associates”).\\n- Replace passive constructions (“Responsible for”) with direct actions.\\n- Add measurable outcomes wherever possible (percentages, counts, time saved).\\n\\nSpelling edits\\n- backroom → back room (common usage for the physical space; “backroom” can imply behind-the-scenes dealings)\\n- rewards card → rewards program (if your store uses “rewards card,” keep that term; otherwise “program” reads broadly and professionally)\\n\\nGrammar edits\\n- Use parallel, action-led phrasing across bullets (each begins with a verb).\\n- Maintain present tense for current role: Assist, Close, Train, Increase, Organize.\\n- Avoid filler words and parentheses; integrate “ongoing” by using present tense rather than “(ongoing).”\\n- Capitalization: Start each bullet with a capital letter; use sentence case, not Title Case, within bullets.\\n\\nStructural suggestions (ordering for maximum impact)\\n- Lead with results and leadership, then customer service, then operational reliability:\\n  1) Increase sales by promoting the store rewards program to customers\\n  2) Train new hires on stocking procedures and safety; trained two associates to date\\n  3) Assist customers with inquiries and process returns in accordance with store policy\\n  4) Close POS registers and reconcile cash drawers at shift end\\n  5) Organize back room inventory to maintain accurate stock levels and efficient replenishment\\n- If targeting an operations-focused internship, you might move inventory and cash handling higher.\\n\\nOpportunities for improvement\\n- Quantify: add numbers (% sales increase, # of sign-ups, $ cash reconciled per shift, # of returns processed daily, # SKUs maintained in back room).\\n- Tools/Systems: name the POS system or inventory software (e.g., Square, NCR, Microsoft Excel).\\n- Compliance/Accuracy: note accuracy rate or audit outcomes (e.g., zero variances over X weeks).\\n- Customer impact: add a customer satisfaction measure if available (CSAT, NPS, or manager feedback).\\n\\nFormatting guidance (resume standards)\\n- Use consistent bullet style: either all bullets end with no period (common) or all with a period—choose one and keep it consistent.\\n- Keep present tense for current role; use past tense only for previous jobs or closed accomplishments if you prefer that nuance.\\n- Avoid first person (“I”), articles where not needed, and fillers (“responsible for”).\\n- Keep capitalization consistent: capitalized first word, standard sentence case thereafter; capitalize formal program or system names.\\n- Numbers: use numerals (e.g., 2, 15%, $1,200); include ranges or averages as needed.\\n- Avoid parentheses in bullets; integrate details into the sentence.\\n\\nWould you like me to generate the edited bullet list now?\\n- I can provide a ready-to-paste version in your preferred style (with or without periods), and I can insert any metrics you share.\\n- If you confirm these are for a current role, I’ll keep them all in present tense, with one optional past-tense clause for completed achievements if you want that style.\",\n    \"metrics\": {\n      \"groundtruth-eval with azure:o4-mini_2025-04-16\": {\n        \"content\": \"{\\\"score\\\":70,\\\"explanation\\\":\\\"Missed exact headings and grammar edit specifics\\\"}\",\n        \"score\": 70\n      }\n    },\n    \"compliance\": \"ok\",\n    \"complianceText\": \"Follows the prescribed structure: asks questions, overview, line-by-line edits, categorized feedback, then offers next steps.  \\nOK\",\n    \"isGroundtruth\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"5861287\",\n    \"promptid\": \"b7651b1\",\n    \"ruleid\": null,\n    \"testuid\": \"baseline-test-y2czw2kqp\",\n    \"scenario\": \"\",\n    \"baseline\": true,\n    \"testinput\": \"goals: Ensure scientific clarity, fix passive voice excess, polish tense consistency, and improve figure/table references\\ntype_of_writing: lab report (Introduction and Results excerpts)\\ntarget_audience: high school chemistry teacher\\nfeedback_focus: line-by-line grammar and style edits with reasoning;

If there’s more, please paste it so I can edit the whole piece line by line.\\n- Do you have a specific prompt or theme you’re responding to?\\n- Are there particular outcomes you want to highlight (for example, how the website affected the business, any community responses, or how this experience connects to your interests in college)?\\n\\nOverview of how I’ll help:\\n- Sharpen clarity and tone without losing authenticity.\\n- Strengthen the arc from early responsibility to concrete action to reflection and future goals.\\n- Suggest precise word choices and small grammar fixes for polish.\\n- Recommend structural additions (brief scenes, concrete outcomes, and a tight closing) to reach 600–650 words.\\n\\nOverall Feedback:\\n- Strengths: The opening image (translating bank forms), the concrete action during the pandemic, and the reflection on community are compelling and genuine. Your voice feels grounded and humble.\\n- Opportunities: Add one or two vivid micro-scenes (e.g., a moment in the bank office or delivering a flyer) and a specific outcome (e.g., increased orders, messages from customers). Clarify the connection to college by naming the broader skills or areas you hope to develop (e.g., navigating systems, communications, community organizing, business/tech tools).\\n- Arc: You already have a clear arc—responsibility → action → learning → purpose.

We kept going.”\\n- Reason: Splitting the sentence improves rhythm and avoids a pile-up of commas; the short second sentence adds emphasis.\\n\\n6) “This taught me how community isn’t a slogan; it’s people showing up for each other.”\\n- Suggested edit: “This taught me that community isn’t a slogan; it’s people showing up for each other.”\\n- Reason: “that” is the correct conjunction for a statement of realization.\\n\\n7) “I still worry about sounding ‘right,’ but I’ve learned to ask questions and keep trying even when I’m unsure.”\\n- Optional tweak: “I still worry about sounding ‘right,’ but I’ve learned to ask questions and keep trying, even when I’m unsure.”\\n- Reason: A comma before the final clause smooths pacing; keeping the quotes preserves your voice.\\n\\n8) “College, to me, is a place to grow that force of trying into something that can help others, especially families navigating systems that pretend to be simple.”\\n- Suggested edit: “To me, college is a place to turn that persistence into work that helps others—especially families navigating systems that seem simple on the surface.”\\n- Reason: “turn that persistence into work” tightens the abstract phrase; “seem simple on the surface” softens the tone slightly while preserving your point.\\n\\nSpelling Edits:\\n- “first-generation” is correctly hyphenated.\\n- “Mexican American” is correct; no hyphen needed in this usage.\\n- “flyers” is fine (U.S. usage). “fliers” is also acceptable; choose one and use it consistently.\\n\\nGrammar Edits:\\n- Prefer “as if I were” to “like I was” for formal tone.\\n- Use “that” after “taught me” for correct syntax.\\n- Consider splitting longer compound sentences (as in “It wasn’t perfect, but it worked. We kept going.”).\\n- Replace “on my cracked phone” with “using my cracked phone” for idiomatic clarity.\\n\\nStructural Suggestions (to reach ~600–650 words):\\n- Paragraph 1 (hook + context): Keep your opening but add a micro-scene (e.g., a moment in the bank office with a specific phrase you translated and how it made you feel). 120–150 words.\\n- Paragraph 2 (challenge + actions): Expand the pandemic period. Describe your strategy briefly (creating flyers, writing emails, what you put on the website), and include one concrete outcome (e.g., number of new orders, partnerships, a thank-you message). 200–250 words.\\n- Paragraph 3 (reflection): Tie your actions to a broader lesson—learning to ask questions, demystifying systems, building trust. 120–150 words.\\n- Paragraph 4 (forward-looking close): Connect the skills and mindset to what you hope to develop in college (e.g., tools for small businesses or families, communication, data, policy, tech). End with a concise return to your opening metaphor (“the language of responsibility” and community). 120–150 words.\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement:\\n- Add one brief, concrete detail about the website (e.g., menu photos, order form, testimonials) and how you spread the word (texts, local Facebook groups, church bulletin).\\n- Include a measurable or observable result to show impact.\\n- Show a moment of uncertainty and how you resolved it (e.g., teaching yourself a website builder, asking a librarian for help).\\n- Name transferable skills: translating complex information, perseverance, community-building, communication.\\n- Clarify your future direction (fields or skills you want to build) without locking into a major: this helps admissions readers see growth potential.\\n\\nFormatting Guidance (650-word limit, admissions conventions):\\n- Aim for 3–5 short paragraphs with clear transitions.\\n- Vary sentence lengths; avoid long strings of clauses.\\n- Standard punctuation is best; an em dash or semicolon is fine sparingly.\\n- Keep language clean and direct; avoid jargon.\\n- Stay under 650 words; 600–640 reads well and leaves room for final polishing.\\n\\nWould you like me to:\\n- Edit the full ~590-word draft line by line?\\n- Or expand this excerpt into a polished 600–650-word essay that incorporates these suggestions while keeping your voice?\\n\\nIf you want, I can also generate a revised version of this paragraph now, incorporating the specific edits above.\",\n    \"metrics\": {\n      \"groundtruth-eval with azure:o4-mini_2025-04-16\": {\n        \"content\": \"{\\\"explanation\\\":\\\"Missing exact “Overview” heading.\\\",\\\"score\\\":90}\",\n        \"score\": 90\n      }\n    },\n    \"compliance\": \"ok\",\n    \"complianceText\": \"Everything aligns well with the described editorial framework: it asks clarifying questions, gives an overview, organizes feedback into the required categories, explains each suggestion, maintains a constructive tone, and offers next steps.  \\nOK\",\n    \"isGroundtruth\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"20e21ec\",\n    \"promptid\": \"b7651b1\",\n    \"ruleid\": null,\n    \"testuid\": \"baseline-test-979705jj1\",\n    \"scenario\": \"\",\n    \"baseline\": true,\n    \"testinput\": \"goals: Improve word choice, check capitalization and punctuation; preserve line breaks and imagery\\ntype_of_writing: poem (free verse)\\ntarget_audience: school literary journal\\nfeedback_focus: line-by-line edits with reasoning; subtle style suggestions; formatting guidance for line breaks/stanzas\\nformatting: poetry conventions (intentional capitalization choices, em-dashes)\\ntone_preferences: lyrical, contemplative\\nconstraints: maintain metaphors and core images; do not impose rhyme\\ntext: the sun dropps behind the hill—\\ni chase the day like a late bus,\\nshoes unlaced, the gravel keeps my secrets.\\nI call the trees my witnesses\\nand they don’t answer (they never did)\\nbut the leaves clap anyway, a small stadium.\\ntomorrow is a folded map in my pocket\\nthat I forgot to unfold.\",\n    \"model\": \"gpt-5-2025-08-07\",\n    \"input\": \"goals: Improve word choice, check capitalization and punctuation; preserve line breaks and imagery\\ntype_of_writing: poem (free verse)\\ntarget_audience: school literary journal\\nfeedback_focus: line-by-line edits with reasoning; subtle style suggestions; formatting guidance for line breaks/stanzas\\nformatting: poetry conventions (intentional capitalization choices, em-dashes)\\ntone_preferences: lyrical, contemplative\\nconstraints: maintain metaphors and core images; do not impose rhyme\\ntext: the sun dropps behind the hill—\\ni chase the day like a late bus,\\nshoes unlaced, the gravel keeps my secrets.\\nI call the trees my witnesses\\nand they don’t answer (they never did)\\nbut the leaves clap anyway, a small stadium.\\ntomorrow is a folded map in my pocket\\nthat I forgot to unfold.\",\n    \"output\": \"Thanks for sharing your poem.

Your current poem mixes both.\\n- Are you open to small tense tweaks to keep the poem present-focused?\\n- Do you prefer parentheses for asides, or would you like to use em dashes for a more seamless, lyrical flow?\\n\\nOverview of the editorial approach\\n- Correct the single spelling error.\\n- Smooth tense consistency so the poem stays present-focused.\\n- Suggest a consistent capitalization approach (either all-lowercase for a lyrical, contemplative tone or standard capitalization for a more formal journal style).\\n- Offer subtle punctuation adjustments (em dashes vs commas/parentheses) to enhance cadence.\\n- Provide optional word-choice refinements that keep your metaphors intact.\\n- Offer an optional stanza break to heighten the emotional turn.\\n\\nLine-by-line edits with reasoning\\n- Line 1: “the sun dropps behind the hill—”\\n  - Change “dropps” to “drops” (spelling).\\n  - Keep the em dash; it works well as a lingering pause and sets the contemplative tone.\\n  - Capitalization choice: if you go all-lowercase, this line is already aligned.\\n\\n- Line 2: “i chase the day like a late bus,”\\n  - This line reads well. The simile is vivid and contemporary.\\n  - Capitalization choice: keep “i” lowercase if you choose the all-lowercase style; otherwise change to “I.”\\n\\n- Line 3: “shoes unlaced, the gravel keeps my secrets.”\\n  - The comma works, but consider an em dash for a more lyrical hinge: “shoes unlaced—the gravel keeps my secrets.”\\n  - Reason: the dash strengthens the connection and adds a musical pause. The phrase “keeps my secrets” is strong; if you want a tactile nuance, “holds” is an option, but “keeps” maintains the confidentiality image.\\n\\n- Line 4: “I call the trees my witnesses”\\n  - For capitalization consistency, use either “i” (if all-lowercase) or keep “I” and adjust earlier lines to standard case.\\n  - Optional word choice: “name the trees my witnesses” is slightly more formal/ceremonial; “call” is more conversational. Choose based on the tone you want.\\n\\n- Line 5: “and they don’t answer (they never did)”\\n  - Tense consistency: change “did” to “do” to keep the poem in the present: “and they don’t answer (they never do).”\\n  - If you prefer a seamless flow, consider an em dash instead of parentheses: “and they don’t answer— they never do.” Parentheses feel more self-aware; em dashes feel more embedded in the voice.\\n\\n- Line 6: “but the leaves clap anyway, a small stadium.”\\n  - Consider an em dash to clarify the apposition: “but the leaves clap anyway—a small stadium.”\\n  - Reason: the dash emphasizes “a small stadium” as a metaphorical rename rather than a loose addition. If you prefer a simile, “like a small stadium” is also clear, but the metaphor is stronger as-is.\\n\\n- Line 7: “tomorrow is a folded map in my pocket”\\n  - Strong image; reads clearly. No changes needed.\\n  - If you adopt standard capitalization, capitalize “Tomorrow.”\\n\\n- Line 8: “that I forgot to unfold.”\\n  - Tense consistency: shift to present perfect for cohesion with the rest of the poem: “that I haven’t yet unfolded.”\\n  - If you prefer a more direct phrasing, you can end the poem with an em dash for a quiet, suspended feeling:\\n    - “that I haven’t yet unfolded—”\\n    - Or add the pronoun for clarity: “that I haven’t yet unfolded it.” (This slightly reduces the elegance; the noun “map” already carries the action.)\\n\\nOverall Feedback\\n- Strengths: Your imagery is vivid and coherent—the late bus, witnesses of trees, stadium of leaves, and the folded map work together as a persuasive meditation on urgency and intention. Sound devices like “shoes,” “secrets,” and “stadium” give the poem soft consonance. The em dash in line 1 sets a reflective pace that suits the lyrical tone.\\n- Main improvements: Correct the spelling error, unify capitalization, and maintain present-tense consistency. A few punctuation adjustments can heighten the rhythm and clarity without changing your metaphors.\\n\\nSpelling Edits\\n- “dropps” → “drops”\\n  - Reason: Standard spelling.\\n\\nGrammar Edits\\n- Tense consistency:\\n  - “(they never did)” → “(they never do)” to keep present tense across the poem.\\n  - “that I forgot to unfold” → “that I haven’t yet unfolded” to align with present-focused narration.\\n- Capitalization consistency:\\n  - Choose one of the following:\\n    - All-lowercase style for a contemplative, modern feel: “i” throughout; keep line-initial words lowercase.\\n    - Standard capitalization for literary journal formality: Capitalize “The,” “I,” “Tomorrow,” and sentence beginnings.\\n\\nStructural Suggestions\\n- Consider a stanza break after line 6 to separate the external scene (chasing day, trees, leaves) from the inward turn (tomorrow as a map). For example:\\n  - Stanza 1: lines 1–6\\n  - Stanza 2: lines 7–8\\n  - Reason: It creates a clean pivot from witness/response to intention/future.\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement\\n- Punctuation cadence:\\n  - Line 3: Em dash instead of comma can strengthen the hinge between action and secrecy.\\n  - Line 6: Em dash before “a small stadium” clarifies apposition and heightens the image.\\n- Optional word-choice refinements (only if desired):\\n  - “call” → “name” for a ceremonial tone.\\n  - “keeps” → “holds” for tactile resonance. These are stylistic, not necessary.\\n\\nFormatting Guidance\\n- Em dashes: Use a true em dash (—) with no surrounding spaces for a clean, contemporary look, as you’ve done in line 1. If you add more dashes, keep that convention consistent.\\n- Parenthetical aside vs em dash: Parentheses create a thoughtful whisper; em dashes integrate the aside into the line’s flow. Either is acceptable—choose one style and apply it consistently.\\n- Capitalization:\\n  - All-lowercase is an accepted poetry convention and suits a contemplative tone; ensure “i” is consistently lowercase if you choose this.\\n  - If the journal favors standard capitalization, use sentence case for lines that form complete sentences.\\n- Line breaks: Your current breaks work well and should be preserved. If you add a stanza break after line 6, insert one blank line between stanzas.\\n\\nWould you like me to generate the edited poem? I can provide:\\n- Version A: all-lowercase with em dashes (contemplative style).\\n- Version B: standard capitalization with either em dashes or parentheses (more formal journal style).\\n\\nIf you have a preference on parentheses vs em dashes and capitalization style, tell me which you’d like, and I’ll produce the polished version accordingly.\",\n    \"metrics\": {\n      \"groundtruth-eval with azure:o4-mini_2025-04-16\": {\n        \"content\": \"{\\\"score\\\":95,\\\"explanation\\\":\\\"Missing exact “Overview” heading.\\\"}\",\n        \"score\": 95\n      }\n    },\n    \"compliance\": \"ok\",\n    \"complianceText\": \"Aligned with described editing process: overview, line-by-line edits, categories, clarifying questions, offer to rewrite.\\nOK\",\n    \"isGroundtruth\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"771c6cf\",\n    \"promptid\": \"b7651b1\",\n    \"ruleid\": null,\n    \"testuid\": \"baseline-test-dpyx4vb7j\",\n    \"scenario\": \"\",\n    \"baseline\": true,\n    \"testinput\": \"goals: Clarify thesis and evaluation criteria; fix grammar and tone; suggest structure\\ntype_of_writing: book review\\ntarget_audience: classmates and teacher\\nfeedback_focus: line-by-line edits with reasoning; structural suggestions (intro-summary-analysis-conclusion); formatting guidance\\nformatting: MLA for book titles and quotes\\ntone_preferences: analytical yet accessible\\nconstraints: include at least one quote; avoid spoilers beyond mid-point\\ntext: In The Giver by Lois Lowry, the community seems perfect but actually its not.

Evaluating the book’s symbolism, pacing, and thematic depth, I argue that Lowry’s use of color powerfully represents freedom and choice, the mid-book pacing reduces urgency, and the ending—though ambiguous—invites thoughtful discussion.\\n\\nSummary (early plot only):\\nJonas lives in an orderly society designed to eliminate conflict and difference. Early in the novel, he notices an apple “change,” a moment that foreshadows his changing perception of the world and hints that not everything in his community is what it seems.\\n\\nAnalysis:\\nColor functions as a symbol of individuality and possibility, contrasting with the community’s uniform uniformity. As Jonas’s perceptions broaden, Lowry suggests that true choice requires the ability to perceive differences, linking the novel’s exploration of memory to moral responsibility. While the middle sections slow, the measured pacing mirrors the community’s controlled routine and emphasizes how difficult it is to disrupt a system built on predictability.\\n\\nConclusion:\\nAlthough the ending resists a tidy resolution, its openness is effective because it pushes readers to consider what safety costs and who pays that price. Overall, I recommend The Giver because it prompts reflection on choices, memory, and the price of safety.\\n\\nWould you like me to:\\n- Expand the analysis with one more early-text quote?\\n- Add MLA in-text citations with page numbers from your edition?\\n- Format a complete Works Cited section based on your edition details?\",\n    \"metrics\": {\n      \"groundtruth-eval with azure:o4-mini_2025-04-16\": {\n        \"content\": \"{\\\"score\\\":80,\\\"explanation\\\":\\\"Missing Overall Feedback section\\\"}\",\n        \"score\": 80\n      }\n    },\n    \"compliance\": \"ok\",\n    \"complianceText\": \"Structured feedback aligns with required categories, reasoning, tone, and step-by-step instructions.  \\nOK\",\n    \"isGroundtruth\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"3825c80\",\n    \"promptid\": \"b7651b1\",\n    \"ruleid\": null,\n    \"testuid\": \"baseline-test-0ufvxdvuo\",\n    \"scenario\": \"\",\n    \"baseline\": true,\n    \"testinput\": \"goals: Improve clarity, consistency, and citation formatting; ensure a coherent argument\\ntype_of_writing: history research paper excerpt\\ntarget_audience: AP U.S. History teacher\\nfeedback_focus: line-by-line grammar and style edits with reasoning; structural suggestions; formatting and citation guidance\\nformatting: Chicago Notes-Bibliography (footnotes), page numbers, proper quotation format\\ntone_preferences: formal, objective\\nconstraints: keep footnote markers [1], [2] as placeholders; do not add sources\\ntext: The New Deal did not end the Great Depression; however, it redefined the relationship between citizens and the federal government.

It focuses your attention on what you should ignore.”\\n  - Suggestion: “This isn’t negative—it helps you focus on what to ignore.”\\n  - Reason: More natural phrasing, contraction fits friendly tone, em dash improves flow, trims repetition (“you should”).\\n\\n- Example: “For example, checking Twitter every 10 minutes is a bad loop I had.”\\n  - Suggestion: “For example, checking Twitter every 10 minutes was a habit I fell into.”\\n  - Reason: Past tense alignment (“was”), “habit” is clearer than “loop,” “fell into” is idiomatic and concise.\\n\\n- H2: “## Tip 2: Set \\\"good enough\\\" deadlines”\\n  - Suggestion: “## Tip 2: Set ‘Good-Enough’ Deadlines”\\n  - Reason: Title Case for headings, hyphenate “Good-Enough” when used as a compound adjective, use consistent quotation style (single quotes in headings are optional but keep consistent; alternatively remove quotes entirely for cleaner web style: “Set Good-Enough Deadlines”).\\n\\n- Body: “Perfectionism is a trap. If you schedule shorter blocks and accept B+ work at first, you will move faster.”\\n  - Suggestion: “Perfectionism is a trap. Schedule shorter time blocks and accept B+ work initially—you’ll move faster.”\\n  - Reason: Imperative form is more direct for web; “time blocks” adds clarity; “initially” is smoother; em dash creates a tight conclusion.\\n\\n- H2: “## Conclusion”\\n  - Suggestion: Keep as is.\\n\\n- Conclusion body: “Doing less is surprisingly brave. You will feel weird at first, but then free.”\\n  - Suggestion: “Doing less can be surprisingly brave. It may feel uncomfortable at first, but the payoff is freedom.”\\n  - Reason: “Can be” softens the claim, “uncomfortable” is clearer than “weird,” and “payoff is freedom” lands with a stronger, positive close.\\n\\nOverall Feedback\\n- Strong core idea and friendly tone. The simple, actionable tips fit a productivity audience.\\n- Key improvements: fix tense consistency, “less” vs. “fewer,” and make headings uniform and scannable. Add micro-examples or bullets under each tip for quick takeaways.\\n\\nSpelling Edits\\n- No outright spelling errors found.\\n- Consistency: “Twitter” is correctly capitalized. Consider consistent quotation style (single vs. double quotes). For web headings, you can drop quotes.\\n\\nGrammar Edits\\n- Past tense in the intro: “need” → “needed.”\\n- Count vs. mass nouns: “less options/tabs” → “fewer options/fewer tabs”; “less guilt” stays “less.”\\n- Idiomatic phrasing: “bad loop I had” → “habit I fell into.”\\n- Parallel structure and concision: remove “If” and use imperative in Tip 2 for a tighter message.\\n\\nStructural Suggestions\\n- Use H2 for each tip and H3 for brief examples or mini-checklists.\\n- Add scannable bullets under each tip:\\n  - Tip 1 bullets:\\n    - Try this: Write 3 things to ignore today (e.g., “Twitter refresh,” “email tabs after 7 p.m.,” “new app trials”).\\n    - Why it works: Reduces decision fatigue and removes low-value distractions.\\n  - Tip 2 bullets:\\n    - Try this: Set a 25–30 minute block; define “B+” criteria (clear, complete, not perfect).\\n    - Why it works: Time-boxing + “good-enough” standard speeds momentum.\\n- Consider a short one-line hook before the intro to grab attention (optional): “The fastest way I beat procrastination? I started doing less.”\\n- Keep paragraphs short (1–3 sentences) and avoid long clauses for readability.\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement\\n- Add one sentence to connect the two tips: “Both strategies eliminate decision friction so you can start faster.”\\n- Optional CTA: Invite readers to try one change today and share results (e.g., comment or share).\\n- If you plan to add links (e.g., to a Not-To-Do template or a time-boxing guide), place them at the end of each tip with descriptive anchor text.\\n\\nFormatting Guidance (web style: H2/H3, short paragraphs, bullets)\\n- Headings:\\n  - H2: Tip titles (Title Case, avoid quotes when possible).\\n  - H3: Example or “Try this” under each tip.\\n- Paragraphs: 1–3 sentences each; aim for ~15–20 words per sentence.\\n- Bullets: Use simple, parallel phrasing; start with verbs (“Write,” “Set,” “Define”).\\n- Links: Use descriptive anchors (“Not-To-Do template”), keep them intact, and place them after the relevant sentence or as a bullet.\\n- Punctuation: Use em dashes sparingly for emphasis; avoid exclamation points unless intentional for tone.\\n- Consistency: Use Title Case for headings; sentence case in body copy.\\n\\nWould you like me to generate a clean, edited version with H2/H3 headings, short paragraphs, and bullets, incorporating all these changes?

The main edits are minor: replacing nonstandard phrasing (“It be”) with standard American English, clarifying idioms (“I have 15 years”), and tightening wording for clarity (“speaking both” → “speaking both languages”).\\n- The flow is already strong; a small tweak to sentence structure will make it even clearer and more polished for a classroom audience.\\n\\nLine-by-line edits with reasoning\\n1) Original: “Mi familia and I moved to the U.S. when I was 10, and I used to translate for my parents at la escuela office.”\\n   Edited: “My family and I moved to the U.S. when I was ten, and I used to translate for my parents at the school office.”\\n   Reasoning:\\n   - Standardize to American English: “Mi familia” → “My family”; “la escuela office” → “the school office.”\\n   - Style: Spell out small numbers in narrative prose (“ten” instead of “10”) for a more formal, polished feel.\\n   - Clarity: “the school office” is the natural phrasing in American English.\\n\\n2) Original: “Sometimes I say things like ‘I have 15 years’ because that’s how we say it in Spanish, and people laugh a little.”\\n   Edited: “Sometimes I say things like ‘I have fifteen years’ because that’s how we say it in Spanish, and people laugh a little.”\\n   Reasoning:\\n   - Preserve the cultural reference by keeping the quoted phrase as an example of direct translation.\\n   - Style: Spell out “fifteen” in the quote to match the rest of the paragraph’s number style.\\n   - This sentence can remain as one, but you could split it for emphasis (see Structural Suggestions).\\n\\n3) Original: “It be confusing switching back and forth, but I’m learning to slow down and think in English first when needed, and also not be ashamed of speaking both.”\\n   Edited: “It can be confusing to switch between languages, but I’m learning to slow down, think in English first when needed, and not be ashamed of speaking both languages.”\\n   Reasoning:\\n   - Grammar: Replace nonstandard “It be” with standard “It can be.”\\n   - Clarity: “switch between languages” specifies what you’re switching.\\n   - Parallel structure: “slow down, think…, and not be ashamed…” reads more smoothly.\\n   - Specificity: “both languages” clarifies “both.”\\n\\nSpelling Edits\\n- “Mi familia” → “My family” (standard American English).\\n- “la escuela office” → “the school office” (standard American English).\\n- “10” → “ten” and “15” → “fifteen” (style consistency in narrative prose).\\n\\nGrammar Edits\\n- “It be confusing” → “It can be confusing” (subject-verb agreement and standard usage).\\n- Add “languages” after “speaking both” for clarity and completeness.\\n- Adjusted parallel structure in the final sentence for smoother reading.\\n\\nStructural Suggestions\\n- Consider splitting the second sentence into two for emphasis:\\n  - “Sometimes I say things like ‘I have fifteen years’ because that’s how we say it in Spanish. People laugh a little.”\\n- Alternatively, begin with a general statement about switching languages, then give the example:\\n  - “Switching between languages can be confusing. Sometimes I say things like ‘I have fifteen years’ because that’s how we say it in Spanish, and people laugh a little.”\\n- Both options slightly increase clarity and rhetorical impact while keeping your original meaning.\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement\\n- Add a brief detail about what you translated at the school office (forms, conversations with staff) to give a concrete image.\\n- Include one sentence about how the laughter made you feel and what changed as you learned to navigate both languages; this deepens the personal reflection.\\n- If appropriate for your teacher, you could name “code-switching” explicitly once, to show awareness of the concept.\\n\\nFormatting Guidance\\n- Use standard American English throughout; if you keep any Spanish terms, consider italicizing them and/or adding a brief parenthetical translation the first time they appear (e.g., escuela [school]).\\n- Spell out numbers from zero to nine in narrative prose; for ages and simple counts, spelling out “ten” and “fifteen” is acceptable and reads more formal.\\n- Use straight quotation marks consistently for typed work unless your teacher prefers curly quotes.\\n\\nWould you like me to fully standardize (remove Spanish words) or keep one or two Spanish terms italicized as cultural markers? I can tailor the final paragraph either way.\\n\\nEdited paragraph (standard American English)\\nMy family and I moved to the U.S. when I was ten, and I used to translate for my parents at the school office.

I can turn this into a coherent, motivational speech with smooth transitions, and provide line-by-line edits, structural suggestions, and speaking-note formatting. Before I finalize, two quick questions:\\n- Is a brief personal anecdote okay to include (you mention “I felt it last semester”)?\\n- Does your assignment require at least one cited statistic, or is a general reference to research acceptable?\\n\\nOverview of approach\\n- Tighten each line for grammar, clarity, and parallel structure.\\n- Add transitions that connect each section and build momentum.\\n- Expand the solution into clear, actionable steps that fit a 5–6 minute delivery.\\n- Format the speaking outline with cue words and timing estimates so it’s easy to deliver.\\n\\nOverall Feedback\\n- Strengths: Clear problem-solution frame, relatable hook, concise plan with three practical steps, strong close and call to action.\\n- Main improvements: Use subjunctive grammar in the hook, add a specific example in the evidence section, strengthen the counterargument, and smooth transitions between sections. Keep each step behaviorally specific so your audience can try it for 7 days.\\n\\nSpelling Edits (with reasoning)\\n- grayscale → correct as one word. Reason: Standard usage for display setting.\\n- no-phone mornings → keep hyphenated. Reason: Hyphen clarifies the compound adjective.\\n- check-ins → include hyphen. Reason: “Check-in” is hyphenated in noun form; plural is “check-ins.”\\n- “Screen time going up; attention going down.” → Keep “screen time” as two words; “attention” is correct.\\n\\nGrammar Edits (with reasoning)\\n- Hook: “Imagine if your phone is the boss of you.” → “Imagine if your phone were the boss of you.” Reason: Use the subjunctive “were” for a hypothetical.\\n- Evidence: “grades slipping, sleep shorter, I felt it last semester.” → “Grades slipped, my sleep got shorter, and I felt it last semester.” Reason: Parallel verb forms and add a conjunction to avoid a comma splice.\\n- Counter: “Phones are tools—yes, but tools shape us.” → “Phones are tools—yes. But tools also shape us.” Reason: Split into two sentences for emphasis; “also” signals concession with contrast.\\n- Solution: “3 steps: grayscale, no-phone mornings, buddy check-ins.” → “Three steps: turn on grayscale, try no-phone mornings, and set up buddy check-ins.” Reason: Spell out “three” in speech and use parallel imperative phrases.\\n- Close: “Ask audience to try it for 7 days.” → “Ask the audience to try it for seven days.” Reason: Spell out single-digit numbers in speech.\\n\\nStructural Suggestions (with reasoning)\\n- Order: Hook → Problem → Evidence (personal and one brief stat) → Counterargument → Solution (three steps) → Call to Action → Close. Reason: This sequence builds logic and motivation, keeping the audience engaged.\\n- Add transitions: Use “Here’s what that looks like,” “But there’s a catch,” and “So what can we do?” to guide listeners.\\n- Make each step concrete: Add “how,” “when,” and “why it helps” for each step to increase follow-through and fit the 7-day challenge.\\n- Time cues: Aim for roughly 30–45 seconds per early section, 2 minutes for the solution, and 1 minute for the call to action and close, totaling about 5–6 minutes.\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement\\n- Include one credible data point on attention, grades, or sleep (e.g., a brief stat from the CDC, APA, or a school survey). Keep it short: one sentence.\\n- Add a one-sentence personal anecdote to humanize the problem.\\n- Offer a simple way to measure progress (e.g., “Notice how many times you pick up your phone before lunch,” or “Track sleep for seven days”).\\n- Preempt objections: Acknowledge phones help us study and connect; you’re offering small guardrails, not a ban.\\n\\nFormatting Guidance for Speaking Notes\\n- Use clear section headers in ALL CAPS: HOOK, PROBLEM, EVIDENCE, COUNTER, SOLUTION, CALL TO ACTION, CLOSE.\\n- Keep one idea per line; aim for short phrases, not full paragraphs.\\n- Add cue words in brackets: [PAUSE], [LOOK UP], [SLOW DOWN], [SHOW OF HANDS].\\n- Put transitions on their own lines to help delivery.\\n- Include approximate time per section, so you hit 5–6 minutes.\\n- Bold is optional; if not available, use caps for emphasis; underline key phrases by writing them in caps (e.g., YOU DESERVE YOUR ATTENTION BACK).\\n\\nEdited Speaking Outline (5–6 minutes, with cue words)\\nHOOK (0:30)\\n- Imagine if your phone were the boss of you. [PAUSE] What would it tell you to do—now, now, now? [LOOK UP]\\n  Reason: Subjunctive “were” for hypothetical; short punchy questions create engagement.\\n\\nPROBLEM (0:45)\\n- Our screen time is going up; our attention is going down. [PAUSE]\\n- The cost? More distraction, less deep focus, and decisions that feel rushed.\\n  Reason: Parallel structure (“going up / going down”); names concrete consequences.\\n\\nEVIDENCE (1:00)\\n- Quick stat: Research links heavy screen use with shorter sleep and lower academic performance. [PAUSE]\\n- My example: Last semester, my grades slipped and my sleep got shorter because I kept scrolling past midnight. [SLOW DOWN]\\n  Reason: One concise research claim, plus a personal anecdote to ground the message.\\n\\nCOUNTERARGUMENT (0:45)\\n- Phones are tools—yes. But tools also shape us. [PAUSE]\\n- I’m not saying ditch your phone; I’m saying add small guardrails so the tool serves you. [LOOK UP]\\n  Reason: Acknowledge benefits; reframe as balance, not abstinence.\\n\\nTRANSITION (0:10)\\n- So what can we do—starting this week? [PAUSE]\\n  Reason: Signals the move to solutions and the 7-day challenge.\\n\\nSOLUTION: THREE STEPS (2:00)\\n- Step 1: Turn on grayscale. [PAUSE]\\n  - How: Switch your display to grayscale after 8 p.m. on weekdays. [PAUSE]\\n  - Why: Less color = fewer “click me” cues; it makes late-night scrolling less tempting.\\n  Reason: Imperative framing; time-bound instruction increases follow-through.\\n\\n- Step 2: No-phone mornings. [PAUSE]\\n  - How: For the first 30 minutes after you wake up, no social apps or texts. Start with water, stretch, and your first task. [LOOK UP]\\n  - Why: Protects your freshest attention; sets your focus before notifications set it for you.\\n  Reason: Concrete duration and replacement behaviors reduce friction.\\n\\n- Step 3: Buddy check-ins. [PAUSE]\\n  - How: Pair with a classmate today; send a one-line check-in each morning for seven days (“Grayscale on, 30-min no-phone done”). [SMILE]\\n  - Why: Accountability beats willpower. Share wins; reset if you slip.\\n  Reason: Simple script lowers barrier; normalizes imperfection.\\n\\nCALL TO ACTION (0:45)\\n- Try these three steps for seven days. Start tonight: grayscale at 8 p.m. [PAUSE]\\n- Tomorrow morning: 30 minutes no phone. [PAUSE]\\n- Before you leave class: pick a buddy. [SHOW OF HANDS] Who’s in?\\n  Reason: Break CTA into immediate, next, and today actions; invite participation.\\n\\nCLOSE (0:30)\\n- You deserve your attention back. [PAUSE] Give it seven days—and see what changes.\\n- If it helps, keep it. If not, adjust. But let your phone serve you, not boss you. [LOOK UP]\\n  Reason: Motivational yet grounded; emphasizes autonomy and experiment.\\n\\nLine-by-line Edits with Reasoning (comparing your original lines)\\n- Hook: “Imagine if your phone is the boss of you.” → “Imagine if your phone were the boss of you.”\\n  Reason: The subjunctive “were” fits hypothetical statements; it also sounds more polished in speech.\\n\\n- Problem: “Screen time going up; attention going down.” → “Our screen time is going up; our attention is going down.”\\n  Reason: Add “our” for audience inclusion; keep parallel structure for rhythm.\\n\\n- Evidence: “grades slipping, sleep shorter, I felt it last semester.” → “My grades slipped, my sleep got shorter, and I felt it last semester.”\\n  Reason: Use parallel past-tense verbs; add “my” for clarity and personal ownership; include “and” to avoid a comma splice.\\n\\n- Counter: “Phones are tools—yes, but tools shape us.” → “Phones are tools—yes. But tools also shape us.”\\n  Reason: Split for emphasis; “also” signals concession then contrast, improving flow.\\n\\n- Solution: “3 steps: grayscale, no-phone mornings, buddy check-ins.” → “Three steps: turn on grayscale, try no-phone mornings, and set up buddy check-ins.”\\n  Reason: Spell out numbers in speech; use parallel imperative phrases to make the plan actionable.\\n\\n- Close: “You deserve your attention back.” Ask audience to try it for 7 days. → “You deserve your attention back. Try it for seven days.”\\n  Reason: Keep the impactful sentence; make the call to action direct; spell out “seven.”\\n\\nWould you like me to generate a full speech script based on this outline (about 900–1,000 words for 5–6 minutes)?

I didn’t change it because it might be true to your experience.\\n\\n3) Original: “Later, in physical therapy, I learn patience I didn’t know I had.”\\n   Suggested edit: “Later, in physical therapy, I learned patience I didn’t know I had.”\\n   Reasoning:\\n   - “Learned” keeps the narrative in past tense.\\n   - The rest of the sentence reads well and supports the reflective tone.\\n\\n4) Original: “By spring I was jogging, then I am running.”\\n   Suggested edit: “By spring, I was jogging; then I was running.”\\n   Reasoning:\\n   - Make both verbs past tense for consistency.\\n   - Use a semicolon to add sentence variety and show progression.\\n   - Keep “then” to maintain your original timeline without adding specifics.\\n\\n5) Original: “Joining track taught me to measure progress in millimeters before it shows up as miles.”\\n   Suggested edit (Option A, fully past tense): “Joining track taught me to measure progress in millimeters before it showed up as miles.”\\n   Suggested edit (Option B, reflective present perfect): “Joining track has taught me to measure progress in millimeters before it shows up as miles.”\\n   Reasoning:\\n   - Option A keeps the entire piece in past tense.\\n   - Option B shifts to present reflection at the end, which can feel more hopeful and ongoing. Choose based on your preference and teacher guidelines.\\n\\nStructural Suggestions\\n- Keep this as one cohesive paragraph for a portfolio, but ensure the chronology is crystal clear:\\n  1) Hook with the ankle-break/decision sentence.\\n  2) Describe the fall (winter → stairs → invisible ice → fall).\\n  3) Move to physical therapy and the patience lesson.\\n  4) Mark progress (spring → jogging → running).\\n  5) Conclude with the broader takeaway about measuring progress (either in past tense or present perfect).\\n- Consider adding one brief transition phrase between therapy and spring to smooth the time jump, e.g., “After weeks of exercises,” only if it’s accurate to your experience. If not, the current “By spring…” works.\\n- If you expand this for a longer essay, split into two paragraphs: (1) incident and decision; (2) recovery and lesson.\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement\\n- Clarify “limping”: If you were limping before the fall, a brief clarification would prevent confusion. If you weren’t, consider “walking carefully” or “moving slowly” (only if true).\\n- Add one reflective phrase to deepen the hopeful tone without inventing events, e.g., “steady, patient steps” or “small gains that mattered”—only if these match your experience.\\n- Vary sentence openings to avoid repetition (start one sentence with a time phrase, another with a participial phrase, etc.). The edits above already introduce some of this variety.\\n\\nFormatting Guidance\\n- For a standard essay paragraph in a portfolio:\\n  - Use Times New Roman or a similar serif font, 12-point, double-spaced, with 1-inch margins.\\n  - Indent the first line of the paragraph.\\n  - Keep consistent tense choice: either all past, or past with a final present-perfect reflection.\\n  - Include a strong concluding sentence that ties the learning to your growth as a student/athlete.\\n\\nWould you like me to rewrite the paragraph with these edits applied? I can provide two versions (all past tense vs. ending in present perfect) so you can choose which fits your portfolio.\\n\\nIf helpful now, here are both edited versions:\\n\\nVersion A (all past tense):\\n“The day I broke my ankle was the day I decided to join track—a choice that makes more sense once I explain. Last winter, I was limping down the stairs when I hit invisible ice, and I fell. Later, in physical therapy, I learned patience I didn’t know I had. By spring, I was jogging; then I was running. Joining track taught me to measure progress in millimeters before it showed up as miles.”\\n\\nVersion B (ending in present reflection):\\n“The day I broke my ankle was the day I decided to join track—a choice that makes more sense once I explain. Last winter, I was limping down the stairs when I hit invisible ice, and I fell. Later, in physical therapy, I learned patience I didn’t know I had. By spring, I was jogging; then I was running. Joining track has taught me to measure progress in millimeters before it shows up as miles.”\\n\\nLet me know which you prefer, and if you want me to tweak “limping” based on what’s accurate to your experience or adjust tone further toward reflective/hopeful.\",\n    \"metrics\": {\n      \"groundtruth-eval with azure:o4-mini_2025-04-16\": {\n        \"content\": \"{\\\"explanation\\\":\\\"Headings not exact\\\",\\\"score\\\":90}\",\n        \"score\": 90\n      }\n    },\n    \"compliance\": \"ok\",\n    \"complianceText\": \"The output fully aligns with the prescribed structure—asking about goals, giving an overview, categorized feedback (Overall, Spelling, Grammar, Structural, Opportunities, Formatting), line-by-line edits with reasoning, positive tone, and offering revised versions.  \\nOK\",\n    \"isGroundtruth\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"5f00551\",\n    \"promptid\": \"b7651b1\",\n    \"ruleid\": null,\n    \"testuid\": \"baseline-test-j3oqtofzr\",\n    \"scenario\": \"\",\n    \"baseline\": true,\n    \"testinput\": \"goals: Make the email polite and clear; fix grammar and formatting; suggest structure for a professional request\\ntype_of_writing: email requesting assignment extension\\ntarget_audience: college professor\\nfeedback_focus: line-by-line edits with reasoning; structural suggestions; formatting guidance (subject, greeting, closing)\\nformatting: professional email\\ntone_preferences: respectful, concise, transparent\\nconstraints: keep dates; no excuses, just brief context\\ntext: Subject: Extension for Research Brief Due Sept 28\\nHi Professor Ahmed,\\nI am requesting a 48 hour extension for the research brief due Sept 28.

Optional: “the way it helped me organise my thoughts” can sound slightly more formal than “how,” but both are fine.\\n   - Optional tense alignment (if you want immediacy): “I’ve realised that my favourite part of the programme is the way it helps me organise my thoughts.” This shifts to present-perfect and present tense to emphasise a current insight.\\n\\n2) “It wasn’t glamorous, but the colour-coded cards made revision feel possible again.”\\n   - Correct use of comma before “but” to join two independent clauses.\\n   - Optional word choice: “achievable” or “manageable” may be slightly stronger than “possible,” as they imply practicality rather than mere possibility.\\n\\n3) “If I can keep this habit, I’ll be more consistent next term.”\\n   - Correct comma after the introductory clause.\\n   - If you mean commitment rather than ability, consider: “If I keep this habit, I’ll be more consistent next term.” Using “can” emphasises ability; omitting it emphasises intention.\\n\\nStructural Suggestions\\n- For a short reflective paragraph, your three-sentence structure is effective: past insight → practical method → forward-looking goal.\\n- If you prefer a tighter tense flow, consider making all sentences present-focused: “I’ve realised… It isn’t… If I keep…”. This presents the reflection as current and ongoing. Otherwise, the original past-to-future progression is perfectly fine.\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement\\n- Strengthen specificity slightly: “colour-coded cards” could briefly note purpose (e.g., “colour-coded cue cards for topics and formulas”) if you want to show method, but this is optional given the paragraph’s brevity.\\n- Word choice: swap “possible” for “achievable” or “manageable” to underscore practicality.\\n\\nFormatting Guidance (UK conventions)\\n- Paragraph length: one compact paragraph is appropriate; keep it to 3–5 sentences for clarity.\\n- Hyphenation: “colour-coded” is correctly hyphenated as a compound adjective before the noun.\\n- Apostrophes: “wasn’t” and “I’ll” are correctly contracted; use smart (curly) apostrophes if typesetting permits, but straight apostrophes are fine for plain text.\\n- Quotation marks: use single quotes for quoted words/phrases if needed (UK convention), though none are required here.\\n- Spacing and punctuation: one space after full stops; avoid extra spaces before commas/full stops.\\n- Maintain -ise/-yse spellings consistently in future writing (organise, analyse) to match UK preference.\\n\\nWould you like anything else?\\n- Would you like me to keep the original tense, or rewrite with the present-perfect immediacy?\\n- Do you prefer “achievable” or “manageable” instead of “possible”?\\n\\nOffer to generate the edited text\\n- Minimal-edit version (keeping your tone and structure, with one optional word choice):\\n  “I realised that my favourite part of the programme was how it helped me organise my thoughts.

To strengthen the analytical tone, clarify the thesis so it indicates your criteria and the conditional judgment (e.g., convenience vs deep reading).\\n- Eliminate comma splices by using colons/semicolons appropriately or by splitting into separate sentences.\\n- Tighten phrasing and make subject references explicit (“it loses meaning” → “the highlighting loses its meaning”).\\n\\nSpelling Edits\\n- ebooks → e-books\\n  Reason: Hyphenation is standard in formal writing when “e-” is used as a prefix.\\n- don’t → do not\\n  Reason: MLA essays generally avoid contractions for a more formal tone.\\n\\nGrammar Edits (line-by-line with reasoning)\\n1) Original: “While ebooks are convenient because you can carry many in one device, print books have advantages too, they are easier on the eyes and don’t need batteries.”\\n   Edited: “While e-books are convenient because you can carry many on one device, print books also have advantages: they are easier on the eyes and do not need batteries.”\\n   Why: \\n   - Changed “ebooks” to “e-books” (spelling/formality).\\n   - “in one device” → “on one device” (correct preposition).\\n   - “print books have advantages too, they are…” was a comma splice. Replaced with a colon to introduce the list of advantages.\\n   - Removed contraction for MLA formality.\\n\\n2) Original: “Also I think annotations feel different, on a screen I highlight too much and it loses meaning, with paper I slow down more.”\\n   Edited: “Also, annotations feel different: on a screen, I tend to highlight too much, and the highlighting loses its meaning; with paper, I slow down more.”\\n   Why:\\n   - Comma after the introductory adverb “Also.”\\n   - Removed “I think” to reduce hedging and strengthen the analytical tone.\\n   - Used a colon to introduce examples and a semicolon to link two closely related independent clauses (avoids run-ons).\\n   - Clarified the vague pronoun “it” to “the highlighting,” improving precision.\\n\\n3) Original: “Both formats can be good but it depends on the reader and the situation.”\\n   Edited: “Ultimately, both formats can be effective, but the better choice depends on the reader and the purpose.”\\n   Why:\\n   - Added “Ultimately” for a concluding signal.\\n   - Inserted a comma before “but” to separate independent clauses.\\n   - “effective” is slightly more formal than “good.”\\n   - “purpose” is more specific than “situation,” supporting analytical comparison.\\n\\nStructural Suggestions (compare/contrast)\\n- Point-by-point is ideal for your criteria-driven comparison. Suggested outline:\\n  - Thesis: Establish conditional judgment based on purpose (portability vs deep reading).\\n  - Point 1: Portability — e-books excel; print books are limited.\\n  - Point 2: Readability/eye comfort — print books often easier on the eyes; screens can strain.\\n  - Point 3: Annotation — screen highlighting can become excessive; paper slows you down and adds focus.\\n  - Point 4: Power dependence — e-books require batteries; print books do not.\\n  - Conclusion: The preferable format depends on whether the goal is quick access or sustained, attentive reading.\\n- Block structure (all e-book points, then all print points) can work for longer essays, but with your focused criteria, point-by-point will keep comparisons clear and analytical.\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement\\n- Strengthen the thesis to name the criteria and the conditional choice (e.g., convenience vs comprehension).\\n- Maintain parallelism when listing advantages (e.g., “easier on the eyes and independent of batteries”).\\n- Consider reducing first-person if your teacher prefers objectivity: “On screens, highlighting often becomes excessive…” instead of “I highlight too much.”\\n- Vary sentence starts (not all with “Also” or “Ultimately”) and use transitions like “Moreover,” “In contrast,” “However.”\\n\\nFormatting Guidance (MLA basics)\\n- Use 12-point Times New Roman, double-spaced, 1-inch margins.\\n- Header: Your Name, Teacher’s Name, Course, Date (in day month year), top left.\\n- Page numbers: Last name and page number in the upper right header.\\n- Title: Centered, standard capitalization, no bold/underline.\\n- Avoid contractions; use present tense consistently for general comparisons.\\n- No sources needed here—so no in-text citations or Works Cited for this excerpt.\\n\\nWould you like me to keep first-person examples or shift them to a more objective tone?\\n\\nEdited text options\\n\\nOption A: Minimal changes (keeps your voice)\\n- “While e-books are convenient because you can carry many on one device, print books also have advantages: they are easier on the eyes and do not need batteries. Also, annotations feel different: on a screen, I tend to highlight too much, and the highlighting loses its meaning; with paper, I slow down more. Ultimately, both formats can be effective, but the better choice depends on the reader and the purpose.”\\n\\nOption B: More formal, thesis-forward (reduced first-person)\\n- “While e-books offer superior portability, print books provide greater eye comfort and require no batteries. Annotations also differ across formats: on screens, highlighting often becomes excessive and loses its meaning, whereas paper annotation encourages a slower, more attentive pace.

I’ll focus on fixing punctuation and capitalization, improving clarity and concision, keeping quotes verbatim, and ensuring respectful, AP-style presentation for school newspaper readers.\\n\\nQuick check: Would you like to keep the courtesy title “Ms.” (common in school papers) or follow strict AP style and use the last name only (“Johnson”)? Also, do you want to include her first name anywhere?\\n\\nOverview of the approach\\n- Line-by-line edits focused on punctuation, capitalization, clarity, and concision, with reasoning for each change.\\n- Respectful wording for references to backgrounds and abilities.\\n- AP-style guidance for quotes, attribution, titles, numbers, and hyphenation.\\n- Structural suggestions to strengthen the article’s flow for a community profile.\\n\\nOverall Feedback\\n- Your piece has a clear, positive tone, a strong quote, and a vivid closing image. To improve readability and professionalism for a school newspaper, tighten sentences, avoid comma splices, use precise terms (e.g., “technology” instead of “tech”), and maintain consistent tense. Format the quotes in AP style while keeping the interviewee’s words verbatim.\\n- Consider adding a brief context sentence (school name, when the club started, meeting details) to help readers understand the club’s impact.\\n\\nSpelling Edits\\n- “tech” → “technology”\\n  - Reason: “technology” is more formal and appropriate for a school newspaper; “tech” reads as colloquial.\\n- “after-school” is correctly hyphenated. No change needed.\\n- “app” is acceptable in AP style. No change needed.\\n\\nGrammar Edits (line-by-line with suggested revisions and reasoning)\\n1) Original: “Ms. Johnson, a veteran and math teacher, started the after-school coding club to help students who felt left out of tech.”\\n   - Suggested: “Ms. Johnson, a veteran and math teacher, started the after-school coding club to support students who feel left out of technology.”\\n   - Reasoning: “Support” is concise and respectful; “feel” maintains present-tense for an ongoing situation; “technology” is more formal than “tech.”\\n\\n2) Original (quote): “Everybody can learn to code,” she said, “we just need a place to try and fail safely.”\\n   - Suggested formatting (keeping words verbatim): “Everybody can learn to code,” she said. “We just need a place to try and fail safely.”\\n   - Reasoning: Breaks a comma splice into two sentences, which is clearer and follows AP-style quoting with attribution.\\n\\n3) Original: “The club has students from different backgrounds and abilities and they pair up to solve small problems.”\\n   - Suggested: “The club includes students with diverse backgrounds and abilities, and members pair up to solve small problems.”\\n   - Reasoning: “Includes” is more precise; “with diverse backgrounds and abilities” improves parallel structure and tone; “members” avoids repetitive “they” and clarifies who pairs up.\\n\\n4) Original: “Last week they built an app that shows bus schedules, it was buggy but then they fixed it together.”\\n   - Suggested: “Last week, they built an app that shows bus schedules. It was buggy at first, but they fixed it together.”\\n   - Reasoning: Fixes a comma splice by making two sentences; adds a comma after the introductory phrase; “at first” is concise and improves flow.\\n\\n5) Original: “The room feels like a lab and a living room at once.”\\n   - Suggested: “The room feels like both a lab and a living room.”\\n   - Reasoning: “Both … and …” is concise and clearer than “at once.”\\n\\nStructural Suggestions\\n- Lead/nut graf: Add one sentence at the top with school name and a brief purpose (“The coding club at [School Name], started in [semester/year], welcomes students who want to explore programming in a supportive setting.”).\\n- Context: Consider one sentence explaining how often the club meets or the number of participants (AP style: use numerals for 10 and above).\\n- Flow: Current sequence works well—introduction → quote → description → example → image. The example (“bus schedules” app) nicely shows collaboration; keep it immediately after the quote for impact.\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement\\n- Attribution variety: After first mention, use “Johnson said” instead of “she said” to align with AP style and clarity (especially if multiple speakers appear later).\\n- Specifics: If available, add details like meeting times (“Wednesdays after school”), location (room number), or outcomes (e.g., whether the app is used by students). This deepens the profile without changing the quotes.\\n- Respectful portrayal: “Diverse backgrounds and abilities” is good; avoid phrasing that implies deficit (e.g., “struggling kids”). Your current language is respectful—just keep it consistent.\\n\\nFormatting Guidance (AP style)\\n- Quotes and attribution:\\n  - Use double quotation marks.\\n  - Place periods and commas inside quotation marks.\\n  - Preferred format when splitting a quote: “Sentence,” Johnson said. “Second sentence.”\\n  - Keep the interviewee’s words exactly as spoken; you may break long quotes around the attribution without changing the words.\\n- Courtesy titles:\\n  - AP style typically avoids courtesy titles; use “Johnson” after first reference. If your school’s style uses “Ms.” for teachers, keep it consistently.\\n- Numbers:\\n  - Spell out one through nine; use numerals for 10 and above.\\n  - Use numerals for time and dates (e.g., 3 p.m., Sept. 21).\\n- Hyphenation:\\n  - “after-school” is hyphenated when used as a compound modifier (“after-school coding club”).\\n- Job descriptions:\\n  - Lowercase generic titles after names (“math teacher”) unless used before a name as a formal title (e.g., “Principal Maria Lopez”).\\n- Composition:\\n  - Keep paragraphs concise; one to three sentences per graf is fine for school newspaper style.\\n\\nWould you like me to incorporate these edits into a clean, AP-style version?\\n\\nProposed edited version (quotes kept verbatim):\\nMs. Johnson, a veteran and math teacher, started the after-school coding club to support students who feel left out of technology. “Everybody can learn to code,” she said. “We just need a place to try and fail safely.” The club includes students with diverse backgrounds and abilities, and members pair up to solve small problems. Last week, they built an app that shows bus schedules. It was buggy at first, but they fixed it together.

I’m here to help you edit and improve your writing. I can give line-by-line edits on spelling, grammar, phrasing, and structure, and I can also suggest how to organize your ideas for your audience.\\n\\nA few quick questions to understand your goals:\\n- How long do you want the paragraph to be (one short paragraph or a few)?\\n- Do you want it to be informative, persuasive, or both?\\n- Should it focus on farmers in a specific region, or be general?\\n- Do you plan to include data/statistics, or keep it high-level?\\n\\nOverview of the approach:\\n- I’ll clean up grammar and spelling, tighten phrasing, and make the weather–climate connection clear.\\n- I’ll suggest a simple structure: a clear topic sentence, 1–2 supporting points (examples or data), and a concise concluding idea.\\n- I’ll offer a polished version you can use or adapt.\\n\\nOverall Feedback:\\n- You’re flagging a timely topic and a clear audience. To make this effective for the general public, avoid meta statements (like “I was going to add more later”) in the final paragraph, and connect weather impacts directly to climate change so the cause-and-effect relationship is clear.\\n- Aim for specific examples (droughts, floods, unpredictable seasons) and simple, direct language.\\n- Keep tense consistent and avoid filler phrases (“kind of,” “a lot”) unless they add meaning.\\n\\nSpelling Edits (with explanations):\\n- “effecting” → “affecting”\\n  - “Affecting” means “influencing or having an impact on.” “Effecting” means “causing to happen,” which isn’t the intended meaning here.\\n- “alot” → “a lot”\\n  - “A lot” is two words in standard English.\\n- “its good” → “it’s good”\\n  - Use “it’s” (it is). “Its” is possessive.\\n\\nGrammar and Phrasing Edits (with explanations):\\n- Original: “Weather is effecting farmers alot.”\\n  - Suggested: “Extreme weather is affecting farmers a lot.”\\n  - Why: Correct spelling and verb; add “Extreme” to be more precise. Consider replacing “a lot” with “significantly” or describing how (e.g., “by reducing yields and raising costs”) for specificity.\\n- Original: “The data are scattered and I was going to add more later.”\\n  - Suggested (general public style): “The available data are scattered, and I plan to add more later.”\\n  - Why: “Plan” keeps tense consistent; “available” clarifies what’s scattered. For a finished essay, remove meta-process notes entirely and present one or two specific data points instead.\\n- Original: “It’s kind of messy, and I don’t know if its good.”\\n  - Suggested: “It’s a bit messy, and I’m not sure it reads well.”\\n  - Why: Replace filler (“kind of”) with “a bit,” correct “it’s,” and be specific about what “good” means (clarity/readability). For the final essay, avoid self-assessment and simply present a clean paragraph.\\n\\nStructural Suggestions:\\n- Use a clear 3–4 sentence structure:\\n  1) Topic sentence: connect climate change to weather and farmers.\\n  2) Supporting detail: examples of impacts (droughts, floods, unpredictable seasons).\\n  3) Optional evidence: one clear statistic or observed trend (cite a credible source if you have one).\\n  4) Closing sentence: why it matters or what should happen next (adaptation/support/emissions reductions).\\n- Remove meta commentary (“I was going to add more later”) from the final paragraph. Keep that note in your draft, not in the published text.\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement:\\n- Replace vague phrases (“a lot,” “kind of messy”) with concrete examples.\\n- Clarify the weather–climate link (e.g., “Climate change is intensifying extreme weather…”).\\n- If you include data, choose one or two key numbers with plain-language context and a source.\\n- Use active voice and short sentences to increase readability.\\n\\nFormatting Guidance:\\n- For a short general-public essay, stick to one concise paragraph (3–5 sentences).\\n- Use plain language, avoid jargon, and define terms briefly if needed (e.g., “extreme weather”).\\n- If you expand to multiple paragraphs, add a short subheading and break up ideas for readability.\\n\\nWould you like me to rewrite this into a clean, ready-to-share paragraph now?

Here’s a neutral, general-public example you could use or tweak:\\n\\nExample revised paragraph:\\nClimate change is intensifying extreme weather, and farmers are feeling the effects. Droughts, floods, and unpredictable seasons reduce yields and raise costs, making harvests less reliable and food prices more volatile. Clear, consistent data help us understand these trends, but the takeaway is already clear: we need to support farmers’ adaptation efforts while reducing emissions to limit future damage.\\n\\nIf you share your target length and any data you want included, I can tailor this further and provide a fully edited version.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"ruleid\": \"2\",\n    \"testid\": \"1\",\n    \"expectedoutput\": \"Contains a distinct section labeled 'Overview' that briefly summarizes the editorial approach and focus areas based on the provided goals and type (argumentative essay).\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"None; input adheres to specification; includes stated goals, type, and target audience for alignment.\",\n    \"user_input\": \"goal: strengthen thesis clarity and persuasive impact type: argumentative essay audience: high school teacher feedback: line-by-line edits and overview text: School uniforms should be adopted because they reduce bullying.

If you want a planning sentence, you can instead write: “This essay explains how uniforms curb bullying and supports the claim with evidence from schools and research.” But typically, just use a clear thesis and let the body paragraphs provide support.\\n\\n3) Original: “I want stronger transitions and a clearer stance.”\\n   Suggested edit: Remove from the essay.\\n   Why: Also meta-commentary. Replace with an actual clear stance (the revised thesis) and use transitions within and between body paragraphs.\\n\\nOverall Feedback:\\n- Your core claim is solid, but it needs a stronger, more specific thesis that states how uniforms reduce bullying (the mechanism) and previews the points you’ll argue.\\n- Remove self-referential sentences from the draft; replace them with argumentative content.\\n- Use consistent, active voice and topic sentences that directly support the thesis.\\n- Integrate transitions that show logical progression: begin with mechanism, move to evidence, then address counterarguments before concluding.\\n\\nSpelling Edits:\\n- No spelling errors in your text.\\n\\nGrammar Edits:\\n- Add a comma after introductory “However” if you keep that sentence in any future draft: “However, …”\\n- Prefer active voice (“schools should require”) over passive (“should be adopted”) for a stronger, more persuasive tone.\\n- Avoid first-person meta-statements in an argumentative essay unless your assignment encourages reflection.\\n\\nStructural Suggestions:\\n- Introduction: Hook, brief context, precise thesis.\\n- Body paragraph 1 (Mechanism): Explain how uniforms reduce visible status markers and remove appearance-based targets for bullying.\\n- Body paragraph 2 (Evidence): Present examples or data from school districts or studies showing reduced bullying incidents after uniform adoption.\\n- Body paragraph 3 (Counterargument and rebuttal): Acknowledge concerns (cost, individuality) and rebut with solutions (assistance programs, optional accessories, focus on safety).\\n- Conclusion: Restate thesis in fresh words, synthesize key points, and end with a call to action or implication (e.g., schools should pilot uniform policies with equity supports).\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement:\\n- Define bullying briefly (appearance-based teasing, brand shaming) to focus your claim.\\n- Specify the scope (e.g., public middle and high schools) to avoid overgeneralization.\\n- Support claims with credible sources (district reports, education research) or real-world examples; avoid overclaiming causation without evidence.\\n- Use clear topic sentences that tie directly back to the thesis at the start of each body paragraph.\\n- Maintain parallel structure when listing reasons: “reduces status competition, removes appearance-based targets, and fosters a sense of belonging.”\\n\\nFormatting Guidance:\\n- Use a standard argumentative format: double-spaced, readable font, clear paragraph breaks, and consistent heading style if required by your teacher.\\n- If citing sources, include in-text citations and a works cited page (MLA is common for high school).\\n- Keep paragraphs focused: one main idea per paragraph with a strong topic sentence and concluding link back to the thesis.\\n\\nStronger thesis options (choose one or adapt):\\n- “Public schools should require uniforms because standardizing dress reduces status competition, removes appearance-based targets for bullying, and builds a culture of belonging.”\\n- “To make campuses safer, schools should require uniforms; by removing visible status markers, uniforms cut the fuel for bullying and refocus attention on learning.”\\n- “Schools should adopt uniforms to reduce bullying: when clothing is standardized, students have fewer reasons to judge, isolate, or harass peers over appearance or brand.”\\n\\nSample introduction paragraph (ready to use or adapt):\\n- “No student should dread walking into school because of what they wear. Bullying often targets appearance—brands, styles, and price tags become excuses to judge and exclude. Schools should require uniforms because standardizing dress reduces status competition and appearance-based bullying. By removing visible markers that separate students into ‘haves’ and ‘have-nots,’ uniforms help create a more respectful environment where attention can return to learning.”\\n\\nSample topic sentences and transitions:\\n- Body 1: “First, uniforms reduce status competition by eliminating the brand and style differences that often trigger teasing.”\\n- Body 2: “Moreover, schools that adopt uniform policies report fewer appearance-based conflicts, suggesting uniforms help curb bullying.”\\n- Body 3 (counterargument): “Critics argue that uniforms limit self-expression and can be costly; however, schools can allow personal accessories and provide assistance programs, maintaining safety without sacrificing equity.”\\n- Conclusion: “Ultimately, by removing appearance-based targets and promoting belonging, uniforms are a practical step schools can take to reduce bullying.”\\n\\nWould you like me to rewrite your thesis, introduction, and an outline for the full essay based on your assignment length and requirements?

Professional readers prefer clear value statements and a specific next step.\\n- Replace outdated or impersonal salutations (“Dear Sir or Madam”) with a name or role-based greeting.\\n- Remove or shorten cliché openers (“I hope this email finds you well”) to keep the message concise and professional.\\n- Make the call to action specific (e.g., propose a time for a call or invite them to request a proposal).\\n\\nSpelling Edits\\n- “Please let me know if you have any question.” → “Please let me know if you have any questions.”\\n  Reason: “Questions” should be plural when referring to any number of potential questions.\\n\\nGrammar Edits\\n- “We offer services that is tailored to your needs” → “We offer services that are tailored to your needs”\\n  Reason: Subject–verb agreement. “Services” is plural, so use “are.”\\n- “...and we want to ensure your satisfaction, we will be happy to help.” → Split into two sentences or use a coordinating conjunction.\\n  Reason: Comma splice. Two independent clauses joined by a comma should be separated by a period, semicolon, or conjunction.\\n- Pronoun consistency: You switch from “we” to “me” in the last sentence.\\n  Suggestion: Use “we” throughout if writing on behalf of the company, or “I” if writing as a representative.\\n\\nStructural Suggestions\\n- Use a clear, direct opener that states your value: what you do and why it matters to the client.\\n- Follow with a brief assurance or benefit (commitment to satisfaction).\\n- End with a specific call to action (propose a meeting, invite a reply, provide contact details).\\n- If this is a letter, include a professional sign-off and full contact details.

I help edit writing line by line and give clear, constructive feedback on tone, clarity, grammar, structure, and formatting. Before we dive in, two quick questions to tailor the feedback:\\n- What is your central message in one sentence (for example: “Curiosity drives me to explore biology through hands-on problem solving”)?\\n- Which specific anecdotes are you considering (e.g., a lab project, fieldwork, a challenge you overcame)? And what word count are you targeting?\\n\\nOverview of the approach\\n- I’ll give precise line-by-line edits of the text you shared, with reasoning.\\n- I’ll then provide categorized feedback on tone, concision, authenticity, and structure tailored to a college admissions audience.\\n- I’ll suggest how to link anecdotes to your central message and keep the tone confident yet humble.\\n- If you want, I can draft a revised opening or the full personal statement after we discuss your anecdotes.\\n\\nLine-by-line edits with reasoning\\n1) Original: “Growing up in a small town taught me resilience and curiosity.”\\n   - Edited: “Growing up in a small town shaped my resilience and curiosity.”\\n   - Reasoning: “Shaped” is more concise and feels less cliché than “taught me,” while still showing growth. Consider replacing abstract traits (“resilience,” “curiosity”) with a concrete detail later (e.g., a specific moment or habit) to convey authenticity.\\n\\n2) Original: “I want to show my passion for biology without sounding arrogant.”\\n   - Edited: “I aim to convey my passion for biology with humility.”\\n   - Reasoning: Positive framing (“convey … with humility”) is concise and avoids the meta “show” language. In the essay itself, don’t state this intent—demonstrate it through choices, actions, and reflective insight.\\n\\n3) Original: “I’m not sure if my anecdotes connect to my central message or if the tone fits my audience.”\\n   - Edited: “I’m working to ensure my anecdotes reinforce a clear central message and suit a college admissions audience.”\\n   - Reasoning: More assertive and concise (“working to ensure” + “reinforce a clear central message”). In the essay, replace uncertainty with clear transitions and reflective sentences that explicitly tie each anecdote to your message.\\n\\nOverall Feedback\\n- Authenticity: Avoid general claims (“resilience,” “curiosity”) unless you ground them in vivid, specific moments. Specifics make you memorable and humble.\\n- Concision: Replace meta statements (what you want to show) with actions and reflection. Trim filler (“I want to,” “I’m not sure if”) and use strong verbs.\\n- Tone for admissions: Confident, reflective, and collaborative. Show impact on others or learning from setbacks. Avoid grandiose language and excessive self-praise.\\n- Connection: After each anecdote, include a 1–2 sentence reflection that ties it back to your central message and forward to your future goals in biology.\\n\\nSpelling Edits\\n- No spelling errors in the lines you shared.\\n- Note: “college admissions committee” is your audience; if you reference them, use “college admissions readers” or “the admissions committee” for clarity and consistency.\\n\\nGrammar Edits\\n- Strengthen verb choice: “shaped” or “cultivated” instead of “taught me” for a smoother, less didactic tone.\\n- Avoid meta phrasing: Instead of “I want to show,” demonstrate through a specific example and reflective insight.\\n- Parallel structure: When you list two aims (“connect to my central message” and “fit my audience”), make them parallel—e.g., “reinforce a clear central message and suit a college admissions audience.”\\n\\nStructural Suggestions\\n- Suggested outline for a concise, authentic personal statement (650 words max):\\n  1) Hook: A specific moment that reveals curiosity or resilience (one vivid image or action).\\n  2) Pivot: Brief context—small-town background—without clichés; tie the moment to your values.\\n  3) Biology Focus: One or two concrete experiences (experiment, project, fieldwork). Use sensory or technical details sparingly to show competence.\\n  4) Reflection: What you learned (intellectual growth, ethics, collaboration, humility). This is where you keep tone grounded and avoid arrogance.\\n  5) Impact and Future: How these experiences shape what you hope to explore in college biology (not name-dropping programs yet, just direction).\\n  6) Closing: Return to the opening image or idea, showing continuity and purpose.\\n\\n- How to connect anecdotes:\\n  - After each anecdote, add a reflection sentence starting with “This taught me…” or “I realized…” then end with a forward-looking line: “Because of this, I now…” This explicitly ties the story to the central message and your trajectory.\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement\\n- Replace abstractions with specifics: One concrete detail (equipment used, problem solved, a question you asked) communicates more than labels.\\n- Show humility through process: Include a small failure or misconception you corrected. Admissions readers value teachability.\\n- Use active verbs: “analyzed,” “cultured,” “designed,” “mentored,” “iterated” instead of passive phrasing.\\n- Limit themes: Focus on 1–2 core ideas (e.g., curiosity + collaborative problem-solving). Too many themes dilute impact.\\n- Audience fit: Emphasize learning, ethics, and collaboration over prestige or competition.\\n\\nFormatting Guidance\\n- Common App essays: Plain text; paragraph breaks are preserved, but extra formatting (bold/italics) is not. Aim for 3–5 short paragraphs.\\n- Keep line lengths readable; avoid long blocks of text. Use a clear, simple font when drafting (for your own readability).\\n- No title needed unless it genuinely adds meaning; you can start directly with the hook.\\n- Avoid quotation-heavy openings; one brief, concrete sentence is stronger than a long setup.\\n\\nWould you like further assistance?\\n- If you share your draft and the specific anecdotes, I can provide detailed line-by-line edits and tighten the prose while preserving your voice.\\n- I can also draft a revised opening paragraph that balances authenticity and humility.\\n\\nOffer to generate edited text\\n- If helpful, I can turn your three meta sentences into a concise thesis-style opening you could adapt:\\n  - “Raised in a town where answers weren’t handed to me, I learned to ask better questions. That habit now shapes how I approach biology—curious, persistent, and grounded in what I can learn from mistakes.”\\n- Or, send your full draft, and I’ll rewrite it incorporating all suggested changes.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"ruleid\": \"5\",\n    \"testid\": \"1\",\n    \"expectedoutput\": \"In 'Spelling Edits', itemized bullet points identify each misspelling from the text, supply the corrected spelling, and explain the reason for each correction.\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"None; input complies; includes multiple realistic misspellings to test itemized corrections.\",\n    \"user_input\": \"goal: fix spelling errors and polish tone type: cover letter audience: hiring manager feedback: spelling-focused text: I am definately interested in the position and hope to recieve a response soon.

(For example, in US English “team” is usually singular—“the team was”—while UK English often uses plural—“the team were.”) Also, would you like minimal edits only, or a slightly polished rewrite for clarity?\\n\\nOverview of what I’ll do\\n- Focus on grammar, tense consistency, subject–verb agreement, modifiers, and punctuation.\\n- Keep your reflective tone and make phrasing clear and idiomatic for a teacher audience.\\n- Provide line-by-line edits with reasons, then offer a clean revised version if you want it.\\n\\nOverall Feedback\\n- Your ideas are clear and sequential: you present a result, describe work and effort, and end with team celebration.\\n- The main grammar issues are subject–verb agreement, inconsistent tense, a dangling modifier, and a comma splice.\\n- A few phrases can be made more idiomatic and precise (e.g., “successful in the project” → “successful on the project” or “successful in completing the project”).\\n\\nSpelling Edits\\n- No spelling errors detected.\\n\\nGrammar Edits (line-by-line with explanations)\\n1) Original: “The results shows that I was successful in the project.”\\n   - Edit: “The results show that I was successful on the project.”\\n   - Why: “Results” is plural, so use “show,” not “shows.” “Successful on the project” is more idiomatic than “successful in the project.” Alternative: “The results show that I was successful in completing the project,” which is even clearer.\\n\\n2) Original: “I was working on the report and finish it yesterday.”\\n   - Edit (simple past for consistency): “I worked on the report and finished it yesterday.”\\n   - Why: Keep the same tense within the sentence. “Yesterday” calls for simple past. “Was working … finished” can work, but the mismatch (“was working” vs. “finish”) is incorrect; if you keep the progressive, make it “was working … and finished.”\\n\\n3) Original: “Running quickly, the finish line seemed far.”\\n   - Edit: “While I was running quickly, the finish line seemed far away.”\\n   - Why: The original has a dangling modifier—“Running quickly” needs to modify “I,” not “the finish line.” Adding “away” is the natural collocation with “far.”\\n\\n4) Original: “The team were excited, we celebrated and it was great.”\\n   - US English edit: “The team was excited. We celebrated, and it was great.”\\n   - UK English edit: “The team were excited. We celebrated, and it was great.”\\n   - Why: Fix the comma splice by splitting into two sentences or using a semicolon. In US English, “team” is treated as singular (“was”); in UK English, plural (“were”). Keeping “it was great” is acceptable, though you could make it more specific (e.g., “and it felt great” or “and it was a rewarding moment”).\\n\\nStructural Suggestions\\n- Consider linking the metaphor (“finish line”) more directly to the project for coherence: e.g., “Even though I was moving quickly to meet the deadline, the ‘finish line’ still felt far away.”\\n- You can combine related ideas for smoother flow: for instance, connect success to the effort and celebration:\\n  - “The results show that I was successful on the project. I worked on the report and finished it yesterday. While I was running quickly, the finish line still seemed far away, but in the end the team was excited. We celebrated, and it felt great.”\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement\\n- Replace vague phrasing like “it was great” with a more specific reflection (e.g., “It felt rewarding to see our hard work pay off”).\\n- Clarify the timeline: if “running quickly” is a metaphor for working toward the deadline, say so explicitly.\\n- Keep tense consistent throughout (past tense for completed actions).\\n\\nFormatting Guidance\\n- For a reflective essay to a teacher, use first person consistently and past tense for completed events.\\n- Aim for paragraph form with clear transitions (e.g., “First,” “Later,” “In the end”).\\n- Avoid comma splices; join independent clauses with a period, semicolon, or a coordinating conjunction with a comma.\\n\\nWould you like me to produce a clean, edited version now? I can provide:\\n- US English version\\n- UK English version\\n- Minimal changes vs. slightly more polished for clarity\\n\\nIf you confirm your preference, I’ll rewrite the paragraph accordingly.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"ruleid\": \"7\",\n    \"testid\": \"1\",\n    \"expectedoutput\": \"Every suggested change includes an explanation naming the issue type (e.g., spelling, grammar, style, structure) and a concise rationale for the change.\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"None; input complies; includes mixed issues to verify explanations with named issue types.\",\n    \"user_input\": \"goal: comprehensive improvements type: analytical essay audience: classmates feedback: thorough edits text: The experiment was sucssesful but kind of messy.

To make your narrative essay consistent, I can standardize tense and tone, explain each change line by line, and suggest structural and formatting improvements.\\n\\nBefore I proceed, two quick questions to tailor the edit:\\n- Tense preference: Would you like the whole piece in simple past (because the event happened “yesterday”) or in vivid present (present-tense storytelling)? I can do either, but simple past is most typical for this kind of narrative.\\n- Tone preference: Would you like a neutral, semi-formal tone or a more casual, conversational tone? Given your audience (“general readers”), semi-formal/neutral is often best.\\n\\nOverview of editorial guidance:\\n- Choose a single dominant tense (recommendation: simple past) and make all verbs align.\\n- Unify tone by removing slang and using clear, neutral wording.\\n- Smooth out sentence structure (replace the semicolon with a period, clarify pronouns like “it,” and maintain parallel verb forms).\\n- Keep evaluation of your writing (comments about structure/style) in the same tense for consistency, unless you want a deliberate contrast.\\n\\nLine-by-line edits with reasons:\\n1) Original: “Yesterday I walk to the beach and I am watching the waves; later I will wrote about it.”\\n   Edit: “Yesterday, I walked to the beach and watched the waves. Later, I planned to write about the experience.”\\n   Why:\\n   - “walk” → “walked” and “am watching” → “watched” to align with simple past (“Yesterday” sets the timeline).\\n   - Replace the semicolon with a period for clarity and flow.\\n   - “will wrote” is ungrammatical; “planned to write” matches past time and reads smoothly.\\n   - “it” is vague; “the experience” is clearer for readers.\\n\\n2) Original: “I'm gonna add more details because it felt awesome, but the structure is all over the place and I start with the ending.”\\n   Edit: “I intended to add more details because it felt wonderful, but the structure was all over the place, and I started with the ending.”\\n   Why:\\n   - “I’m gonna” → “I intended to” to standardize tone (semi-formal) and tense (past).\\n   - “awesome” → “wonderful” for a neutral tone suitable for general readers.\\n   - “is” → “was” and “start” → “started” to maintain past tense.\\n   - Add a comma before “and” to separate independent clauses and improve readability.\\n\\n3) Original: “The style switches between casual and formal.”\\n   Edit: “The style shifted between casual and formal.”\\n   Why:\\n   - “switches” → “shifted” to keep past tense consistent.\\n   - Keeps your point while aligning tone and tense with the rest.\\n\\nCategorized feedback:\\n\\nOverall Feedback:\\n- The main issue is inconsistent tense (present, future, and past mixed) and shifting tone (slang vs. formal). Choosing simple past and a neutral, semi-formal voice will make the narrative clear and cohesive for general readers.\\n- Clarify vague references (like “it”) and avoid unnecessary punctuation complexity for short, straightforward sentences.\\n\\nSpelling Edits:\\n- “gonna” → “going to” (or, better here, “intended to”) because “gonna” is colloquial and not ideal for a general-audience essay.\\n- No other spelling errors found.\\n\\nGrammar Edits:\\n- Tense standardization: change “walk,” “am watching,” “will wrote,” “is,” “start,” “switches” to past forms (“walked,” “watched,” “planned to write,” “was,” “started,” “shifted”).\\n- Verb form correction: “will wrote” is incorrect. Use “planned to write” or “would write” (future-in-the-past).\\n- Punctuation: Replace the semicolon with a period for clarity; add a comma before “and” when joining independent clauses.\\n\\nStructural Suggestions:\\n- If your essay “starts with the ending,” decide if that’s intentional (a hook) or accidental. If intentional, signal it clearly: for example, begin with a brief reflection and then transition to the chronological story.\\n- Otherwise, consider chronological order: open with arriving at the beach, describe sensory details (sight, sound, feeling), then conclude with your plan to write about it and what you learned.\\n- Clarify “the experience” rather than “it,” and add one or two concrete sensory images to anchor the narrative.\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement:\\n- Add specific details to elevate style: mention the color/texture of the waves, the wind, the scent of salt, or how the water’s rhythm affected your mood.\\n- Replace general adjectives (“wonderful”) with precise ones that match your experience (“calming,” “invigorating,” “overwhelming”).\\n- Consider a brief reflective sentence at the end tying the experience to why you wanted to write about it.\\n\\nFormatting Guidance:\\n- Use short, clear paragraphs. For a brief narrative: 1) arrival and first impressions; 2) watching the waves; 3) reflection and writing intention.\\n- Avoid excessive semicolons in simple narrative prose. Use periods and commas to keep rhythm steady.\\n- Keep consistent voice throughout; if you include meta-remarks about your structure, keep them in the same tense as the narrative or set them off as a separate paragraph.\\n\\nWould you like me to apply these changes and generate a clean, edited version in:\\n- Simple past, semi-formal tone; or\\n- Present tense (for vivid immediacy), semi-formal tone?\\n\\nIf you prefer, I can provide both versions so you can choose.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"ruleid\": \"9\",\n    \"testid\": \"1\",\n    \"expectedoutput\": \"The 'Structural Suggestions' section provides concrete recommendations to reorder, combine, expand, or trim parts, each explaining improvements to coherence, flow, or argument.\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"None; input complies; multi-paragraph summary invites specific structural reordering and trimming suggestions.\",\n    \"user_input\": \"goal: improve organization type: research summary audience: instructor feedback: structural suggestions text: paragraph1: The results section lists three key findings, then I introduce my research question. paragraph2: Background information appears after the conclusion, and some duplicated points appear in both sections. paragraph3: Methods are briefly mentioned at the end, although they should be earlier.\",\n    \"testinput\": \"goal: improve organization type: research summary audience: instructor feedback: structural suggestions text: paragraph1: The results section lists three key findings, then I introduce my research question. paragraph2: Background information appears after the conclusion, and some duplicated points appear in both sections. paragraph3: Methods are briefly mentioned at the end, although they should be earlier.\",\n    \"scenario\": \"\",\n    \"generation\": 0,\n    \"baseline\": false,\n    \"inverse\": false,\n    \"testuid\": \"test-10155443\",\n    \"groundtruthScore\": 95,\n    \"groundtruthModel\": \"gpt-5-2025-08-07\",\n    \"groundtruth\": \"Quick questions so I tailor the edit:\\n- Do you have a required word count or section headings for this research summary?\\n- Are you using a specific citation style (APA, MLA, Chicago)?\\n- Does your instructor require particular sections (e.g., Research Question, Background, Methods, Results, Conclusion), or is the structure flexible?\\n\\nOverview of my approach:\\n- Because this is a research summary for an instructor, I’ll prioritize clarity, logical flow, and standard academic ordering: Research Question → Background → Methods → Results → Discussion/Conclusion.\\n- I’ll give line-by-line edits to the three sentences you shared and explain the reasoning.\\n- I’ll provide structural suggestions to eliminate duplication, fix section order, and improve transitions.\\n- I’ll finish with formatting guidance typical for a short research summary and offer to rewrite the piece.\\n\\nOverall Feedback:\\n- Main issue is section order: the research question should come before results, background should not follow the conclusion, and methods should precede results.\\n- Remove duplication between background and conclusion; each section should have a distinct purpose (context vs. synthesis/implications).\\n- Use consistent tense: past tense for methods and results, present tense for the research question and general claims.\\n- Prefer clear signposting (topic sentences and headings) and avoid informal sequencing phrases like “then.”\\n\\nSpelling Edits:\\n- No spelling errors in the three sentences.

For persuasion, turn this into a firm thesis and propose concrete solutions.\\n- Avoid uncertainty (“I don’t know how”); instead, present actionable recommendations.\\n- Strengthen tone by using precise, academic vocabulary (e.g., “unappetizing,” “revise the policy,” “increase participation,” “reduce waste”).\\n\\nSpelling edits:\\n- No spelling errors present.\\n- Style note: “taste bad” is acceptable because “taste” is a linking verb and takes an adjective (“bad”). If you want a more formal tone, consider “taste poor” or “are unappetizing.”\\n\\nGrammar edits:\\n- Subject–verb agreement: “School lunches is” → “School lunches are.”\\n- Subject–verb agreement: “students is complaining” → “students are complaining.”\\n- Comma usage: Add a comma before “but” and before “though” to correctly join independent clauses.\\n- Precision: Add modifiers like “often” or “many” to avoid absolute generalizations.\\n\\nStructural suggestions:\\n- Use a clear five-part structure:\\n  1) Introduction: Hook (e.g., a short observation about students throwing away food), context (health goals), and thesis (policy should balance nutrition and taste).\\n  2) Body paragraph 1: Why taste matters (participation rates, reduced waste, better energy and focus).\\n  3) Body paragraph 2: Proposed solutions (student taste-tests, seasoning stations, more fresh options, culturally diverse menus, feedback surveys).\\n  4) Body paragraph 3 (counterargument): Address constraints (USDA guidelines, budget) and show feasible ways to comply (work with a nutritionist, pilot recipes within guidelines, negotiate vendor pricing).\\n  5) Conclusion: Call to action (ask the school board to run a pilot, create a student advisory committee, timeline).\\n- Use topic sentences and transitions (“Furthermore,” “However,” “As a result,” “To address these concerns…”).\\n\\nOpportunities for improvement:\\n- Add evidence: brief data (e.g., “In a recent student survey, 62% reported throwing away parts of their lunch”), observations, or quotes from peers.\\n- Define success metrics: participation rates, food waste reduction, student satisfaction surveys.\\n- Make recommendations concrete: “Introduce monthly taste-tests,” “Offer a seasoning bar (herbs, lemon, low-sodium options),” “Pilot three new recipes per quarter.”\\n\\nFormatting guidance:\\n- If this is a standard high-school persuasive essay:\\n  - Include a clear title (e.g., “Balancing Nutrition and Taste in School Lunches”).\\n  - Use an introduction with a thesis at the end of the first paragraph.\\n  - Double-space, 12-point Times New Roman, 1-inch margins.\\n  - If citing sources or data, follow your class’s required style (MLA/APA) with in-text citations and a Works Cited/References page.\\n- If it’s a letter to the school board, use a proper salutation, concise paragraphs, and a polite call to action.\\n\\nWould you like me to:\\n- Expand this into a full persuasive paragraph or a 5-paragraph essay using the stronger thesis?\\n- Incorporate specific evidence if you have any survey results or observations?\\n\\nIf helpful, here’s a concise revised version of your two sentences with a stronger persuasive tone:\\n“School lunches are intended to be healthy, but they often taste unappetizing, and many students are complaining.

Replace “complaining” with “expressing concerns” or “reporting challenges.”\\n- Clarity and purpose: State your thesis succinctly: homework supports learning, but it should be balanced and purposeful. Then quickly define what “balance” means (e.g., reasonable limits, coordination, quality over quantity).\\n- Solution-focused approach: Move beyond the problem to propose practical, actionable steps the committee can adopt. Emphasize benefits for teachers (better completion quality, fewer burnout-related issues, more meaningful class time).\\n- Structure: Use a clear speech flow—acknowledge concerns, present evidence or observations, propose solutions, invite collaboration, and end with a respectful call to action.\\n\\nSpelling Edits\\n- “we needs” → “we need”\\n  - Explanation: Subject–verb agreement; “we” takes the base form “need.”\\n\\nGrammar Edits\\n- Comma splice: “Students are complaining about too much homework, I argue…” joins two independent clauses with a comma.\\n  - Fix with a conjunction or punctuation:\\n    - “…too much homework, and I argue…”\\n    - “…too much homework; I argue…”\\n    - Or split into two sentences.\\n- Word order and parallelism: “but also we needs balance” is awkward and ungrammatical.\\n  - Smoother: “but we also need balance.”\\n- Tone refinement (not grammar but important for audience): “complaining” can sound dismissive. Prefer “expressing concerns” or “reporting that the workload feels heavy.”\\n\\nStructural Suggestions\\n- Suggested outline for a short persuasive speech:\\n  1. Opening: Acknowledge shared goals (student learning, skill-building) and the role of homework.\\n  2. Problem statement: Students are reporting that the volume/timing of homework can feel overwhelming, which impacts well-being and quality of learning.\\n  3. Evidence/observations: Briefly reference observations, survey data, or examples (e.g., overlapping due dates across departments).\\n  4. Proposal: Define “balance” and offer concrete steps (reasonable time estimates, coordination, purposeful assignments).\\n  5. Benefits: Explain how these steps improve outcomes for students and teachers (better engagement, higher-quality work).\\n  6. Call to action: Invite the committee to pilot guidelines or form a working group.\\n- Keep paragraphs short and use transitions (“First,” “In addition,” “Therefore”) to guide listeners.\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement\\n- Define “necessary”: Specify why homework matters (practice, reinforcement, self-management).\\n- Define “balance”: Offer specifics (e.g., weekly time caps by grade level, no-homework nights before major tests, coordination across departments to avoid stacking, focus on quality over quantity).\\n- Include one brief anecdote or data point to humanize the issue.\\n- Anticipate objections: Acknowledge that some practice is essential and propose flexible approaches (e.g., optional challenge problems, choice in assignments).\\n- Use rhetorical strategies: Parallel structure (“Purposeful, proportional, and predictable”), a concise triad, and a clear call to action.\\n\\nFormatting Guidance\\n- For a spoken draft:\\n  - Use short sentences and line breaks where you want pauses.\\n  - Add transitions to signpost your points.\\n  - Emphasize key phrases by placing them at the end of sentences for impact.\\n  - Aim for 1–3 minutes depending on meeting constraints; practice out loud to adjust pacing.\\n\\nLine-by-line edits of your sentence\\n- Original: “Students are complaining about too much homework, I argue that homework is necessary but also we needs balance.”\\n- Edited (basic fix, formal tone):\\n  - “Many students are expressing concerns about the amount of homework, and I argue that homework is necessary, but we also need balance.”\\n  - Reasoning: Replaces “complaining” with “expressing concerns” (respectful); fixes comma splice with “and”; adds a comma before “but” for readability; corrects “we needs” to “we need.”\\n- Edited (more persuasive and audience-aware):\\n  - “Many students have reported that the volume of homework can feel overwhelming. Homework is essential for learning, and we can strengthen its impact by ensuring a better balance.”\\n  - Reasoning: Splits into two sentences to improve clarity; adds purpose (“essential for learning”); reframes “balance” as improving impact, which aligns with educator goals.\\n- Edited (concise thesis statement):\\n  - “Homework is essential, but it works best when it is purposeful, proportional, and coordinated.”\\n  - Reasoning: Tight triad provides a clear, memorable standard.\\n\\nWould you like me to generate the edited speech?\\n- I can expand this into a 1–2 minute speech tailored to your audience with specific proposals and a respectful call to action.

If you paste the full draft, I can give line-by-line edits across the whole piece.\\n\\nOverall Feedback\\n- Your core claim (“climate change is real”) needs support from credible sources and specific data to be persuasive. Readers expect evidence, definitions, and clear reasoning.\\n- Paragraphs should each focus on a single idea with a topic sentence, evidence, and analysis. Choppiness often comes from abrupt transitions, mixed ideas in one paragraph, or insufficient explanation between claims.\\n- Maintain a clear, neutral, and evidence-driven tone. Avoid overly emotional language; prioritize accuracy, citations, and logic.\\n\\nSpelling Edits\\n- “The argument say” should be “The argument says.” Reason: subject-verb agreement; “argument” (singular) takes “says.”\\n- No spelling errors in the provided sentence, but watch for common climate-related terms:\\n  - “greenhouse gases” (two words)\\n  - “carbon dioxide” (not “carbon di-oxide”)\\n  - “Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)” capitalization and acronym\\n  - “peer-reviewed” hyphenation\\n\\nGrammar Edits\\n- Original: “The argument say climate change is real but I don’t provide any data and the paragraphs is choppy.”\\n  - Edit: “The argument says climate change is real, but I don’t provide any data, and the paragraphs are choppy.”\\n  - Reasons:\\n    - Subject-verb agreement: “argument says”\\n    - Commas for compound sentence and clarity before “but” and to separate clauses\\n    - Plural verb for “paragraphs are”\\n    - Parallel structure: align verb forms (“is real,” “don’t provide,” “are choppy”)\\n- Use consistent tense. In analytical essays, present tense is common (“Research shows…,” “This evidence indicates…”).\\n- Prefer active voice for clarity: “The data show…” instead of “It is shown by data…”\\n\\nStructural Suggestions\\n- Use a clear structure:\\n  - Introduction: define climate change briefly, present your thesis (“Climate change is real because X, Y, and Z”), and preview main points.\\n  - Body paragraph 1: Physical evidence (global temperature rise, ice melt). Include one or two specific data points.\\n  - Body paragraph 2: Mechanism (greenhouse effect, CO2 trends). Explain cause-and-effect with sources.\\n  - Body paragraph 3: Impacts (sea-level rise, extreme weather). Use recent examples and studies.\\n  - Body paragraph 4 (optional): Address a counterargument (e.g., natural variability) and refute with evidence.\\n  - Conclusion: restate thesis, synthesize insights, and end with implications or a call to informed understanding.\\n- Within each paragraph:\\n  - Topic sentence stating the claim.\\n  - Evidence (data, studies) with citation.\\n  - Analysis linking evidence to your claim (“This matters because…”).\\n  - Concluding sentence that transitions to the next paragraph.\\n- Add signpost transitions:\\n  - Between paragraphs: “First,” “Additionally,” “In contrast,” “Moreover,” “Consequently.”\\n  - Within paragraphs: “For example,” “Specifically,” “This suggests,” “As a result.”\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement\\n- Clarity: Define key terms (e.g., “climate change,” “greenhouse gases,” “anomaly”) the first time you use them. Avoid vague phrases like “scientists say” and specify sources.\\n- Evidence: Incorporate reputable data (e.g., IPCC Assessment Reports, NASA GISS temperature records, NOAA sea-level trends, peer-reviewed studies). Include numbers with dates and units. Example: “Global mean surface temperature has increased by approximately 1.1°C since the late 19th century (IPCC, 2023).”\\n- Examples: Use concrete, recent case studies to illustrate trends (e.g., “The 2023 Canadian wildfires released X megatonnes of CO2,” or “Arctic sea ice extent has declined by ~13% per decade since 1979.”).\\n- Transitions: Bridge your ideas with signposting and summary sentences to avoid choppiness. End each paragraph by linking back to the thesis and foreshadowing the next point.\\n- Tone: Aim for measured, objective language. Replace emotionally charged wording with precise, sourced statements. Acknowledge uncertainties where appropriate, and include a brief counterargument section to increase credibility.\\n- Beyond error correction: Consider adding visual aids (if permitted), such as a graph of CO2 concentrations over time or a table of temperature anomalies, and discuss what they show. Integrate a brief methodology note (“This dataset is derived from…”). Strengthen synthesis by showing how multiple lines of evidence converge.\\n\\nFormatting Guidance\\n- If this is a school essay:\\n  - Use standard formatting (12 pt Times New Roman, double-spaced, 1-inch margins).\\n  - Include a clear title and your name/date/class if required.\\n  - Follow MLA or APA for in-text citations and a Works Cited/References page.\\n  - Paragraph length: aim for 6–10 well-developed sentences per paragraph.\\n- Citation examples:\\n  - MLA: (IPCC 23)\\n  - APA: (IPCC, 2023)\\n- If images/charts are allowed, label them, cite sources, and reference them in the text (“As shown in Figure 1…”).\\n\\nSample line-by-line edit of your provided sentence\\n- Original: The argument say climate change is real but I don’t provide any data and the paragraphs is choppy.\\n- Edited: The argument says climate change is real, but I don’t provide any data, and the paragraphs are choppy.\\n  - Reasoning:\\n    - “say” → “says” for subject-verb agreement.\\n    - Commas improve readability in a compound sentence.\\n    - “paragraphs is” → “paragraphs are” for plural subject agreement.\\n    - Balanced parallel structure across clauses.\\n\\nWould you like me to:\\n- Review your full draft with line-by-line edits?\\n- Create an outline and a thesis statement tailored to your assignment?\\n- Rewrite your essay to incorporate evidence, examples, transitions, and a professional tone?\\n\\nIf you paste the text or share the document, I’ll provide detailed, itemized edits and a polished version.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"testinput\": \"goals: I'm just getting started—what can you do for my writing, and how do your edits work?\\ntype_of_writing: general inquiry\\ntarget_audience: me\\nfeedback_focus: Please briefly explain your purpose and give short examples for how you'd help with an essay and an email.\\ntone_preferences: concise, friendly\\nconstraints: keep it brief; I don't have a draft yet\\nadditional_notes: I will paste text later\",\n    \"scenario\": \"\",\n    \"generation\": 0,\n    \"testuid\": \"baseline-test-hlyqdp9hk\",\n    \"baseline\": true,\n    \"inverse\": false,\n    \"groundtruthScore\": 70,\n    \"groundtruthModel\": \"gpt-5-2025-08-07\",\n    \"groundtruth\": \"Here’s how I can help, briefly:\\n\\nPurpose\\n- I edit and improve your writing with line-by-line suggestions on clarity, grammar, style, structure, and formatting—always with short explanations for each change.\\n\\nHow my edits work\\n- You share your draft (paste text or upload).

Tightening the thesis and removing hedging (“I think”) will make your argument more persuasive.\\n- The flow improves when you use consistent present tense, avoid second-person “you,” and connect examples directly to your claim.\\n- Word choice like “isolated,” “performance,” and “addictive design” strengthens academic tone without losing your voice.\\n\\nSpelling Edits:\\n- “todays” → “today’s” (apostrophe shows possession).\\n- “dont” → “do not” (or “don’t” if you prefer; “do not” is more formal).\\n\\nGrammar Edits:\\n- Treat “social media” as singular: “social media is,” not “are.”\\n- Subject-verb agreement: “makes,” not “make.”\\n- Pluralize general habits: “on weekends,” not “on weekend.”\\n- Comma usage: Add comma before “but” when joining independent clauses; remove comma before “because” unless needed for clarity.\\n- Pronoun consistency: Avoid second-person “you” in academic writing; use “people” or “we.”\\n- Place MLA citation before the period: “…addictive (Turkle 45).”\\n\\nStructural Suggestions:\\n- Put a clear thesis early, ideally as the first or second sentence. For example: “Although social media helps us communicate, its addictive design makes us lonelier and weakens our attention, which harms our real-world relationships and school performance.”\\n- Keep one example per paragraph and tie it back to the thesis explicitly (e.g., explain how weekend habits reflect isolation and attention issues).\\n- Consider ending the paragraph with a sentence that previews the next point or reinforces your claim (a mini-conclusion).\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement:\\n- Add a brief transition from your example back to the broader impact (e.g., “This pattern shows how digital connection can replace in-person time.”).\\n- If you’ll include more evidence later, think about varying examples (school focus, relationships, mental health) while staying within your assignment’s scope.\\n- Consider a signal phrase for the source: “As Turkle argues, social media’s design encourages addictive behavior (45).” This integrates the citation smoothly.\\n\\nFormatting Guidance (MLA):\\n- In-text citations: Place the parenthetical citation before the period: “…addictive (Turkle 45).”\\n- Maintain double-spacing, 1-inch margins, Times New Roman 12 pt, and a running header with your last name and page number.\\n- First page header: Your Name, Teacher’s Name, Course, Date (Day Month Year), then centered essay title, then your text.\\n- Works Cited: Include a placeholder entry for Turkle.

I’ll keep your reflective, slightly whimsical voice and first-person perspective intact while focusing on tense consistency, clarity, dialogue punctuation, pacing, and show-vs.-tell. Before I dive in, two quick questions so I can tailor the edits:\\n- Do you want the piece to read in past tense or present tense? Because you mention “last night,” past tense is the most consistent choice; I can also adjust the time marker if you prefer present tense immediacy.\\n- Any word count or submission requirements from the magazine (font, margins, etc.), beyond standard manuscript format?\\n\\nOverview of what I’ll do:\\n- Make all verbs consistent in one tense (recommend past tense to match “last night”).\\n- Tighten descriptions for clarity while preserving your imagery and tone.\\n- Correct dialogue punctuation and adjust sentence boundaries for rhythm and pacing.\\n- Offer show-vs.-tell upgrades through small sensory details and interior beats.\\n- Provide structural and formatting guidance for a clean submission.\\n\\nOverall Feedback\\n- Your opening immediately establishes mood with “buzzing like a hive” and the quirky, secret-knowing whale—great voice. The main issues are tense shifts (present to past and back), a few unclear or repetitive verbs, and one long sentence that would land better if split. With consistent tense and a few rhythm tweaks, the scene will feel polished and vivid.\\n\\nSpelling Edits\\n- No spelling errors detected.\\n- Small word choice polish recommended:\\n  - “empty place” → “empty arcade” for specificity and clarity.\\n\\nGrammar Edits (line-by-line with proposed revisions and reasoning)\\n- Original: “I walk into the old arcade last night and the lights were buzzing like a hive.”\\n  - Proposed: “I walked into the old arcade last night, and the lights buzzed like a hive.”\\n  - Why: Aligns tense with “last night” (walk → walked; were buzzing → buzzed), improves flow with a comma to join independent clauses, and pares “were buzzing” to “buzzed” for tighter prose.\\n\\n- Original: “The air smells of dust and coins.”\\n  - Proposed: “The air smelled of dust and coins.”\\n  - Why: Past tense consistency (smells → smelled). “Of” is fine; the phrase is concise and evocative.\\n\\n- Original: “You coming?” Jay says, but I was already at the claw machine, staring at a plush whale that looks at me like it knows a secret.\\n  - Proposed Option A (clean and concise): “You coming?” Jay said, but I was already at the claw machine, staring at a plush whale that looked at me like it knew a secret.\\n  - Proposed Option B (stronger pacing): “You coming?” Jay said. I was already at the claw machine, staring at a plush whale that looked at me like it knew a secret.\\n  - Why: Past tense consistency (says → said; looks → looked; knows → knew). Option B splits the long sentence, creating a clearer beat that shows your focus shifting from Jay to the whale.\\n\\n- Original: “I drop the token. It clatters.”\\n  - Proposed: “I dropped the token. It clattered.”\\n  - Why: Past tense consistency (drop → dropped; clatters → clattered). The short, paired sentences keep a nice staccato rhythm.\\n\\n- Original: “I am thinking this is silly and then the claw was moving and my heart thumped.”\\n  - Proposed Option A: “I thought it was silly, and then the claw moved and my heart thumped.”\\n  - Proposed Option B (smoother cause-effect): “I thought it was silly until the claw moved and my heart thumped.”\\n  - Why: Past tense consistency (am thinking → thought; was moving → moved). Option B tightens the causal turn—your feeling changes when the claw moves.\\n\\n- Original: “The whale slips, then it slip again and I laugh, but it sounded too loud in the empty place.”\\n  - Proposed Option A: “The whale slipped, then slipped again, and I laughed, but the sound was too loud in the empty arcade.”\\n  - Proposed Option B (pacing with emphasis): “The whale slipped—then slipped again—and I laughed, but the sound was too loud in the empty arcade.”\\n  - Why: Past tense consistency (slips/slip → slipped), parallel structure for “slipped,” and clarity (“empty place” → “empty arcade”). Option B uses em dashes to mimic the stuttering motion of the claw for vivid pacing.\\n\\nStructural Suggestions\\n- Consider splitting the sentence with Jay’s dialogue from your action (Option B above) to emphasize your pull toward the whale and create a cleaner transition.\\n- Use a brief interior beat after “It clattered” to show your anticipation or self-consciousness (e.g., “I pretended not to care, but my fingers hovered near the joystick”). This adds texture without changing plot beats.\\n- The final sentence is carrying several actions; using em dashes or a period can distribute emphasis and make the scene feel more dynamic.\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement (show vs. tell and pacing)\\n- Show the arcade’s emptiness with a sensory detail: the soundtrack loop barely audible, a sticky spot under your shoe, or the flicker of a half-dead neon letter. This replaces “empty place” with concrete atmosphere.\\n- Give us a reflective beat that matches the whimsical tone when you see the whale: one line of internal narration connects your fascination to why it “knows a secret,” e.g., “It had the sleepy smile of someone who’s already won.”\\n- Vary sentence lengths: keep your short, punchy lines (“It clattered.”), but let one or two longer sentences carry mood. You already do this—just tighten the long ones to avoid run-ons.\\n\\nFormatting Guidance (standard manuscript)\\n- Use 12-point Times New Roman, double-spaced, 1-inch margins, left-aligned, and indent the first line of each paragraph by 0.5 inches.\\n- Include a header with your last name, story title (shortened if needed), and page number on each page (top right).\\n- Dialogue punctuation:\\n  - Keep punctuation inside the quotation marks: “You coming?”\\n  - Use a lower-case dialogue tag if it continues the sentence: “You coming?” Jay said.\\n  - Consider a period and new sentence when shifting focus: “You coming?” Jay said. I was already…\\n\\nWould you like me to generate a fully revised version in past tense (or present, if you prefer), incorporating all the suggested changes and pacing tweaks? I can also add one or two subtle sensory details to deepen the mood while preserving your voice.\\n\\nAnything else you want me to prioritize—word count, submission guidelines, or specific magazine preferences?\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"testinput\": \"goals: Make the tone professional, fix grammar and concision, and improve structure\\ntype_of_writing: complaint email to customer support\\ntarget_audience: electronics retailer customer service\\nfeedback_focus: line-by-line grammar/spelling edits with reasoning; structural suggestions; formatting for a clear, polite email\\nformatting: email format (subject line, greeting, body, call to action, signature)\\ntone_preferences: polite but firm\\nconstraints: keep order number and dates; no exaggerations; keep under 250 words\\ntext: Subject: Issue with damaged monitor order\\nTo whom it may concern,\\nI am writing about my order #A11359 placed on Aug 29.

We kept going.”\\n- Reason: Splitting the sentence improves rhythm and avoids a pile-up of commas; the short second sentence adds emphasis.\\n\\n6) “This taught me how community isn’t a slogan; it’s people showing up for each other.”\\n- Suggested edit: “This taught me that community isn’t a slogan; it’s people showing up for each other.”\\n- Reason: “that” is the correct conjunction for a statement of realization.\\n\\n7) “I still worry about sounding ‘right,’ but I’ve learned to ask questions and keep trying even when I’m unsure.”\\n- Optional tweak: “I still worry about sounding ‘right,’ but I’ve learned to ask questions and keep trying, even when I’m unsure.”\\n- Reason: A comma before the final clause smooths pacing; keeping the quotes preserves your voice.\\n\\n8) “College, to me, is a place to grow that force of trying into something that can help others, especially families navigating systems that pretend to be simple.”\\n- Suggested edit: “To me, college is a place to turn that persistence into work that helps others—especially families navigating systems that seem simple on the surface.”\\n- Reason: “turn that persistence into work” tightens the abstract phrase; “seem simple on the surface” softens the tone slightly while preserving your point.\\n\\nSpelling Edits:\\n- “first-generation” is correctly hyphenated.\\n- “Mexican American” is correct; no hyphen needed in this usage.\\n- “flyers” is fine (U.S. usage). “fliers” is also acceptable; choose one and use it consistently.\\n\\nGrammar Edits:\\n- Prefer “as if I were” to “like I was” for formal tone.\\n- Use “that” after “taught me” for correct syntax.\\n- Consider splitting longer compound sentences (as in “It wasn’t perfect, but it worked. We kept going.”).\\n- Replace “on my cracked phone” with “using my cracked phone” for idiomatic clarity.\\n\\nStructural Suggestions (to reach ~600–650 words):\\n- Paragraph 1 (hook + context): Keep your opening but add a micro-scene (e.g., a moment in the bank office with a specific phrase you translated and how it made you feel). 120–150 words.\\n- Paragraph 2 (challenge + actions): Expand the pandemic period. Describe your strategy briefly (creating flyers, writing emails, what you put on the website), and include one concrete outcome (e.g., number of new orders, partnerships, a thank-you message). 200–250 words.\\n- Paragraph 3 (reflection): Tie your actions to a broader lesson—learning to ask questions, demystifying systems, building trust. 120–150 words.\\n- Paragraph 4 (forward-looking close): Connect the skills and mindset to what you hope to develop in college (e.g., tools for small businesses or families, communication, data, policy, tech). End with a concise return to your opening metaphor (“the language of responsibility” and community). 120–150 words.\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement:\\n- Add one brief, concrete detail about the website (e.g., menu photos, order form, testimonials) and how you spread the word (texts, local Facebook groups, church bulletin).\\n- Include a measurable or observable result to show impact.\\n- Show a moment of uncertainty and how you resolved it (e.g., teaching yourself a website builder, asking a librarian for help).\\n- Name transferable skills: translating complex information, perseverance, community-building, communication.\\n- Clarify your future direction (fields or skills you want to build) without locking into a major: this helps admissions readers see growth potential.\\n\\nFormatting Guidance (650-word limit, admissions conventions):\\n- Aim for 3–5 short paragraphs with clear transitions.\\n- Vary sentence lengths; avoid long strings of clauses.\\n- Standard punctuation is best; an em dash or semicolon is fine sparingly.\\n- Keep language clean and direct; avoid jargon.\\n- Stay under 650 words; 600–640 reads well and leaves room for final polishing.\\n\\nWould you like me to:\\n- Edit the full ~590-word draft line by line?\\n- Or expand this excerpt into a polished 600–650-word essay that incorporates these suggestions while keeping your voice?\\n\\nIf you want, I can also generate a revised version of this paragraph now, incorporating the specific edits above.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"testinput\": \"goals: Improve word choice, check capitalization and punctuation; preserve line breaks and imagery\\ntype_of_writing: poem (free verse)\\ntarget_audience: school literary journal\\nfeedback_focus: line-by-line edits with reasoning; subtle style suggestions; formatting guidance for line breaks/stanzas\\nformatting: poetry conventions (intentional capitalization choices, em-dashes)\\ntone_preferences: lyrical, contemplative\\nconstraints: maintain metaphors and core images; do not impose rhyme\\ntext: the sun dropps behind the hill—\\ni chase the day like a late bus,\\nshoes unlaced, the gravel keeps my secrets.\\nI call the trees my witnesses\\nand they don’t answer (they never did)\\nbut the leaves clap anyway, a small stadium.\\ntomorrow is a folded map in my pocket\\nthat I forgot to unfold.\",\n    \"scenario\": \"\",\n    \"generation\": 0,\n    \"testuid\": \"baseline-test-979705jj1\",\n    \"baseline\": true,\n    \"inverse\": false,\n    \"groundtruthScore\": 95,\n    \"groundtruthModel\": \"gpt-5-2025-08-07\",\n    \"groundtruth\": \"Thanks for sharing your poem. I’ll focus on improving word choice, capitalization, punctuation, and tense consistency while preserving your line breaks, imagery, and free-verse feel. Before I propose a final edited version, a couple of quick questions to make sure my edits match your intent:\\n- Do you want a consistent lowercase style (including “i”), or standard capitalization throughout? Your current poem mixes both.\\n- Are you open to small tense tweaks to keep the poem present-focused?\\n- Do you prefer parentheses for asides, or would you like to use em dashes for a more seamless, lyrical flow?\\n\\nOverview of the editorial approach\\n- Correct the single spelling error.\\n- Smooth tense consistency so the poem stays present-focused.\\n- Suggest a consistent capitalization approach (either all-lowercase for a lyrical, contemplative tone or standard capitalization for a more formal journal style).\\n- Offer subtle punctuation adjustments (em dashes vs commas/parentheses) to enhance cadence.\\n- Provide optional word-choice refinements that keep your metaphors intact.\\n- Offer an optional stanza break to heighten the emotional turn.\\n\\nLine-by-line edits with reasoning\\n- Line 1: “the sun dropps behind the hill—”\\n  - Change “dropps” to “drops” (spelling).\\n  - Keep the em dash; it works well as a lingering pause and sets the contemplative tone.\\n  - Capitalization choice: if you go all-lowercase, this line is already aligned.\\n\\n- Line 2: “i chase the day like a late bus,”\\n  - This line reads well. The simile is vivid and contemporary.\\n  - Capitalization choice: keep “i” lowercase if you choose the all-lowercase style; otherwise change to “I.”\\n\\n- Line 3: “shoes unlaced, the gravel keeps my secrets.”\\n  - The comma works, but consider an em dash for a more lyrical hinge: “shoes unlaced—the gravel keeps my secrets.”\\n  - Reason: the dash strengthens the connection and adds a musical pause. The phrase “keeps my secrets” is strong; if you want a tactile nuance, “holds” is an option, but “keeps” maintains the confidentiality image.\\n\\n- Line 4: “I call the trees my witnesses”\\n  - For capitalization consistency, use either “i” (if all-lowercase) or keep “I” and adjust earlier lines to standard case.\\n  - Optional word choice: “name the trees my witnesses” is slightly more formal/ceremonial; “call” is more conversational. Choose based on the tone you want.\\n\\n- Line 5: “and they don’t answer (they never did)”\\n  - Tense consistency: change “did” to “do” to keep the poem in the present: “and they don’t answer (they never do).”\\n  - If you prefer a seamless flow, consider an em dash instead of parentheses: “and they don’t answer— they never do.” Parentheses feel more self-aware; em dashes feel more embedded in the voice.\\n\\n- Line 6: “but the leaves clap anyway, a small stadium.”\\n  - Consider an em dash to clarify the apposition: “but the leaves clap anyway—a small stadium.”\\n  - Reason: the dash emphasizes “a small stadium” as a metaphorical rename rather than a loose addition. If you prefer a simile, “like a small stadium” is also clear, but the metaphor is stronger as-is.\\n\\n- Line 7: “tomorrow is a folded map in my pocket”\\n  - Strong image; reads clearly. No changes needed.\\n  - If you adopt standard capitalization, capitalize “Tomorrow.”\\n\\n- Line 8: “that I forgot to unfold.”\\n  - Tense consistency: shift to present perfect for cohesion with the rest of the poem: “that I haven’t yet unfolded.”\\n  - If you prefer a more direct phrasing, you can end the poem with an em dash for a quiet, suspended feeling:\\n    - “that I haven’t yet unfolded—”\\n    - Or add the pronoun for clarity: “that I haven’t yet unfolded it.” (This slightly reduces the elegance; the noun “map” already carries the action.)\\n\\nOverall Feedback\\n- Strengths: Your imagery is vivid and coherent—the late bus, witnesses of trees, stadium of leaves, and the folded map work together as a persuasive meditation on urgency and intention. Sound devices like “shoes,” “secrets,” and “stadium” give the poem soft consonance. The em dash in line 1 sets a reflective pace that suits the lyrical tone.\\n- Main improvements: Correct the spelling error, unify capitalization, and maintain present-tense consistency. A few punctuation adjustments can heighten the rhythm and clarity without changing your metaphors.\\n\\nSpelling Edits\\n- “dropps” → “drops”\\n  - Reason: Standard spelling.\\n\\nGrammar Edits\\n- Tense consistency:\\n  - “(they never did)” → “(they never do)” to keep present tense across the poem.\\n  - “that I forgot to unfold” → “that I haven’t yet unfolded” to align with present-focused narration.\\n- Capitalization consistency:\\n  - Choose one of the following:\\n    - All-lowercase style for a contemplative, modern feel: “i” throughout; keep line-initial words lowercase.\\n    - Standard capitalization for literary journal formality: Capitalize “The,” “I,” “Tomorrow,” and sentence beginnings.\\n\\nStructural Suggestions\\n- Consider a stanza break after line 6 to separate the external scene (chasing day, trees, leaves) from the inward turn (tomorrow as a map). For example:\\n  - Stanza 1: lines 1–6\\n  - Stanza 2: lines 7–8\\n  - Reason: It creates a clean pivot from witness/response to intention/future.\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement\\n- Punctuation cadence:\\n  - Line 3: Em dash instead of comma can strengthen the hinge between action and secrecy.\\n  - Line 6: Em dash before “a small stadium” clarifies apposition and heightens the image.\\n- Optional word-choice refinements (only if desired):\\n  - “call” → “name” for a ceremonial tone.\\n  - “keeps” → “holds” for tactile resonance. These are stylistic, not necessary.\\n\\nFormatting Guidance\\n- Em dashes: Use a true em dash (—) with no surrounding spaces for a clean, contemporary look, as you’ve done in line 1. If you add more dashes, keep that convention consistent.\\n- Parenthetical aside vs em dash: Parentheses create a thoughtful whisper; em dashes integrate the aside into the line’s flow. Either is acceptable—choose one style and apply it consistently.\\n- Capitalization:\\n  - All-lowercase is an accepted poetry convention and suits a contemplative tone; ensure “i” is consistently lowercase if you choose this.\\n  - If the journal favors standard capitalization, use sentence case for lines that form complete sentences.\\n- Line breaks: Your current breaks work well and should be preserved. If you add a stanza break after line 6, insert one blank line between stanzas.\\n\\nWould you like me to generate the edited poem? I can provide:\\n- Version A: all-lowercase with em dashes (contemplative style).\\n- Version B: standard capitalization with either em dashes or parentheses (more formal journal style).\\n\\nIf you have a preference on parentheses vs em dashes and capitalization style, tell me which you’d like, and I’ll produce the polished version accordingly.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"testinput\": \"goals: Clarify thesis and evaluation criteria; fix grammar and tone; suggest structure\\ntype_of_writing: book review\\ntarget_audience: classmates and teacher\\nfeedback_focus: line-by-line edits with reasoning; structural suggestions (intro-summary-analysis-conclusion); formatting guidance\\nformatting: MLA for book titles and quotes\\ntone_preferences: analytical yet accessible\\nconstraints: include at least one quote; avoid spoilers beyond mid-point\\ntext: In The Giver by Lois Lowry, the community seems perfect but actually its not.

Evaluating the book’s symbolism, pacing, and thematic depth, I argue that Lowry’s use of color powerfully represents freedom and choice, the mid-book pacing reduces urgency, and the ending—though ambiguous—invites thoughtful discussion.\\n\\nSummary (early plot only):\\nJonas lives in an orderly society designed to eliminate conflict and difference. Early in the novel, he notices an apple “change,” a moment that foreshadows his changing perception of the world and hints that not everything in his community is what it seems.\\n\\nAnalysis:\\nColor functions as a symbol of individuality and possibility, contrasting with the community’s uniform uniformity. As Jonas’s perceptions broaden, Lowry suggests that true choice requires the ability to perceive differences, linking the novel’s exploration of memory to moral responsibility. While the middle sections slow, the measured pacing mirrors the community’s controlled routine and emphasizes how difficult it is to disrupt a system built on predictability.\\n\\nConclusion:\\nAlthough the ending resists a tidy resolution, its openness is effective because it pushes readers to consider what safety costs and who pays that price. Overall, I recommend The Giver because it prompts reflection on choices, memory, and the price of safety.\\n\\nWould you like me to:\\n- Expand the analysis with one more early-text quote?\\n- Add MLA in-text citations with page numbers from your edition?\\n- Format a complete Works Cited section based on your edition details?\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"testinput\": \"goals: Improve clarity, consistency, and citation formatting; ensure a coherent argument\\ntype_of_writing: history research paper excerpt\\ntarget_audience: AP U.S. History teacher\\nfeedback_focus: line-by-line grammar and style edits with reasoning; structural suggestions; formatting and citation guidance\\nformatting: Chicago Notes-Bibliography (footnotes), page numbers, proper quotation format\\ntone_preferences: formal, objective\\nconstraints: keep footnote markers [1], [2] as placeholders; do not add sources\\ntext: The New Deal did not end the Great Depression; however, it redefined the relationship between citizens and the federal government.

I’ll focus on tightening structure, improving headings, fixing grammar, and making the post more scannable for web readers, while keeping your anecdotes and any links intact.\\n\\nQuick questions to tailor the edit:\\n- Do you want to keep it to two tips, or are you open to adding a brief “Try this” checklist under each tip?\\n- Preferred length: keep it short (under ~350 words) or expand slightly with examples?\\n- Any links you plan to add (e.g., Twitter, a Not-To-Do template) I should account for in formatting?\\n\\nOverview of the solution\\n- Line-by-line edits with reasoning to correct grammar, improve clarity, and standardize style.\\n- Structural suggestions for headings (H2/H3), bullets, and brief examples under each tip for scannability.\\n- Formatting guidance for web: short paragraphs, concise sentences, clear subheads, and bullet lists.\\n\\nLine-by-line edits (with reasoning)\\n- Title: “Title: How I Stopped Procrastinating By Doing Less”\\n  - Suggestion: Remove “Title:” and use Title Case: “How I Stopped Procrastinating by Doing Less”\\n  - Reason: Cleaner presentation; standard headline capitalization. Lowercase “by” is correct in title case.\\n\\n- Intro: “I used to think I need more apps to fix my procrastination. Turns out, I needed less—less options, less tabs, less guilt.”\\n  - Suggestion: “I used to think I needed more apps to fix my procrastination. Turns out, I needed less—fewer options, fewer tabs, and less guilt.”\\n  - Reason: Past tense consistency (“needed”), correct count vs. mass noun usage (“fewer” for countable items like options/tabs; “less” for mass nouns like guilt), add “and” for smoother cadence.\\n\\n- H2: “## Tip 1: Make a Not-To-Do List”\\n  - Suggestion: Keep as is, or standardize hyphenation/capitalization: “## Tip 1: Make a Not-To-Do List”\\n  - Reason: Consistent Title Case; “Not-To-Do List” is a widely recognized term.\\n\\n- Body: “This is not negative! It focuses your attention on what you should ignore.”\\n  - Suggestion: “This isn’t negative—it helps you focus on what to ignore.”\\n  - Reason: More natural phrasing, contraction fits friendly tone, em dash improves flow, trims repetition (“you should”).\\n\\n- Example: “For example, checking Twitter every 10 minutes is a bad loop I had.”\\n  - Suggestion: “For example, checking Twitter every 10 minutes was a habit I fell into.”\\n  - Reason: Past tense alignment (“was”), “habit” is clearer than “loop,” “fell into” is idiomatic and concise.\\n\\n- H2: “## Tip 2: Set \\\"good enough\\\" deadlines”\\n  - Suggestion: “## Tip 2: Set ‘Good-Enough’ Deadlines”\\n  - Reason: Title Case for headings, hyphenate “Good-Enough” when used as a compound adjective, use consistent quotation style (single quotes in headings are optional but keep consistent; alternatively remove quotes entirely for cleaner web style: “Set Good-Enough Deadlines”).\\n\\n- Body: “Perfectionism is a trap. If you schedule shorter blocks and accept B+ work at first, you will move faster.”\\n  - Suggestion: “Perfectionism is a trap. Schedule shorter time blocks and accept B+ work initially—you’ll move faster.”\\n  - Reason: Imperative form is more direct for web; “time blocks” adds clarity; “initially” is smoother; em dash creates a tight conclusion.\\n\\n- H2: “## Conclusion”\\n  - Suggestion: Keep as is.\\n\\n- Conclusion body: “Doing less is surprisingly brave. You will feel weird at first, but then free.”\\n  - Suggestion: “Doing less can be surprisingly brave. It may feel uncomfortable at first, but the payoff is freedom.”\\n  - Reason: “Can be” softens the claim, “uncomfortable” is clearer than “weird,” and “payoff is freedom” lands with a stronger, positive close.\\n\\nOverall Feedback\\n- Strong core idea and friendly tone. The simple, actionable tips fit a productivity audience.\\n- Key improvements: fix tense consistency, “less” vs. “fewer,” and make headings uniform and scannable. Add micro-examples or bullets under each tip for quick takeaways.\\n\\nSpelling Edits\\n- No outright spelling errors found.\\n- Consistency: “Twitter” is correctly capitalized. Consider consistent quotation style (single vs. double quotes). For web headings, you can drop quotes.\\n\\nGrammar Edits\\n- Past tense in the intro: “need” → “needed.”\\n- Count vs. mass nouns: “less options/tabs” → “fewer options/fewer tabs”; “less guilt” stays “less.”\\n- Idiomatic phrasing: “bad loop I had” → “habit I fell into.”\\n- Parallel structure and concision: remove “If” and use imperative in Tip 2 for a tighter message.\\n\\nStructural Suggestions\\n- Use H2 for each tip and H3 for brief examples or mini-checklists.\\n- Add scannable bullets under each tip:\\n  - Tip 1 bullets:\\n    - Try this: Write 3 things to ignore today (e.g., “Twitter refresh,” “email tabs after 7 p.m.,” “new app trials”).\\n    - Why it works: Reduces decision fatigue and removes low-value distractions.\\n  - Tip 2 bullets:\\n    - Try this: Set a 25–30 minute block; define “B+” criteria (clear, complete, not perfect).\\n    - Why it works: Time-boxing + “good-enough” standard speeds momentum.\\n- Consider a short one-line hook before the intro to grab attention (optional): “The fastest way I beat procrastination? I started doing less.”\\n- Keep paragraphs short (1–3 sentences) and avoid long clauses for readability.\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement\\n- Add one sentence to connect the two tips: “Both strategies eliminate decision friction so you can start faster.”\\n- Optional CTA: Invite readers to try one change today and share results (e.g., comment or share).\\n- If you plan to add links (e.g., to a Not-To-Do template or a time-boxing guide), place them at the end of each tip with descriptive anchor text.\\n\\nFormatting Guidance (web style: H2/H3, short paragraphs, bullets)\\n- Headings:\\n  - H2: Tip titles (Title Case, avoid quotes when possible).\\n  - H3: Example or “Try this” under each tip.\\n- Paragraphs: 1–3 sentences each; aim for ~15–20 words per sentence.\\n- Bullets: Use simple, parallel phrasing; start with verbs (“Write,” “Set,” “Define”).\\n- Links: Use descriptive anchors (“Not-To-Do template”), keep them intact, and place them after the relevant sentence or as a bullet.\\n- Punctuation: Use em dashes sparingly for emphasis; avoid exclamation points unless intentional for tone.\\n- Consistency: Use Title Case for headings; sentence case in body copy.\\n\\nWould you like me to generate a clean, edited version with H2/H3 headings, short paragraphs, and bullets, incorporating all these changes?

I can turn this into a coherent, motivational speech with smooth transitions, and provide line-by-line edits, structural suggestions, and speaking-note formatting. Before I finalize, two quick questions:\\n- Is a brief personal anecdote okay to include (you mention “I felt it last semester”)?\\n- Does your assignment require at least one cited statistic, or is a general reference to research acceptable?\\n\\nOverview of approach\\n- Tighten each line for grammar, clarity, and parallel structure.\\n- Add transitions that connect each section and build momentum.\\n- Expand the solution into clear, actionable steps that fit a 5–6 minute delivery.\\n- Format the speaking outline with cue words and timing estimates so it’s easy to deliver.\\n\\nOverall Feedback\\n- Strengths: Clear problem-solution frame, relatable hook, concise plan with three practical steps, strong close and call to action.\\n- Main improvements: Use subjunctive grammar in the hook, add a specific example in the evidence section, strengthen the counterargument, and smooth transitions between sections. Keep each step behaviorally specific so your audience can try it for 7 days.\\n\\nSpelling Edits (with reasoning)\\n- grayscale → correct as one word. Reason: Standard usage for display setting.\\n- no-phone mornings → keep hyphenated. Reason: Hyphen clarifies the compound adjective.\\n- check-ins → include hyphen. Reason: “Check-in” is hyphenated in noun form; plural is “check-ins.”\\n- “Screen time going up; attention going down.” → Keep “screen time” as two words; “attention” is correct.\\n\\nGrammar Edits (with reasoning)\\n- Hook: “Imagine if your phone is the boss of you.” → “Imagine if your phone were the boss of you.” Reason: Use the subjunctive “were” for a hypothetical.\\n- Evidence: “grades slipping, sleep shorter, I felt it last semester.” → “Grades slipped, my sleep got shorter, and I felt it last semester.” Reason: Parallel verb forms and add a conjunction to avoid a comma splice.\\n- Counter: “Phones are tools—yes, but tools shape us.” → “Phones are tools—yes. But tools also shape us.” Reason: Split into two sentences for emphasis; “also” signals concession with contrast.\\n- Solution: “3 steps: grayscale, no-phone mornings, buddy check-ins.” → “Three steps: turn on grayscale, try no-phone mornings, and set up buddy check-ins.” Reason: Spell out “three” in speech and use parallel imperative phrases.\\n- Close: “Ask audience to try it for 7 days.” → “Ask the audience to try it for seven days.” Reason: Spell out single-digit numbers in speech.\\n\\nStructural Suggestions (with reasoning)\\n- Order: Hook → Problem → Evidence (personal and one brief stat) → Counterargument → Solution (three steps) → Call to Action → Close. Reason: This sequence builds logic and motivation, keeping the audience engaged.\\n- Add transitions: Use “Here’s what that looks like,” “But there’s a catch,” and “So what can we do?” to guide listeners.\\n- Make each step concrete: Add “how,” “when,” and “why it helps” for each step to increase follow-through and fit the 7-day challenge.\\n- Time cues: Aim for roughly 30–45 seconds per early section, 2 minutes for the solution, and 1 minute for the call to action and close, totaling about 5–6 minutes.\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement\\n- Include one credible data point on attention, grades, or sleep (e.g., a brief stat from the CDC, APA, or a school survey). Keep it short: one sentence.\\n- Add a one-sentence personal anecdote to humanize the problem.\\n- Offer a simple way to measure progress (e.g., “Notice how many times you pick up your phone before lunch,” or “Track sleep for seven days”).\\n- Preempt objections: Acknowledge phones help us study and connect; you’re offering small guardrails, not a ban.\\n\\nFormatting Guidance for Speaking Notes\\n- Use clear section headers in ALL CAPS: HOOK, PROBLEM, EVIDENCE, COUNTER, SOLUTION, CALL TO ACTION, CLOSE.\\n- Keep one idea per line; aim for short phrases, not full paragraphs.\\n- Add cue words in brackets: [PAUSE], [LOOK UP], [SLOW DOWN], [SHOW OF HANDS].\\n- Put transitions on their own lines to help delivery.\\n- Include approximate time per section, so you hit 5–6 minutes.\\n- Bold is optional; if not available, use caps for emphasis; underline key phrases by writing them in caps (e.g., YOU DESERVE YOUR ATTENTION BACK).\\n\\nEdited Speaking Outline (5–6 minutes, with cue words)\\nHOOK (0:30)\\n- Imagine if your phone were the boss of you. [PAUSE] What would it tell you to do—now, now, now? [LOOK UP]\\n  Reason: Subjunctive “were” for hypothetical; short punchy questions create engagement.\\n\\nPROBLEM (0:45)\\n- Our screen time is going up; our attention is going down. [PAUSE]\\n- The cost? More distraction, less deep focus, and decisions that feel rushed.\\n  Reason: Parallel structure (“going up / going down”); names concrete consequences.\\n\\nEVIDENCE (1:00)\\n- Quick stat: Research links heavy screen use with shorter sleep and lower academic performance. [PAUSE]\\n- My example: Last semester, my grades slipped and my sleep got shorter because I kept scrolling past midnight. [SLOW DOWN]\\n  Reason: One concise research claim, plus a personal anecdote to ground the message.\\n\\nCOUNTERARGUMENT (0:45)\\n- Phones are tools—yes. But tools also shape us. [PAUSE]\\n- I’m not saying ditch your phone; I’m saying add small guardrails so the tool serves you. [LOOK UP]\\n  Reason: Acknowledge benefits; reframe as balance, not abstinence.\\n\\nTRANSITION (0:10)\\n- So what can we do—starting this week? [PAUSE]\\n  Reason: Signals the move to solutions and the 7-day challenge.\\n\\nSOLUTION: THREE STEPS (2:00)\\n- Step 1: Turn on grayscale. [PAUSE]\\n  - How: Switch your display to grayscale after 8 p.m. on weekdays. [PAUSE]\\n  - Why: Less color = fewer “click me” cues; it makes late-night scrolling less tempting.\\n  Reason: Imperative framing; time-bound instruction increases follow-through.\\n\\n- Step 2: No-phone mornings. [PAUSE]\\n  - How: For the first 30 minutes after you wake up, no social apps or texts. Start with water, stretch, and your first task. [LOOK UP]\\n  - Why: Protects your freshest attention; sets your focus before notifications set it for you.\\n  Reason: Concrete duration and replacement behaviors reduce friction.\\n\\n- Step 3: Buddy check-ins. [PAUSE]\\n  - How: Pair with a classmate today; send a one-line check-in each morning for seven days (“Grayscale on, 30-min no-phone done”). [SMILE]\\n  - Why: Accountability beats willpower. Share wins; reset if you slip.\\n  Reason: Simple script lowers barrier; normalizes imperfection.\\n\\nCALL TO ACTION (0:45)\\n- Try these three steps for seven days. Start tonight: grayscale at 8 p.m. [PAUSE]\\n- Tomorrow morning: 30 minutes no phone. [PAUSE]\\n- Before you leave class: pick a buddy. [SHOW OF HANDS] Who’s in?\\n  Reason: Break CTA into immediate, next, and today actions; invite participation.\\n\\nCLOSE (0:30)\\n- You deserve your attention back. [PAUSE] Give it seven days—and see what changes.\\n- If it helps, keep it. If not, adjust. But let your phone serve you, not boss you. [LOOK UP]\\n  Reason: Motivational yet grounded; emphasizes autonomy and experiment.\\n\\nLine-by-line Edits with Reasoning (comparing your original lines)\\n- Hook: “Imagine if your phone is the boss of you.” → “Imagine if your phone were the boss of you.”\\n  Reason: The subjunctive “were” fits hypothetical statements; it also sounds more polished in speech.\\n\\n- Problem: “Screen time going up; attention going down.” → “Our screen time is going up; our attention is going down.”\\n  Reason: Add “our” for audience inclusion; keep parallel structure for rhythm.\\n\\n- Evidence: “grades slipping, sleep shorter, I felt it last semester.” → “My grades slipped, my sleep got shorter, and I felt it last semester.”\\n  Reason: Use parallel past-tense verbs; add “my” for clarity and personal ownership; include “and” to avoid a comma splice.\\n\\n- Counter: “Phones are tools—yes, but tools shape us.” → “Phones are tools—yes. But tools also shape us.”\\n  Reason: Split for emphasis; “also” signals concession then contrast, improving flow.\\n\\n- Solution: “3 steps: grayscale, no-phone mornings, buddy check-ins.” → “Three steps: turn on grayscale, try no-phone mornings, and set up buddy check-ins.”\\n  Reason: Spell out numbers in speech; use parallel imperative phrases to make the plan actionable.\\n\\n- Close: “You deserve your attention back.” Ask audience to try it for 7 days. → “You deserve your attention back. Try it for seven days.”\\n  Reason: Keep the impactful sentence; make the call to action direct; spell out “seven.”\\n\\nWould you like me to generate a full speech script based on this outline (about 900–1,000 words for 5–6 minutes)?

If you were just moving cautiously, “walking carefully” may be more precise. I didn’t change it because it might be true to your experience.\\n\\n3) Original: “Later, in physical therapy, I learn patience I didn’t know I had.”\\n   Suggested edit: “Later, in physical therapy, I learned patience I didn’t know I had.”\\n   Reasoning:\\n   - “Learned” keeps the narrative in past tense.\\n   - The rest of the sentence reads well and supports the reflective tone.\\n\\n4) Original: “By spring I was jogging, then I am running.”\\n   Suggested edit: “By spring, I was jogging; then I was running.”\\n   Reasoning:\\n   - Make both verbs past tense for consistency.\\n   - Use a semicolon to add sentence variety and show progression.\\n   - Keep “then” to maintain your original timeline without adding specifics.\\n\\n5) Original: “Joining track taught me to measure progress in millimeters before it shows up as miles.”\\n   Suggested edit (Option A, fully past tense): “Joining track taught me to measure progress in millimeters before it showed up as miles.”\\n   Suggested edit (Option B, reflective present perfect): “Joining track has taught me to measure progress in millimeters before it shows up as miles.”\\n   Reasoning:\\n   - Option A keeps the entire piece in past tense.\\n   - Option B shifts to present reflection at the end, which can feel more hopeful and ongoing. Choose based on your preference and teacher guidelines.\\n\\nStructural Suggestions\\n- Keep this as one cohesive paragraph for a portfolio, but ensure the chronology is crystal clear:\\n  1) Hook with the ankle-break/decision sentence.\\n  2) Describe the fall (winter → stairs → invisible ice → fall).\\n  3) Move to physical therapy and the patience lesson.\\n  4) Mark progress (spring → jogging → running).\\n  5) Conclude with the broader takeaway about measuring progress (either in past tense or present perfect).\\n- Consider adding one brief transition phrase between therapy and spring to smooth the time jump, e.g., “After weeks of exercises,” only if it’s accurate to your experience. If not, the current “By spring…” works.\\n- If you expand this for a longer essay, split into two paragraphs: (1) incident and decision; (2) recovery and lesson.\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement\\n- Clarify “limping”: If you were limping before the fall, a brief clarification would prevent confusion. If you weren’t, consider “walking carefully” or “moving slowly” (only if true).\\n- Add one reflective phrase to deepen the hopeful tone without inventing events, e.g., “steady, patient steps” or “small gains that mattered”—only if these match your experience.\\n- Vary sentence openings to avoid repetition (start one sentence with a time phrase, another with a participial phrase, etc.). The edits above already introduce some of this variety.\\n\\nFormatting Guidance\\n- For a standard essay paragraph in a portfolio:\\n  - Use Times New Roman or a similar serif font, 12-point, double-spaced, with 1-inch margins.\\n  - Indent the first line of the paragraph.\\n  - Keep consistent tense choice: either all past, or past with a final present-perfect reflection.\\n  - Include a strong concluding sentence that ties the learning to your growth as a student/athlete.\\n\\nWould you like me to rewrite the paragraph with these edits applied? I can provide two versions (all past tense vs. ending in present perfect) so you can choose which fits your portfolio.\\n\\nIf helpful now, here are both edited versions:\\n\\nVersion A (all past tense):\\n“The day I broke my ankle was the day I decided to join track—a choice that makes more sense once I explain. Last winter, I was limping down the stairs when I hit invisible ice, and I fell. Later, in physical therapy, I learned patience I didn’t know I had. By spring, I was jogging; then I was running.

I’ll provide suggestions for both so you can choose.\\n\\nOverview of editorial guidance\\n- I’ll review each sentence line-by-line for spelling (UK vs US), punctuation, and minor grammar.\\n- I’ll flag optional style tweaks that could refine clarity or tone, without changing your voice.\\n- I’ll include UK formatting guidance for a short reflective paragraph addressed to a teacher.\\n\\nOverall Feedback\\n- The paragraph is clear, calm, and reflective—well suited to a UK teacher audience.\\n- Your British spellings are consistent and correct (realised, favourite, programme, organise, colour-coded).\\n- Punctuation and sentence structure are sound. Only optional refinements are worth considering (e.g., tense alignment or word choice like achievable vs possible).\\n\\nSpelling Edits (line-by-line with UK vs US notes)\\n1) “I realised that my favourite part of the programme was how it helped me organise my thoughts.”\\n   - realised (UK) vs realized (US): correct UK.\\n   - favourite (UK) vs favorite (US): correct UK.\\n   - programme (UK, for a course/series) vs program (US): correct UK.\\n   - organise (UK -ise) vs organize (US -ize): correct UK.\\n   - No spelling changes needed.\\n\\n2) “It wasn’t glamorous, but the colour-coded cards made revision feel possible again.”\\n   - colour-coded (UK) vs color-coded (US): correct UK.\\n   - No spelling changes needed.\\n\\n3) “If I can keep this habit, I’ll be more consistent next term.”\\n   - No UK/US spelling differences present; all correct.\\n\\nGrammar Edits (line-by-line with reasoning)\\n1) “I realised that my favourite part of the programme was how it helped me organise my thoughts.”\\n   - Grammatically correct. Optional: “the way it helped me organise my thoughts” can sound slightly more formal than “how,” but both are fine.\\n   - Optional tense alignment (if you want immediacy): “I’ve realised that my favourite part of the programme is the way it helps me organise my thoughts.” This shifts to present-perfect and present tense to emphasise a current insight.\\n\\n2) “It wasn’t glamorous, but the colour-coded cards made revision feel possible again.”\\n   - Correct use of comma before “but” to join two independent clauses.\\n   - Optional word choice: “achievable” or “manageable” may be slightly stronger than “possible,” as they imply practicality rather than mere possibility.\\n\\n3) “If I can keep this habit, I’ll be more consistent next term.”\\n   - Correct comma after the introductory clause.\\n   - If you mean commitment rather than ability, consider: “If I keep this habit, I’ll be more consistent next term.” Using “can” emphasises ability; omitting it emphasises intention.\\n\\nStructural Suggestions\\n- For a short reflective paragraph, your three-sentence structure is effective: past insight → practical method → forward-looking goal.\\n- If you prefer a tighter tense flow, consider making all sentences present-focused: “I’ve realised… It isn’t… If I keep…”. This presents the reflection as current and ongoing. Otherwise, the original past-to-future progression is perfectly fine.\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement\\n- Strengthen specificity slightly: “colour-coded cards” could briefly note purpose (e.g., “colour-coded cue cards for topics and formulas”) if you want to show method, but this is optional given the paragraph’s brevity.\\n- Word choice: swap “possible” for “achievable” or “manageable” to underscore practicality.\\n\\nFormatting Guidance (UK conventions)\\n- Paragraph length: one compact paragraph is appropriate; keep it to 3–5 sentences for clarity.\\n- Hyphenation: “colour-coded” is correctly hyphenated as a compound adjective before the noun.\\n- Apostrophes: “wasn’t” and “I’ll” are correctly contracted; use smart (curly) apostrophes if typesetting permits, but straight apostrophes are fine for plain text.\\n- Quotation marks: use single quotes for quoted words/phrases if needed (UK convention), though none are required here.\\n- Spacing and punctuation: one space after full stops; avoid extra spaces before commas/full stops.\\n- Maintain -ise/-yse spellings consistently in future writing (organise, analyse) to match UK preference.\\n\\nWould you like anything else?\\n- Would you like me to keep the original tense, or rewrite with the present-perfect immediacy?\\n- Do you prefer “achievable” or “manageable” instead of “possible”?\\n\\nOffer to generate the edited text\\n- Minimal-edit version (keeping your tone and structure, with one optional word choice):\\n  “I realised that my favourite part of the programme was how it helped me organise my thoughts. It wasn’t glamorous, but the colour-coded cards made revision feel achievable again. If I can keep this habit, I’ll be more consistent next term.”\\n- Present-focused alternative (for immediacy and tense alignment):\\n  “I’ve realised that my favourite part of the programme is the way it helps me organise my thoughts. It isn’t glamorous, but the colour-coded cards make revision feel achievable again. If I keep this habit, I’ll be more consistent next term.”\\n\\nTell me which version you prefer, and I can finalise and format it accordingly.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"testinput\": \"goals: Clean up comma splices and run-ons; strengthen thesis and paragraphing; fix spelling\\ntype_of_writing: compare-and-contrast essay excerpt\\ntarget_audience: high school English teacher\\nfeedback_focus: line-by-line edits with reasoning; structural suggestions for compare/contrast (block vs point-by-point)\\nformatting: MLA basics\\ntone_preferences: balanced, analytical\\nconstraints: keep examples; do not add sources\\ntext: While ebooks are convenient because you can carry many in one device, print books have advantages too, they are easier on the eyes and don’t need batteries.

Suggested outline:\\n  - Thesis: Establish conditional judgment based on purpose (portability vs deep reading).\\n  - Point 1: Portability — e-books excel; print books are limited.\\n  - Point 2: Readability/eye comfort — print books often easier on the eyes; screens can strain.\\n  - Point 3: Annotation — screen highlighting can become excessive; paper slows you down and adds focus.\\n  - Point 4: Power dependence — e-books require batteries; print books do not.\\n  - Conclusion: The preferable format depends on whether the goal is quick access or sustained, attentive reading.\\n- Block structure (all e-book points, then all print points) can work for longer essays, but with your focused criteria, point-by-point will keep comparisons clear and analytical.\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement\\n- Strengthen the thesis to name the criteria and the conditional choice (e.g., convenience vs comprehension).\\n- Maintain parallelism when listing advantages (e.g., “easier on the eyes and independent of batteries”).\\n- Consider reducing first-person if your teacher prefers objectivity: “On screens, highlighting often becomes excessive…” instead of “I highlight too much.”\\n- Vary sentence starts (not all with “Also” or “Ultimately”) and use transitions like “Moreover,” “In contrast,” “However.”\\n\\nFormatting Guidance (MLA basics)\\n- Use 12-point Times New Roman, double-spaced, 1-inch margins.\\n- Header: Your Name, Teacher’s Name, Course, Date (in day month year), top left.\\n- Page numbers: Last name and page number in the upper right header.\\n- Title: Centered, standard capitalization, no bold/underline.\\n- Avoid contractions; use present tense consistently for general comparisons.\\n- No sources needed here—so no in-text citations or Works Cited for this excerpt.\\n\\nWould you like me to keep first-person examples or shift them to a more objective tone?\\n\\nEdited text options\\n\\nOption A: Minimal changes (keeps your voice)\\n- “While e-books are convenient because you can carry many on one device, print books also have advantages: they are easier on the eyes and do not need batteries. Also, annotations feel different: on a screen, I tend to highlight too much, and the highlighting loses its meaning; with paper, I slow down more. Ultimately, both formats can be effective, but the better choice depends on the reader and the purpose.”\\n\\nOption B: More formal, thesis-forward (reduced first-person)\\n- “While e-books offer superior portability, print books provide greater eye comfort and require no batteries.

The example (“bus schedules” app) nicely shows collaboration; keep it immediately after the quote for impact.\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement\\n- Attribution variety: After first mention, use “Johnson said” instead of “she said” to align with AP style and clarity (especially if multiple speakers appear later).\\n- Specifics: If available, add details like meeting times (“Wednesdays after school”), location (room number), or outcomes (e.g., whether the app is used by students). This deepens the profile without changing the quotes.\\n- Respectful portrayal: “Diverse backgrounds and abilities” is good; avoid phrasing that implies deficit (e.g., “struggling kids”). Your current language is respectful—just keep it consistent.\\n\\nFormatting Guidance (AP style)\\n- Quotes and attribution:\\n  - Use double quotation marks.\\n  - Place periods and commas inside quotation marks.\\n  - Preferred format when splitting a quote: “Sentence,” Johnson said. “Second sentence.”\\n  - Keep the interviewee’s words exactly as spoken; you may break long quotes around the attribution without changing the words.\\n- Courtesy titles:\\n  - AP style typically avoids courtesy titles; use “Johnson” after first reference. If your school’s style uses “Ms.” for teachers, keep it consistently.\\n- Numbers:\\n  - Spell out one through nine; use numerals for 10 and above.\\n  - Use numerals for time and dates (e.g., 3 p.m., Sept. 21).\\n- Hyphenation:\\n  - “after-school” is hyphenated when used as a compound modifier (“after-school coding club”).\\n- Job descriptions:\\n  - Lowercase generic titles after names (“math teacher”) unless used before a name as a formal title (e.g., “Principal Maria Lopez”).\\n- Composition:\\n  - Keep paragraphs concise; one to three sentences per graf is fine for school newspaper style.\\n\\nWould you like me to incorporate these edits into a clean, AP-style version?\\n\\nProposed edited version (quotes kept verbatim):\\nMs. Johnson, a veteran and math teacher, started the after-school coding club to support students who feel left out of technology. “Everybody can learn to code,” she said. “We just need a place to try and fail safely.” The club includes students with diverse backgrounds and abilities, and members pair up to solve small problems.

For example, merge sentences 2 and 3:  \\n  “Weather is affecting farmers a lot, and the data I’ve collected are scattered; I plan to add more later.”  \\n  – This reduces choppiness and connects ideas clearly.  \\n• Introduce context at the start: briefly define why climate change matters to farmers before stating the problem.  \\n• End with a transitional sentence that previews what data or examples you’ll include next, giving the paragraph more purpose.\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement  \\n• Add a concrete example or statistic to illustrate how weather patterns have shifted (e.g., “last year’s drought cost Midwestern farmers X billion dollars”).  \\n• Use a more engaging opening—perhaps a short scenario or a startling fact.  \\n• Include a clear thesis or purpose sentence stating what you intend this essay to show or argue.\\n\\nFormatting Guidance  \\n• For a general-public essay, keep paragraphs around 3–5 sentences.  \\n• Use consistent tense (present tense when discussing current effects).  \\n• If you quote data or reports later, follow a simple citation style (e.g., “According to USDA (2023)…”).  \\n• Leave a blank line between paragraphs for readability online.\\n\\nWould you like me to produce a fully revised version of your paragraph incorporating these edits and suggestions?

Both verbs should match in tense, so use “finished” (tense consistency).\\n\\n• “Running quickly, the finish line seemed far.”  \\n  – Corrected: “As I ran quickly, the finish line seemed far away.”  \\n  – Issue: dangling modifier. The original makes the “finish line” do the running. By naming “I” as the runner, the meaning is clear (clarity).\\n\\n• “The team were excited, we celebrated and it was great.”  \\n  – Corrected: “The team was excited. We celebrated, and it was great.”  \\n  – Issue: subject-verb agreement (“team” is singular in American English) and comma splice. Splitting into two sentences or using a semicolon prevents the run-on (grammar, style).\\n\\nStructural Suggestions  \\n• Begin with a brief context sentence. For example, start with “When I completed the final draft of my project report, I felt a mix of relief and pride.” This sets up what follows (coherence).  \\n• Combine or expand reflections. After noting success, add a sentence on what you learned: “This process taught me the importance of time management and peer feedback.” This deepens the essay’s reflective purpose (development).  \\n• End with a concluding thought. Rather than stopping at celebration, finish by linking back to your growth: “Overall, the experience has made me more confident in handling complex tasks.” A conclusion gives closure (flow).\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement  \\n• Clarity: Specify which part of the project challenged you most.  \\n• Evidence: Give one concrete example of feedback you received or a problem you solved.  \\n• Transitions: Use words such as “then,” “next,” or “finally” to guide the reader through your steps.  \\n• Tone: Since this is for your teacher, a slightly more formal voice—avoiding “it was great”—can strengthen your professionalism.\\n\\nFormatting Guidance  \\n• Paragraphing: Group related ideas into one paragraph—context and your action in the first, reflection and conclusion in the second.  \\n• Title: Add a clear heading like “Reflections on My Project Experience.”  \\n• Spacing: Leave a blank line between paragraphs for readability.  \\n• If you reference any sources or feedback, use a simple citation style (teacher’s preference) like parentheses or footnotes.\\n\\nWould you like me to generate a revised version of your text incorporating these suggestions?

Because your piece is a narrative essay for general readers, we’ll standardize verbs to past tense, replace casual slang with more formal word choices, and suggest ways to arrange your ideas so the story flows clearly from beginning to end.\\n\\nOverall Feedback\\nYour draft shows a lively story idea, but the tense jumps between present, past, and future, which can confuse readers. The tone also shifts from casual (“gonna”) to formal (“felt awesome”), making the voice feel uneven. Focus on telling the events in one consistent tense—past tense works well for a narrative of something that already happened—and choose either a conversational or a more polished style, then stick with it throughout. You can strengthen the flow by ordering your sentences chronologically and grouping your reflections at the end.\\n\\nSpelling Edits\\n• “gonna” → “going to”  \\n  Issue: spelling/slang. Rationale: “gonna” is informal and nonstandard. Use “going to” for clarity and tone consistency.\\n\\nGrammar Edits\\n• “Yesterday I walk to the beach” → “Yesterday I walked to the beach”  \\n  Issue: tense consistency. Rationale: change present “walk” to past “walked” to match a past-tense frame.  \\n\\n• “I am watching the waves” → “I watched the waves”  \\n  Issue: tense consistency. Rationale: shift present continuous to simple past for a uniform past narrative.  \\n\\n• “later I will wrote about it” → “later I will write about it” or “later I wrote about it”  \\n  Issue: incorrect verb form. Rationale: “wrote” is past; with “will,” you need the base form “write.” If you want a pure past narrative, choose “later I wrote about it.”  \\n\\n• “I'm gonna add more details” → “I added more details” or “I was going to add more details”  \\n  Issue: tense and style. Rationale: replace slang and match past tense (“added”) or use the full phrase “going to” with past (“I was going to add”).  \\n\\n• “it felt awesome, but the structure is all over the place” → “it felt awesome, but the structure was all over the place”  \\n  Issue: tense consistency. Rationale: change present “is” to past “was.”  \\n\\n• “I start with the ending” → “I started with the ending”  \\n  Issue: tense consistency. Rationale: change present “start” to past “started.”  \\n\\n• “The style switches between casual and formal.” → “The style switched between casual and formal.”  \\n  Issue: tense consistency. Rationale: change present “switches” to past “switched.”\\n\\nStructural Suggestions\\n• Reorder chronologically: begin with “Yesterday I walked to the beach and watched the waves,” then explain what you did next. Rationale: a clear timeline helps readers follow the story.  \\n• Group your writing reflections at the end: move comments about structure and tone after the action. Rationale: separating the narrative from your analysis keeps the story focused and then allows a tidy reflection.  \\n• Consider combining short, related sentences: for example, merge details about adding material and feeling excitement (“I added more details because I felt awesome”) for stronger flow. Rationale: avoids choppy rhythm and reinforces connection between ideas.\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement\\n• Add sensory details: describe the color of the water, the sound of waves, or the smell of salt air. Rationale: engages readers and brings the scene to life.  \\n• Use transitions: words like “then,” “afterward,” or “later” guide readers through the sequence of events. Rationale: makes the narrative smoother.  \\n• Decide on a tone: if you choose a conversational style, keep contractions like “I’m” but use standard words; if you choose formal, avoid slang entirely. Rationale: consistency in voice builds reader trust.  \\n• Show rather than tell: instead of “it felt awesome,” illustrate why—“The sun warmed my back as I watched the waves crash.” Rationale: creates a vivid picture and deeper connection.\\n\\nFormatting Guidance\\n• Break into paragraphs: start a new paragraph for the beach scene, another for your writing process, and a final one for reflections.  \\n• Indent or add a blank line between paragraphs to signal shifts in focus.  \\n• If this is a submitted essay, double-space your text and use a standard font (Times New Roman, 12 pt) with one-inch margins.  \\n• For the title, center it and use sentence capitalization (e.g., “A Day at the Beach”).\\n\\nWould you like me to generate a revised version of your text that incorporates these suggestions?

You’ll create more impact by:  \\n• Adding essential details (order number, purchase date, product name)  \\n• Using a polite but assertive tone—expressing disappointment without sounding rude  \\n• Structuring your letter into clear paragraphs (introduction, issue description, request, closing)  \\n• Including a proper salutation and sign-off  \\n\\nSpelling Edits  \\n• “broke” → “broken”  \\n  – Issue: spelling/word choice. “Broken” is the correct adjective to describe the product’s condition.  \\n\\nGrammar Edits  \\n• “The product arrived broke.” → “The product arrived broken.”  \\n  – Issue: grammar/word form. Use the past participle “broken” after “arrived.”  \\n• “it do not work” → “it does not work”  \\n  – Issue: subject–verb agreement. With singular “it,” use “does.”  \\n• “please refund.” → “Please issue a refund.”  \\n  – Issue: style/clarity. A more formal phrasing (“issue a refund”) is appropriate in a complaint letter.  \\n• Capitalization of “manager”  \\n  – Issue: style. In a salutation, either capitalize “Manager” if treating it as a title (“Dear Manager,”) or use the person’s name.  \\n\\nStructural Suggestions  \\n• Add your contact and order details at the top (name, address, order number, date)  \\n  – Improves clarity and helps the manager locate your purchase.  \\n• Create three paragraphs:  \\n  1. Opening (reason for writing and reference information)  \\n  2. Problem description (what happened, when, and any supporting details)  \\n  3. Request (what you want the company to do)  \\n  – A clear structure guides the reader through your complaint.  \\n• End with a polite closing (“Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.”) before your sign-off  \\n  – Reinforces a professional tone and indicates what you expect next.  \\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement  \\n• Include specific dates (purchase date, delivery date) to provide context  \\n• Mention any photo attachments or evidence if available  \\n• Use transitional phrases (“Unfortunately,” “However,” “As a result,”) to connect ideas smoothly  \\n• Maintain a firm but courteous tone—avoid phrases that may come across as overly emotional (“very upset”)  \\n\\nFormatting Guidance  \\n• Use a standard business-letter layout:  \\n  – Your address and date at the top  \\n  – Recipient’s name and address below that  \\n  – A clear subject line (e.g., “Subject: Request for Refund—Order #12345”)  \\n• Single-space within paragraphs and double-space between them  \\n• Use a simple, readable font (e.g., Arial or Times New Roman, 11–12 pt)  \\n• Include a proper sign-off (“Sincerely,”) followed by your typed name  \\n\\nWould you like me to produce a revised version of your letter that incorporates these suggestions?

The focus areas are clarity of your main argument (that homework is necessary but needs balance), a strong opening and logical flow, correct grammar and sentence structure, and formatting that suits an oral presentation.  \\n\\nOverall Feedback  \\n• Your core idea—that homework teaches responsibility but must be balanced—is clear and relevant to teachers and administrators.  \\n• Right now the text reads as one long sentence and uses a comma splice, which can distract listeners. Breaking it into shorter, well-punctuated statements will help your audience follow you.  \\n• Strengthen your persuasive appeal by adding specific examples or data and by using a logical order: introduce the problem, present your stance, support it with evidence, then propose a balanced solution.  \\n• A more conversational tone (with rhetorical questions or a personal anecdote) will engage the teachers and principal while still sounding respectful and professional.  \\n\\nSpelling Edits  \\n• No misspelled words found in the provided text.  \\n\\nGrammar Edits  \\n• Comma splice in “Students are complaining about too much homework, I argue that homework is necessary…”  \\n  – Suggested fix: “Students are complaining about too much homework. I argue that homework is necessary…”  \\n  – Issue: punctuation/grammar. Splitting into two sentences or using a semicolon prevents a run-on structure.  \\n• Subject-verb agreement in “we needs balance.”  \\n  – Suggested fix: “we need balance.”  \\n  – Issue: grammar. The plural subject “we” requires the verb “need,” not “needs.”  \\n• Parallel structure for clarity: “homework is necessary but also we need balance.”  \\n  – Suggested fix: “homework is necessary, but balance is also important.”  \\n  – Issue: style. Matching grammatical patterns makes your message crisper and easier to follow.  \\n\\nStructural Suggestions  \\n• Split into clear parts:  \\n  1. Introduction (state the issue: student concerns)  \\n  2. Argument (importance of homework)  \\n  3. Evidence (examples or research on benefits)  \\n  4. Counterpoint (risks of too much homework)  \\n  5. Balanced solution (your proposal)  \\n  – Explanation: A five-part structure keeps your audience oriented and builds a logical case.  \\n• Move your thesis (“homework is necessary but needs balance”) to the end of the introduction for maximum impact.  \\n  – Explanation: Placing the thesis last in the intro creates a strong “what to expect” moment for listeners.  \\n• Combine short supporting points into bullet-style notes (for your speaker outline) rather than one dense sentence.  \\n  – Explanation: This makes it easier to rehearse and deliver key ideas clearly.  \\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement  \\n• Add a brief anecdote or rhetorical question at the start (“Have you ever wondered why homework feels overwhelming?”) to draw in your audience.  \\n• Include one or two statistics or examples (e.g., average homework hours, studies on effectiveness) to strengthen your argument.  \\n• Use transitions (“First,” “Furthermore,” “However,” “In conclusion”) to guide the listener through each part of your speech.  \\n• Address possible objections (e.g., “Some might say less homework lowers grades—here’s why that isn’t necessarily true”).  \\n• End with a call to action directed at the committee (e.g., “I invite you to adopt a balanced homework policy…”).  \\n\\nFormatting Guidance  \\n• Break your speech into labeled sections in your speaker notes: Introduction, Main Points, Counterargument, Conclusion.  \\n• Use bullet points or numbered lists for your main talking points—these are cues, not full sentences.  \\n• Keep each line on your note card or slide to one idea, so you don’t read a wall of text.  \\n• If you include a quotation or statistic, format it in quotation marks or italics and note the source briefly.  \\n• Leave white space on your notes for quick annotations or emphasis marks during delivery.  \\n\\nWould you like me to generate a revised version of your speech draft that incorporates these changes?  \\nWould you also like further assistance, additional changes, or more guidance?\",\n    \"coverageEvalText\": \"Comprehensive, well-structured feedback matching all required categories and tone.\\n\\nOK\",\n    \"coverage\": \"ok\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"a7684fe\",\n    \"promptid\": \"b7651b1\",\n    \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n    \"testuid\": \"test-25945485\",\n    \"baseline\": false,\n    \"ruleid\": 15,\n    \"rule\": \"The output must include a closing question that asks whether the user would like further assistance, additional changes, or more guidance.\",\n    \"inverse\": false,\n    \"input\": \"instructions: Provide detailed 'Spelling Edits' with bullet points naming misspellings and corrected spellings.; writing type: narrative; writing: I went to the libary to meet my freind.

Right now, spelling errors distract the reader from the content. Once spelling is fixed, you can consider adding small details (time of day, why you were excited) to make the narrative more engaging. The tone is conversational and works well for a personal narrative.\\n\\nSpelling Edits  \\n- “libary” → “library”  \\n  Issue type: spelling. “Library” is the correct standard spelling.  \\n- “freind” → “friend”  \\n  Issue type: spelling. “Friend” follows the i-before-e rule.  \\n- “definetly” → “definitely”  \\n  Issue type: spelling. The correct form has an extra “i” after the n.  \\n- “suprise” → “surprise”  \\n  Issue type: spelling. The correct form drops the extra “u” after the s.\\n\\nGrammar Edits  \\n- “they didn’t show” → “they didn’t show up”  \\n  Issue type: grammar/clarity. Adding “up” completes the phrasal verb and sounds more natural.  \\n- Pronoun clarity “they”  \\n  Issue type: clarity. “They” works fine as a gender-neutral singular pronoun. If you know your friend’s gender and prefer “he” or “she,” you could swap that pronoun for precision.\\n\\nStructural Suggestions  \\n- Combine for emphasis:  \\n  Suggested change: “To my surprise, when I went to the library to meet my friend, they didn’t show up.”  \\n  Benefit: Opens with the surprise, then fills in context, creating a stronger hook and smoother flow.  \\n- Expand emotional detail:  \\n  After the second sentence, you might add a line about how you felt—confused, disappointed, or worried—to deepen reader engagement.\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement  \\n- Add sensory details (What did the library smell or sound like?) to ground readers in the scene.  \\n- Show, don’t tell: Instead of “It was definitely a surprise,” you could describe your heart racing or your eyes scanning the empty bench.  \\n- Provide brief backstory: Why did you choose that time or place?

Picking a single tense (past for “yesterday” stories) will strengthen clarity.  \\n• The shift from slang (“we be shopping”) to more formal phrasing feels abrupt. Deciding on one tone—casual or formal—and sticking with it will make the writing flow better.  \\n• The structure is very brief and reads like a series of notes.

(Spelling—everything is spelled correctly.)\\n\\nGrammar Edits  \\n• “Yesterday I go to market” → “Yesterday I went to the market.”  \\n  – Issue: tense consistency and missing article (the). You describe a past event, so use past tense “went” and include “the” before “market.”  \\n• “we be shopping” → “we were shopping.”  \\n  – Issue: dialect/tense. Standard past continuous form is “were shopping,” which matches the past-tense narrative.  \\n• “The essay jump around” → “The essay jumps around.”  \\n  – Issue: subject-verb agreement and tense. The subject “essay” is singular, so the verb needs –s (“jumps”), and present tense can work if you’re describing the essay’s general behavior.  \\n• “I write in casual slang, then formal.” → “I write in casual slang, then switch to a formal tone.”  \\n  – Issue: clarity and style. Adding “switch to” and “tone” clearly signals the shift and makes the sentence more precise.\\n\\nStructural Suggestions  \\n• Start with a clear topic sentence: introduce what you’ll discuss (e.g., “Yesterday, I visited the market, but I struggled to keep my writing style consistent.”). This frames the piece.  \\n• Combine or expand: Rather than four separate fragments, expand each idea into its own sentence or two. For example, describe what happened at the market in one paragraph, then reflect on your writing style in the next.  \\n• Add a conclusion: Wrap up by stating what you learned (e.g., “I realized that maintaining a single tense and tone helps my readers follow my story.”). This gives your piece a sense of closure.\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement  \\n• Transitions: Use words like “First,” “Next,” and “Finally” or phrases like “However” and “As a result” to guide readers smoothly from one point to the next.  \\n• Detail and examples: Describe what you bought at the market or why you switched styles mid-essay to make your account more engaging.  \\n• Tone consistency: Decide if you want a conversational or formal essay. If conversational, you can keep some slang but adjust spellings to match standard English rules. If formal, remove all slang.\\n\\nFormatting Guidance  \\n• Paragraphing: Group related sentences into paragraphs (e.g., one for the market story, one for style reflection).  \\n• Headings (for longer essays): If this grows into a longer piece, use headings like “Market Visit” and “Style Reflection” to organize content.  \\n• Spacing: Leave a blank line between paragraphs for readability.  \\n• Consistent punctuation: Make sure each sentence ends with a period, question mark, or exclamation point.\\n\\nWould you like me to produce a fully rewritten version of your text that incorporates these suggestions?

To strengthen this argument, restate your claim with correct grammar, split it into shorter sentences, and follow up immediately with facts or examples. Then use linking words to smooth the transition between ideas. Finally, maintain a consistent, slightly formal tone throughout.  \\n\\nSpelling Edits  \\n• No misspelled words were found in your text.  \\n\\nGrammar Edits  \\n• “The argument say climate change is real” → “The argument says that climate change is real”  \\n  – Issue: subject-verb agreement (grammar). “Argument” is singular, so the verb needs an “s.” Also adding “that” improves clarity.  \\n• “but I don’t provide any data” → “but it does not provide any data”  \\n  – Issue: pronoun reference and voice consistency (grammar). Shifting from “I” to “it” keeps the focus on the argument itself rather than the writer.  \\n• “and the paragraphs is choppy.” → “and the paragraphs are choppy.”  \\n  – Issue: number agreement (grammar). “Paragraphs” is plural, so use “are.”  \\n\\nStructural Suggestions  \\n• Break into two or more sentences:  \\n  – Suggestion: Move “However” to the start of the second sentence for a clear contrast.  \\n  – How it helps: Shorter sentences improve readability and emphasize each point.  \\n• Reorder for emphasis:  \\n  – Suggestion: First state the claim, then note the lack of data, then mention flow issues.  \\n  – How it helps: A logical sequence (claim → evidence gap → flow issue) makes your critique easier to follow.  \\n• Expand each point into its own sentence or paragraph:  \\n  – Suggestion: After noting “no data,” immediately follow with an example or placeholder where you will insert statistics.  \\n  – How it helps: Separating ideas gives you room to develop each one fully.  \\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement  \\n• Clarity: Define what “the argument” refers to—yours, someone else’s, or a general claim.  \\n• Evidence: Add specific data (e.g., “According to the IPCC, global temperatures have risen by 1.1 °C since pre-industrial times.”)  \\n• Examples: Reference a particular study, event, or statistic to illustrate real-world impact (for instance, melting glaciers in Greenland).  \\n• Transitions: Use words like “however,” “furthermore,” or “in addition” to link ideas and guide the reader.  \\n• Tone: Adopt a formal, objective style—avoid contractions (“does not” instead of “don’t”) and keep to third person.  \\n\\nFormatting Guidance  \\n• Paragraphing: Keep each main idea in its own paragraph (claim, evidence, flow critique).  \\n• Headings (if this is part of a longer essay): Use clear labels such as Introduction, Evidence, Discussion, Conclusion.  \\n• Citations: When you add data, follow a consistent style (APA, MLA, or Chicago) for in-text citations and a reference list.  \\n• Spacing and indentation: Use standard double-spacing and indent the first line of each paragraph if this is a school assignment.  \\n\\nCould you tell me more about your goals for this piece (audience, purpose) and what kind of feedback you’d like?

Strengthening sensory details and varying sentence length will heighten the whimsy. Clear, consistent tense and polished dialogue punctuation will help readers stay grounded in your narrator’s perspective and feel more connected to the moment at the arcade.\\n\\nSpelling Edits  \\n• No spelling errors detected. (Spelling: the text’s word choices are correct.)\\n\\nGrammar Edits  \\n• “I walk into the old arcade last night” → “I walked into the old arcade last night.”  \\n  – Issue: tense consistency. You mix present (“walk”) with past (“last night”). Changing “walk” to “walked” keeps past tense throughout the narration.  \\n• “You coming?” Jay says, but I was already at the claw machine… → Separate into two sentences or use a semicolon. For example: “You coming?” Jay says. I was already at the claw machine…  \\n  – Issue: run-on sentence and dialogue tag punctuation. Ending the quote with a question mark should be followed by a closing quote and then a period or new sentence before continuing.  \\n• “I am thinking this is silly and then the claw was moving” → “I think this is silly, and then the claw moved”  \\n  – Issue: tense consistency and clarity. Changing “am thinking” to simple present (“think”) or past (“thought”) and “was moving” to “moved” aligns your verbs.  \\n• “The whale slips, then it slip again” → “The whale slips, then it slips again.”  \\n  – Issue: subject‐verb agreement. “It slip” should be “it slips” to match singular subject “whale.”  \\n• “I drop the token. It clatters. I am thinking…” → consider merging: “I drop the token; it clatters, and I think…”  \\n  – Issue: choppy sentence rhythm. Using a semicolon or conjunction binds related actions for smoother flow.\\n\\nStructural Suggestions  \\n• Break into paragraphs for better pacing:  \\n  – Paragraph 1: station arrival and mood (lines about lights buzzing, dusty air).  \\n  – Paragraph 2: Jay’s dialogue and your diversion to the claw machine.  \\n  – Paragraph 3: dropping the token and the machine’s action.  \\n  This separation guides the reader through each beat of the scene and prevents short sentences from running together.  \\n• Rearrange sensory details to “show” more: start with a small action (like flicking a coin into your palm) before describing smells. This grounds the narrator’s body in the scene, then expands to scent and sound.  \\n• Introduce internal reflection after action: rather than “I am thinking this is silly” in the middle, you might pause after the claw moves to let the narrator’s thoughts unfold, then return to action. That variation pulls readers deeper into the reflective voice.\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement  \\n• Show vs. tell: replace “the air smells of dust and coins” with a brief image, e.g., “I can taste the powdery dust on my tongue and hear the soft jingle of loose change.”  \\n• Emotional stakes: hint at why the plush whale matters—does it remind the narrator of someone or something? A sentence or two of backstory will deepen engagement.  \\n• Vary sentence length: mix short, punchy lines with longer, flowing ones to reflect that whimsical tone and keep readers on their toes.\\n\\nFormatting Guidance  \\n• Use standard manuscript format: 12-point Courier or Times New Roman, double-spaced, one-inch margins.  \\n• Dialogue formatting: start a new line each time the speaker changes.  \\n• Page header: include your last name/scene title and page number in the upper right.  \\n• Indent first line of each paragraph by ½ inch—don’t add extra spaces between paragraphs in double-spaced prose.\\n\\nWould you like me to produce a fully revised version of your scene incorporating these edits?

At first, I felt small in those offices, like I was pretending to be older. Over time, I realized I was learning a language of responsibility. When my mom’s small catering business almost closed during the pandemic, I made flyers, wrote emails, and built a simple website on my cracked phone. It wasn’t perfect, but it worked, and we kept going. This taught me how community isn’t a slogan; it’s people showing up for each other. I still worry about sounding “right,” but I’ve learned to ask questions and keep trying even when I’m unsure. College, to me, is a place to grow that force of trying into something that can help others, especially families navigating systems that pretend to be simple.\",\n    \"validityText\": \"The input is a user-provided piece of prose (a college application personal statement) accompanied by meta-instructions (goals, type_of_writing, target audience, feedback focus, formatting, tone preferences, constraints), all of which are explicitly permitted by the specification.\\n\\nOK\",\n    \"validity\": \"ok\",\n    \"coverageText\": \"Overview  \\nBased on your goals—to strengthen the narrative arc and clarity while preserving your authentic voice in a college-application personal statement—this edit focuses on:  \\n- Maintaining your sincere, reflective, confident (but humble) tone  \\n- Preserving cultural and personal details without exaggeration  \\n- Clarifying phrasing and tightening language for maximum impact  \\n- Structuring into clear paragraphs under 650 words  \\n\\nOverall Feedback  \\nYour essay offers a compelling snapshot of how you’ve turned real-world challenges into growth. The opening anecdote about translating bank forms immediately establishes your background and responsibility. The pandemic example shows initiative and community values. To strengthen the narrative arc, try tightening some phrases for clarity, breaking the text into distinct paragraphs (introduction, development, reflection, conclusion), and adding a brief detail or two to heighten emotional resonance.

(Style, clarity)  \\n• “For example, checking Twitter every 10 minutes is a bad loop I had.”  \\n  – Revision: “For example, I used to check Twitter every 10 minutes, which created a distracting loop.”  \\n  – Reason: clarifies subject and improves readability. (Clarity, grammar)  \\n• “Perfectionism is a trap. If you schedule shorter blocks and accept B+ work at first, you will move faster.”  \\n  – Revision: “Perfectionism is a trap. By scheduling shorter work blocks and accepting B+ quality at first, you’ll move faster.”  \\n  – Reason: parallel phrasing and contraction for a more conversational tone. (Style, clarity)\\n\\nStructural Suggestions  \\n• Reorder intro to preview all tips: start with a one-sentence hook (“I thought more apps would help…”) then list your three solutions in brief. This orients readers up front. (Coherence, flow)  \\n• Combine the anecdote about Twitter with Tip 1 paragraph to avoid repetition. For example, fold “I used to check Twitter…” directly under the Not-To-Do List heading. (Trimming repetition, coherence)  \\n• Expand Conclusion into a call-to-action: after “you will feel free,” add “Try these steps this week and share your experience in the comments.” This invites engagement. (Reader engagement, flow)  \\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement  \\n• Add a brief personal example under Tip 2 (e.g., a mini case study of a task you completed faster). This strengthens credibility. (Evidence)  \\n• Include a transitional sentence between tips (e.g., “Once you’ve set boundaries with a Not-To-Do List, the next step…”). This improves readability. (Transitions)  \\n• Consider a short bulleted list of “common not-to-do items” (social media, email refresh) to make Tip 1 more actionable. (Clarity, practicality)\\n\\nFormatting Guidance  \\n• Use H2 for main sections (Intro, Tip 1, Tip 2, Conclusion) and H3 or bold for subheadings within tips. This aligns with web style.  \\n• Break paragraphs into 2–3 sentences max. Short blocks aid scanning.  \\n• Convert examples or mini-steps into scannable bullet lists under each tip.  \\n• Keep your links intact but format them as clickable anchor text (e.g., [Your App Review](https://example.com)).  \\n• Add a Table of Contents at the top with jump-links to each H2 to help long-form readers.\\n\\nWould you like me to generate a fully rewritten version of your blog post draft incorporating these suggestions?

Spell out “seven” (style) and specify “these steps” so the call to action is clear.\\n\\nStructural Suggestions  \\n• Hook → Problem/Evidence: After your hook, add a one-sentence transition like, “Here’s why that matters to all of us.” This will guide listeners into the problem.  \\n• Combine “Problem” and “Evidence”: Rather than separate bullets, narrate: “Over the last year, my average screen time shot up by two hours a day, my grades dipped from a B+ to a B–, and I was waking up exhausted.” This merges evidence and personal anecdote for impact.  \\n• Counterargument placement: Introduce it with “Now, you might be thinking…” This sets up the objection before you refute it.  \\n• Solution expansion: Label each step (“Step 1: Switch to grayscale,” etc.), then add a brief “why this works” sentence under each. That helps fill time and gives classmates context.  \\n• Close with call to action: End with a clear challenge—“Will you join me in regaining control of your attention? Let’s start today, for the next seven days.” This frames the ask as a group effort.\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement  \\n• Add a brief data point or statistic (e.g., average teen screen time) to strengthen your evidence.  \\n• Use a short personal story or visual image to make the problem relatable.  \\n• Include a rhetorical question or quick audience poll (“How many of you check Instagram first thing?”) for engagement.  \\n• Vary sentence length and tone—mix shorter, punchy lines with longer, explanatory ones to maintain interest.\\n\\nFormatting Guidance  \\n• Headings: Label each main section in your notes—HOOK, PROBLEM, EVIDENCE, COUNTERARGUMENT, SOLUTION, CALL TO ACTION.  \\n• Cue words: Insert [PAUSE] after your hook, [EMPHASIZE] before a key fact, [LOOK AROUND] when engaging classmates.  \\n• Spacing: Leave one line blank between sections so you can turn pages without losing your place.  \\n• Indentation: Use bullet points for sub-ideas under each heading, and number your three steps clearly.  \\n• Timing notes: In the margin, jot time targets (e.g., “1 min for Hook,” “2 min for Evidence”) to stay within 5–6 minutes.\\n\\nWould you like me to generate a rewritten version of your speech outline incorporating all these suggestions?

The feedback also preserves your reflective, hopeful tone while keeping all major events intact.\\n\\nOverall Feedback  \\n• Chronology and tense consistency: Right now, the narrative shifts between present and past tense and jumps around in time. Converting everything to the past tense and arranging the sentences to follow the actual sequence of events will make the story flow more smoothly for your English class.  \\n• Descriptive clarity: A few concrete details—like how the ice looked or how physical therapy felt—will bring your reflection to life. Short, sensory phrases can deepen the reader’s connection.  \\n• Sentence variety: You open several sentences with “I.” Varying your sentence openings and combining some shorter sentences can improve rhythm and keep the reader engaged.  \\n\\nSpelling Edits  \\n• No spelling errors were detected in the provided text.

Converting “am limping” to “was limping” keeps past tense consistent, and restructuring combines two actions for smoother flow.  \\n• “Later, in physical therapy, I learn patience I didn’t know I had.”  \\n  – Suggestion: Change “learn” to “learned.”  \\n  – Issue: tense consistency (grammar). Past tense “learned” matches the timeline.  \\n• “By spring I was jogging, then I am running.”  \\n  – Suggestion: Change “then I am running” to “then I was running.”  \\n  – Issue: tense consistency (grammar). Unifying past tense preserves the retrospective narrative.  \\n• “The day I broke my ankle is the day I decided to join track, which doesn’t make sense until I explain.”  \\n  – Suggestion: Change “doesn’t” to “didn’t,” or consider rephrasing to “may not make sense yet.”  \\n  – Issue: tense consistency (grammar) and tone (clarity). “Didn’t” matches past tense; “yet” softens the transition.  \\n\\nStructural Suggestions  \\n• Open with the fall, then explain the decision:  \\n  – Move “The day I broke my ankle…” after your vivid description of slipping on ice. This anchors the reader in the moment before revealing your decision to join track.  \\n• Group the rehabilitation details into one paragraph:  \\n  – Combine “Later, in physical therapy…” with a few extra descriptive sentences about your exercises or feelings. This makes the therapy phase feel more cohesive.  \\n• Conclude with a reflective summary:  \\n  – After “Joining track taught me…,” add a brief reflection sentence that ties back to hope or future goals. This bookends your narrative with the reflective, hopeful tone you want.  \\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement  \\n• Add sensory details: Describe the sharp sting of cold air in your lungs as you fell or the squeak of sneakers on the track.  \\n• Vary sentence length: Mix one- or two-word exclamations (“Ouch!”) or questions (“Could I do this?”) with longer, flowing sentences for emphasis.  \\n• Strengthen transitions: Use words like “after,” “soon,” or “as a result” to show cause and effect between injury, therapy, and joining track.  \\n\\nFormatting Guidance  \\n• Paragraphs:  \\n  – Paragraph 1: The fall and decision to join track.  \\n  – Paragraph 2: Physical therapy experience.  \\n  – Paragraph 3: Returning to running and lesson learned.  \\n• Standard essay style:  \\n  – Double-space your text, use 12-point Times New Roman, and indent the first line of each paragraph.  \\n  – No subheadings—let the flow of your narrative guide the reader.  \\n\\nWould you like me to generate a fully rewritten version of your narrative that incorporates these edits?

Break into paragraphs:  \\n   – Paragraph 1: Introduction of Ms. Johnson and club purpose.  \\n   – Paragraph 2: Include her quote about coding.  \\n   – Paragraph 3: Describe student collaboration and recent project.  \\n   – Paragraph 4: Concluding atmosphere and future plans.  \\n   – Adds visual breaks and logical flow.  \\n3. Close with impact: Add a final quote or statistic about student success or upcoming showcase.  \\n   – Strengthens conclusion and leaves readers with a clear takeaway.\\n\\nOpportunities for Improvement  \\n• Add specific student voices or a short quote (with permission) to illustrate “different backgrounds.”  \\n• Provide concrete examples of problem-solving challenges to deepen reader engagement.  \\n• Use transition words (“For example,” “As a result,” “Next”) for smoother connections between ideas.  \\n• Mention the club’s meeting time or location for practical value to readers.\\n\\nFormatting Guidance  \\n• AP style for titles: Use “Ms. Johnson” on first reference without academic degrees; thereafter use “Johnson.”  \\n• Numbers: Spell out numbers under 10 (e.g., “five students”), use numerals for 10 and above.  \\n• Quotes: Double quotes for all speech; separate distinct sentences into their own quoted blocks with proper attribution.  \\n• Paragraphing: Keep each main idea in its own paragraph.  \\n• Dates/times: Write as “4 p.m. Tuesdays” (lowercase abbreviations, periods in a.m./p.m.).\\n\\nWould you like me to produce a revised version of your text incorporating these edits?

I think that while it helps us communicate, it also make us lonely, because we are scrolling instead of seeing each other. For example, I text my friends daily but I dont see them on weekend, which used to be normal before. This topic is very important because people are getting worse attention span and that affects school.

Results: The solution was heated to 30C, 40C, and 50C and the time to color change were recorded as 45s, 31s, and 19s respectively (see table 1).

At first, I felt small in those offices, like I was pretending to be older. Over time, I realized I was learning a language of responsibility. When my mom’s small catering business almost closed during the pandemic, I made flyers, wrote emails, and built a simple website on my cracked phone. It wasn’t perfect, but it worked, and we kept going. This taught me how community isn’t a slogan; it’s people showing up for each other. I still worry about sounding “right,” but I’ve learned to ask questions and keep trying even when I’m unsure. College, to me, is a place to grow that force of trying into something that can help others, especially families navigating systems that pretend to be simple.\n===\ngoals: Improve word choice, check capitalization and punctuation; preserve line breaks and imagery\ntype_of_writing: poem (free verse)\ntarget_audience: school literary journal\nfeedback_focus: line-by-line edits with reasoning; subtle style suggestions; formatting guidance for line breaks/stanzas\nformatting: poetry conventions (intentional capitalization choices, em-dashes)\ntone_preferences: lyrical, contemplative\nconstraints: maintain metaphors and core images; do not impose rhyme\ntext: the sun dropps behind the hill—\ni chase the day like a late bus,\nshoes unlaced, the gravel keeps my secrets.\nI call the trees my witnesses\nand they don’t answer (they never did)\nbut the leaves clap anyway, a small stadium.\ntomorrow is a folded map in my pocket\nthat I forgot to unfold.\n===\ngoals: Clarify thesis and evaluation criteria; fix grammar and tone; suggest structure\ntype_of_writing: book review\ntarget_audience: classmates and teacher\nfeedback_focus: line-by-line edits with reasoning; structural suggestions (intro-summary-analysis-conclusion); formatting guidance\nformatting: MLA for book titles and quotes\ntone_preferences: analytical yet accessible\nconstraints: include at least one quote; avoid spoilers beyond mid-point\ntext: In The Giver by Lois Lowry, the community seems perfect but actually its not. I liked the way the author use color as a symbol of freedom and choice. When Jonas first sees the apple “change,” it foreshadows him seeing the world differently. The pacing in the middle got slow for me and I think the ending was confusing but good. Overall I would recommend this book because it makes you think about choices and memory and what is price of safety.\n===\ngoals: Improve clarity, consistency, and citation formatting; ensure a coherent argument\ntype_of_writing: history research paper excerpt\ntarget_audience: AP U.S. History teacher\nfeedback_focus: line-by-line grammar and style edits with reasoning; structural suggestions; formatting and citation guidance\nformatting: Chicago Notes-Bibliography (footnotes), page numbers, proper quotation format\ntone_preferences: formal, objective\nconstraints: keep footnote markers [1], [2] as placeholders; do not add sources\ntext: The New Deal did not end the Great Depression; however, it redefined the relationship between citizens and the federal government. Relief agencies were criticized as being both too much and not enough. For example, the CCC created jobs for young men but also reinforced certain gender norms.[1] In addition, some programs excluded domestic workers, which disproportionately impacted Black women.[2] While the scope of reform was unprecedented, the policies had limits that shows the contradictions of the era.\n===\ngoals: Tighten structure, improve headings, and fix grammar; enhance readability for web\ntype_of_writing: blog post draft\ntarget_audience: general readers interested in productivity\nfeedback_focus: line-by-line edits with reasoning; structural suggestions; formatting guidance for headings, lists, and links\nformatting: web style (H2/H3, short paragraphs, scannable bullets)\ntone_preferences: friendly, practical\nconstraints: keep anecdotes but trim repetition; keep links intact\ntext: Title: How I Stopped Procrastinating By Doing Less\nIntro: I used to think I need more apps to fix my procrastination. Turns out, I needed less—less options, less tabs, less guilt.\n## Tip 1: Make a Not-To-Do List\nThis is not negative! It focuses your attention on what you should ignore. For example, checking Twitter every 10 minutes is a bad loop I had.\n## Tip 2: Set \"good enough\" deadlines\nPerfectionism is a trap. If you schedule shorter blocks and accept B+ work at first, you will move faster.\n## Conclusion\nDoing less is surprisingly brave. You will feel weird at first, but then free.\n===\ngoals: Ensure tense consistency and clarity; improve conciseness without losing meaning\ntype_of_writing: scientific abstract\ntarget_audience: science fair judges\nfeedback_focus: line-by-line grammar/style edits with reasoning; structural suggestions (background, methods, results, conclusion)\nformatting: 250-word limit; avoid first person; define acronyms\ntone_preferences: objective, precise\nconstraints: do not change data values or claims\ntext: Plastic waste in waterways is increasing, which is why we designed a low-cost microplastic filter using natural fibers and tested it on local creek samples. We test filtration rates and particle counts with a DIY microscope rig. Results shows a 42% mean reduction in particles >100 μm after 30 minutes, and 18% reduction in 50–100 μm.

Between school, work, and caring for my little brother, I learned to prioritize hard choices. Once, I missed a shift to take him to an appointment and got written up, but I would do it again. I’m not perfect and I still overcommit, but I’ve learned to ask for help and to say no.

Sometimes I say things like “I have 15 years” because that’s how we say it in Spanish, and people laugh a little.

I am limping down the stairs last winter when the ice was invisible, and then I fell. Later, in physical therapy, I learn patience I didn’t know I had. By spring I was jogging, then I am running.

Also I think annotations feel different, on a screen I highlight too much and it loses meaning, with paper I slow down more. Both formats can be good but it depends on the reader and the situation.\n===\ngoals: Improve clarity and specificity; fix article usage and verb forms; suggest a stronger conclusion\ntype_of_writing: film analysis paragraph\ntarget_audience: class blog readers\nfeedback_focus: line-by-line edits with reasoning; structural suggestions; formatting for italics of film titles\nformatting: web post with italics for titles\ntone_preferences: thoughtful, concise\nconstraints: keep chosen scene; no spoilers beyond first 30 minutes\ntext: In the opening of The Martian, the storm scene shows how group decision under pressure can go wrong.

      "groundtruth": "Hi! I’m here to help you edit and improve your writing. I can give line-by-line edits on spelling, grammar, phrasing, and structure, and I can also suggest how to organize your ideas for your audience.\n\nA few quick questions to understand your goals:\n- How long do you want the paragraph to be (one short paragraph or a few)?\n- Do you want it to be informative, persuasive, or both?\n- Should it focus on farmers in a specific region, or be general?\n- Do you plan to include data/statistics, or keep it high-level?\n\nOverview of the approach:\n- I’ll clean up grammar and spelling, tighten phrasing, and make the weather–climate connection clear.\n- I’ll suggest a simple structure: a clear topic sentence, 1–2 supporting points (examples or data), and a concise concluding idea.\n- I’ll offer a polished version you can use or adapt.\n\nOverall Feedback:\n- You’re flagging a timely topic and a clear audience. To make this effective for the general public, avoid meta statements (like “I was going to add more later”) in the final paragraph, and connect weather impacts directly to climate change so the cause-and-effect relationship is clear.\n- Aim for specific examples (droughts, floods, unpredictable seasons) and simple, direct language.\n- Keep tense consistent and avoid filler phrases (“kind of,” “a lot”) unless they add meaning.\n\nSpelling Edits (with explanations):\n- “effecting” → “affecting”\n  - “Affecting” means “influencing or having an impact on.” “Effecting” means “causing to happen,” which isn’t the intended meaning here.\n- “alot” → “a lot”\n  - “A lot” is two words in standard English.\n- “its good” → “it’s good”\n  - Use “it’s” (it is). “Its” is possessive.\n\nGrammar and Phrasing Edits (with explanations):\n- Original: “Weather is effecting farmers alot.”\n  - Suggested: “Extreme weather is affecting farmers a lot.”\n  - Why: Correct spelling and verb; add “Extreme” to be more precise. Consider replacing “a lot” with “significantly” or describing how (e.g., “by reducing yields and raising costs”) for specificity.\n- Original: “The data are scattered and I was going to add more later.”\n  - Suggested (general public style): “The available data are scattered, and I plan to add more later.”\n  - Why: “Plan” keeps tense consistent; “available” clarifies what’s scattered. For a finished essay, remove meta-process notes entirely and present one or two specific data points instead.\n- Original: “It’s kind of messy, and I don’t know if its good.”\n  - Suggested: “It’s a bit messy, and I’m not sure it reads well.”\n  - Why: Replace filler (“kind of”) with “a bit,” correct “it’s,” and be specific about what “good” means (clarity/readability). For the final essay, avoid self-assessment and simply present a clean paragraph.\n\nStructural Suggestions:\n- Use a clear 3–4 sentence structure:\n  1) Topic sentence: connect climate change to weather and farmers.\n  2) Supporting detail: examples of impacts (droughts, floods, unpredictable seasons).\n  3) Optional evidence: one clear statistic or observed trend (cite a credible source if you have one).\n  4) Closing sentence: why it matters or what should happen next (adaptation/support/emissions reductions).\n- Remove meta commentary (“I was going to add more later”) from the final paragraph. Keep that note in your draft, not in the published text.\n\nOpportunities for Improvement:\n- Replace vague phrases (“a lot,” “kind of messy”) with concrete examples.\n- Clarify the weather–climate link (e.g., “Climate change is intensifying extreme weather…”).\n- If you include data, choose one or two key numbers with plain-language context and a source.\n- Use active voice and short sentences to increase readability.\n\nFormatting Guidance:\n- For a short general-public essay, stick to one concise paragraph (3–5 sentences).\n- Use plain language, avoid jargon, and define terms briefly if needed (e.g., “extreme weather”).\n- If you expand to multiple paragraphs, add a short subheading and break up ideas for readability.\n\nWould you like me to rewrite this into a clean, ready-to-share paragraph now? If so, tell me your preferred tone (informative vs. persuasive) and any region or example you want included. Here’s a neutral, general-public example you could use or tweak:\n\nExample revised paragraph:\nClimate change is intensifying extreme weather, and farmers are feeling the effects. Droughts, floods, and unpredictable seasons reduce yields and raise costs, making harvests less reliable and food prices more volatile. Clear, consistent data help us understand these trends, but the takeaway is already clear: we need to support farmers’ adaptation efforts while reducing emissions to limit future damage.\n\nIf you share your target length and any data you want included, I can tailor this further and provide a fully edited version."

If you want a planning sentence, you can instead write: “This essay explains how uniforms curb bullying and supports the claim with evidence from schools and research.” But typically, just use a clear thesis and let the body paragraphs provide support.\n\n3) Original: “I want stronger transitions and a clearer stance.”\n   Suggested edit: Remove from the essay.\n   Why: Also meta-commentary. Replace with an actual clear stance (the revised thesis) and use transitions within and between body paragraphs.\n\nOverall Feedback:\n- Your core claim is solid, but it needs a stronger, more specific thesis that states how uniforms reduce bullying (the mechanism) and previews the points you’ll argue.\n- Remove self-referential sentences from the draft; replace them with argumentative content.\n- Use consistent, active voice and topic sentences that directly support the thesis.\n- Integrate transitions that show logical progression: begin with mechanism, move to evidence, then address counterarguments before concluding.\n\nSpelling Edits:\n- No spelling errors in your text.\n\nGrammar Edits:\n- Add a comma after introductory “However” if you keep that sentence in any future draft: “However, …”\n- Prefer active voice (“schools should require”) over passive (“should be adopted”) for a stronger, more persuasive tone.\n- Avoid first-person meta-statements in an argumentative essay unless your assignment encourages reflection.\n\nStructural Suggestions:\n- Introduction: Hook, brief context, precise thesis.\n- Body paragraph 1 (Mechanism): Explain how uniforms reduce visible status markers and remove appearance-based targets for bullying.\n- Body paragraph 2 (Evidence): Present examples or data from school districts or studies showing reduced bullying incidents after uniform adoption.\n- Body paragraph 3 (Counterargument and rebuttal): Acknowledge concerns (cost, individuality) and rebut with solutions (assistance programs, optional accessories, focus on safety).\n- Conclusion: Restate thesis in fresh words, synthesize key points, and end with a call to action or implication (e.g., schools should pilot uniform policies with equity supports).\n\nOpportunities for Improvement:\n- Define bullying briefly (appearance-based teasing, brand shaming) to focus your claim.\n- Specify the scope (e.g., public middle and high schools) to avoid overgeneralization.\n- Support claims with credible sources (district reports, education research) or real-world examples; avoid overclaiming causation without evidence.\n- Use clear topic sentences that tie directly back to the thesis at the start of each body paragraph.\n- Maintain parallel structure when listing reasons: “reduces status competition, removes appearance-based targets, and fosters a sense of belonging.”\n\nFormatting Guidance:\n- Use a standard argumentative format: double-spaced, readable font, clear paragraph breaks, and consistent heading style if required by your teacher.\n- If citing sources, include in-text citations and a works cited page (MLA is common for high school).\n- Keep paragraphs focused: one main idea per paragraph with a strong topic sentence and concluding link back to the thesis.\n\nStronger thesis options (choose one or adapt):\n- “Public schools should require uniforms because standardizing dress reduces status competition, removes appearance-based targets for bullying, and builds a culture of belonging.”\n- “To make campuses safer, schools should require uniforms; by removing visible status markers, uniforms cut the fuel for bullying and refocus attention on learning.”\n- “Schools should adopt uniforms to reduce bullying: when clothing is standardized, students have fewer reasons to judge, isolate, or harass peers over appearance or brand.”\n\nSample introduction paragraph (ready to use or adapt):\n- “No student should dread walking into school because of what they wear. Bullying often targets appearance—brands, styles, and price tags become excuses to judge and exclude. Schools should require uniforms because standardizing dress reduces status competition and appearance-based bullying. By removing visible markers that separate students into ‘haves’ and ‘have-nots,’ uniforms help create a more respectful environment where attention can return to learning.”\n\nSample topic sentences and transitions:\n- Body 1: “First, uniforms reduce status competition by eliminating the brand and style differences that often trigger teasing.”\n- Body 2: “Moreover, schools that adopt uniform policies report fewer appearance-based conflicts, suggesting uniforms help curb bullying.”\n- Body 3 (counterargument): “Critics argue that uniforms limit self-expression and can be costly; however, schools can allow personal accessories and provide assistance programs, maintaining safety without sacrificing equity.”\n- Conclusion: “Ultimately, by removing appearance-based targets and promoting belonging, uniforms are a practical step schools can take to reduce bullying.”\n\nWould you like me to rewrite your thesis, introduction, and an outline for the full essay based on your assignment length and requirements? If you share any rubric details or source expectations, I can tailor the draft and provide transitions throughout."

      "groundtruth": "Thanks for sharing your goals and the draft. I can help refine the tone for professional readers and give comprehensive, line-by-line edits.\n\nA couple of quick questions to tailor the rewrite:\n- What is the name of your company and the main services you offer (e.g., consulting, design, software development)?\n- Do you prefer a formal business letter or a concise business email? Your draft mentions “email,” but your goal says “business letter.\n- What action do you want the recipient to take (schedule a call, request a proposal, reply with questions)?\n- Do you have a specific recipient name or title to address?\n\nOverview of editorial guidance I’ll provide\n- Modernize the salutation and make it more personal and professional.\n- Fix grammar and punctuation issues (subject–verb agreement, comma splices, plural nouns).\n- Align pronouns and tone (consistent “we” vs. “I”).\n- Strengthen clarity and add a specific call to action.\n- Tailor wording for either a formal letter or a concise email format.\n\nCategorized feedback\n\nOverall Feedback\n- The tone is polite but generic. Professional readers prefer clear value statements and a specific next step.\n- Replace outdated or impersonal salutations (“Dear Sir or Madam”) with a name or role-based greeting.\n- Remove or shorten cliché openers (“I hope this email finds you well”) to keep the message concise and professional.\n- Make the call to action specific (e.g., propose a time for a call or invite them to request a proposal).\n\nSpelling Edits\n- “Please let me know if you have any question.” → “Please let me know if you have any questions.”\n  Reason: “Questions” should be plural when referring to any number of potential questions.\n\nGrammar Edits\n- “We offer services that is tailored to your needs” → “We offer services that are tailored to your needs”\n  Reason: Subject–verb agreement. “Services” is plural, so use “are.”\n- “...and we want to ensure your satisfaction, we will be happy to help.” → Split into two sentences or use a coordinating conjunction.\n  Reason: Comma splice. Two independent clauses joined by a comma should be separated by a period, semicolon, or conjunction.\n- Pronoun consistency: You switch from “we” to “me” in the last sentence.\n  Suggestion: Use “we” throughout if writing on behalf of the company, or “I” if writing as a representative.\n\nStructural Suggestions\n- Use a clear, direct opener that states your value: what you do and why it matters to the client.\n- Follow with a brief assurance or benefit (commitment to satisfaction).\n- End with a specific call to action (propose a meeting, invite a reply, provide contact details).\n- If this is a letter, include a professional sign-off and full contact details. If it’s an email, add a relevant subject line and keep paragraphs short.\n\nOpportunities for Improvement\n- Add one sentence describing the specific services or outcomes (e.g., “We help [type of client] achieve [result] through [service].”).\n- Include a brief credibility element (e.g., years in business, notable clients, or a quick metric).\n- Offer a concrete next step with a suggested time (e.g., “Could we schedule a 15-minute call next week?”).\n- Personalize the greeting with the recipient’s name or role.\n\nFormatting Guidance\n- Business letter:\n  - Your Name, Title, Company, Address, Phone, Email\n  - Date\n  - Recipient Name, Title, Company, Address\n  - Salutation\n  - 2–3 short paragraphs (value, benefit, CTA)\n  - Professional closing (Sincerely/Best regards) + signature block\n- Business email:\n  - Subject line (clear benefit, concise)\n  - Greeting with name\n  - 2 short paragraphs (value + CTA)\n  - Signature with full contact info\n\nLine-by-line edits with reasoning\n\nOriginal: “Dear Sir or Madam,”\n- Edit: “Dear [Recipient’s Name],” or “Dear [Title/Team],”\n- Reason: “Dear Sir or Madam” is dated and impersonal. Using a name or role feels more professional and client-focused.\n\nOriginal: “I hope this email finds you well.”\n- Edit options:\n  - Remove entirely for concision.\n  - Or: “I hope you’re well.”\n- Reason: This phrase is common but can feel generic. Many professional readers prefer getting to the point.\n\nOriginal: “We offer services that is tailored to your needs, and we want to ensure your satisfaction, we will be happy to help.”\n- Edit: “Our services are tailored to your needs, and we are committed to your satisfaction. We would be happy to discuss how we can support your goals.”\n- Reason: Fix subject–verb agreement; eliminate comma splice; strengthen tone by clarifying benefits and using parallel structure.\n\nOriginal: “Please let me know if you have any question.”\n- Edit: “Please let us know a convenient time to talk, or reply with any questions.”\n- Reason: Pluralize “questions,” make the CTA specific, and keep pronouns consistent.\n\nWould you like me to generate the edited text?\nBelow are two polished versions you can use immediately. I’ll tailor them further once you confirm whether this is a letter or email and share your service details.\n\nOption A – Formal business letter\nDear [Recipient Name],\n\nOur services are tailored to your needs, and we are committed to your satisfaction. We would welcome the opportunity to discuss how we can support your goals.\n\nPlease let us know a convenient time to connect, or contact me directly at [phone] or [email]. I look forward to speaking with you.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]\n[Title]\n[Company]\n[Phone] | [Email] | [Website]\n\nOption B – Concise business email\nSubject: Tailored services to support [Client Company]’s goals\n\nDear [Recipient Name],\n\nWe provide services tailored to your needs and are committed to your satisfaction. I’d be happy to share a brief overview and explore how we can help.\n\nCould we schedule a 15-minute call next week? Please reply with a time that works for you, or reach me at [phone/email].\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]\n[Title], [Company]\n[Phone] | [Email] | [Website]\n\nWould you like me to incorporate your company name, services, and a specific CTA into one final version? I can also adjust the tone to be more formal or more conversational, depending on your preference."

      "groundtruth": "Thanks for sharing your goals and audience. I help edit writing line by line and give clear, constructive feedback on tone, clarity, grammar, structure, and formatting. Before we dive in, two quick questions to tailor the feedback:\n- What is your central message in one sentence (for example: “Curiosity drives me to explore biology through hands-on problem solving”)?\n- Which specific anecdotes are you considering (e.g., a lab project, fieldwork, a challenge you overcame)? And what word count are you targeting?\n\nOverview of the approach\n- I’ll give precise line-by-line edits of the text you shared, with reasoning.\n- I’ll then provide categorized feedback on tone, concision, authenticity, and structure tailored to a college admissions audience.\n- I’ll suggest how to link anecdotes to your central message and keep the tone confident yet humble.\n- If you want, I can draft a revised opening or the full personal statement after we discuss your anecdotes.\n\nLine-by-line edits with reasoning\n1) Original: “Growing up in a small town taught me resilience and curiosity.”\n   - Edited: “Growing up in a small town shaped my resilience and curiosity.”\n   - Reasoning: “Shaped” is more concise and feels less cliché than “taught me,” while still showing growth. Consider replacing abstract traits (“resilience,” “curiosity”) with a concrete detail later (e.g., a specific moment or habit) to convey authenticity.\n\n2) Original: “I want to show my passion for biology without sounding arrogant.”\n   - Edited: “I aim to convey my passion for biology with humility.”\n   - Reasoning: Positive framing (“convey … with humility”) is concise and avoids the meta “show” language. In the essay itself, don’t state this intent—demonstrate it through choices, actions, and reflective insight.\n\n3) Original: “I’m not sure if my anecdotes connect to my central message or if the tone fits my audience.”\n   - Edited: “I’m working to ensure my anecdotes reinforce a clear central message and suit a college admissions audience.”\n   - Reasoning: More assertive and concise (“working to ensure” + “reinforce a clear central message”). In the essay, replace uncertainty with clear transitions and reflective sentences that explicitly tie each anecdote to your message.\n\nOverall Feedback\n- Authenticity: Avoid general claims (“resilience,” “curiosity”) unless you ground them in vivid, specific moments. Specifics make you memorable and humble.\n- Concision: Replace meta statements (what you want to show) with actions and reflection. Trim filler (“I want to,” “I’m not sure if”) and use strong verbs.\n- Tone for admissions: Confident, reflective, and collaborative. Show impact on others or learning from setbacks. Avoid grandiose language and excessive self-praise.\n- Connection: After each anecdote, include a 1–2 sentence reflection that ties it back to your central message and forward to your future goals in biology.\n\nSpelling Edits\n- No spelling errors in the lines you shared.\n- Note: “college admissions committee” is your audience; if you reference them, use “college admissions readers” or “the admissions committee” for clarity and consistency.\n\nGrammar Edits\n- Strengthen verb choice: “shaped” or “cultivated” instead of “taught me” for a smoother, less didactic tone.\n- Avoid meta phrasing: Instead of “I want to show,” demonstrate through a specific example and reflective insight.\n- Parallel structure: When you list two aims (“connect to my central message” and “fit my audience”), make them parallel—e.g., “reinforce a clear central message and suit a college admissions audience.”\n\nStructural Suggestions\n- Suggested outline for a concise, authentic personal statement (650 words max):\n  1) Hook: A specific moment that reveals curiosity or resilience (one vivid image or action).\n  2) Pivot: Brief context—small-town background—without clichés; tie the moment to your values.\n  3) Biology Focus: One or two concrete experiences (experiment, project, fieldwork). Use sensory or technical details sparingly to show competence.\n  4) Reflection: What you learned (intellectual growth, ethics, collaboration, humility). This is where you keep tone grounded and avoid arrogance.\n  5) Impact and Future: How these experiences shape what you hope to explore in college biology (not name-dropping programs yet, just direction).\n  6) Closing: Return to the opening image or idea, showing continuity and purpose.\n\n- How to connect anecdotes:\n  - After each anecdote, add a reflection sentence starting with “This taught me…” or “I realized…” then end with a forward-looking line: “Because of this, I now…” This explicitly ties the story to the central message and your trajectory.\n\nOpportunities for Improvement\n- Replace abstractions with specifics: One concrete detail (equipment used, problem solved, a question you asked) communicates more than labels.\n- Show humility through process: Include a small failure or misconception you corrected. Admissions readers value teachability.\n- Use active verbs: “analyzed,” “cultured,” “designed,” “mentored,” “iterated” instead of passive phrasing.\n- Limit themes: Focus on 1–2 core ideas (e.g., curiosity + collaborative problem-solving). Too many themes dilute impact.\n- Audience fit: Emphasize learning, ethics, and collaboration over prestige or competition.\n\nFormatting Guidance\n- Common App essays: Plain text; paragraph breaks are preserved, but extra formatting (bold/italics) is not. Aim for 3–5 short paragraphs.\n- Keep line lengths readable; avoid long blocks of text. Use a clear, simple font when drafting (for your own readability).\n- No title needed unless it genuinely adds meaning; you can start directly with the hook.\n- Avoid quotation-heavy openings; one brief, concrete sentence is stronger than a long setup.\n\nWould you like further assistance?\n- If you share your draft and the specific anecdotes, I can provide detailed line-by-line edits and tighten the prose while preserving your voice.\n- I can also draft a revised opening paragraph that balances authenticity and humility.\n\nOffer to generate edited text\n- If helpful, I can turn your three meta sentences into a concise thesis-style opening you could adapt:\n  - “Raised in a town where answers weren’t handed to me, I learned to ask better questions. That habit now shapes how I approach biology—curious, persistent, and grounded in what I can learn from mistakes.”\n- Or, send your full draft, and I’ll rewrite it incorporating all suggested changes."

      "groundtruth": "Thanks for sharing your text and goals. To confirm: you want spelling fixes and light tone polishing for a short cover letter snippet aimed at a hiring manager. Would you like me to keep the phrasing very close to your original, or are you open to small refinements for a more professional tone? Also, if you have the company and role name, I can tailor the wording slightly.\n\nOverview of what I’ll do\n- Correct all spelling errors and tidy any small grammar issues that affect clarity.\n- Lightly polish the tone to sound professional and confident without sounding overly casual or demanding.\n- Provide line-by-line notes so you can see exactly what changed and why.\n- Offer a clean, edited version you can drop into your cover letter.\n\nOverall Feedback\n- Your message is concise and clear.

      "groundtruth": "Thanks for sharing your text. I can help with grammar-focused, line-by-line edits for your reflective essay aimed at a teacher. Before we begin, do you prefer US or UK English? (For example, in US English “team” is usually singular—“the team was”—while UK English often uses plural—“the team were.”) Also, would you like minimal edits only, or a slightly polished rewrite for clarity?\n\nOverview of what I’ll do\n- Focus on grammar, tense consistency, subject–verb agreement, modifiers, and punctuation.\n- Keep your reflective tone and make phrasing clear and idiomatic for a teacher audience.\n- Provide line-by-line edits with reasons, then offer a clean revised version if you want it.\n\nOverall Feedback\n- Your ideas are clear and sequential: you present a result, describe work and effort, and end with team celebration.\n- The main grammar issues are subject–verb agreement, inconsistent tense, a dangling modifier, and a comma splice.\n- A few phrases can be made more idiomatic and precise (e.g., “successful in the project” → “successful on the project” or “successful in completing the project”).\n\nSpelling Edits\n- No spelling errors detected.\n\nGrammar Edits (line-by-line with explanations)\n1) Original: “The results shows that I was successful in the project.”\n   - Edit: “The results show that I was successful on the project.”\n   - Why: “Results” is plural, so use “show,” not “shows.” “Successful on the project” is more idiomatic than “successful in the project.” Alternative: “The results show that I was successful in completing the project,” which is even clearer.\n\n2) Original: “I was working on the report and finish it yesterday.”\n   - Edit (simple past for consistency): “I worked on the report and finished it yesterday.”\n   - Why: Keep the same tense within the sentence. “Yesterday” calls for simple past. “Was working … finished” can work, but the mismatch (“was working” vs. “finish”) is incorrect; if you keep the progressive, make it “was working … and finished.”\n\n3) Original: “Running quickly, the finish line seemed far.”\n   - Edit: “While I was running quickly, the finish line seemed far away.”\n   - Why: The original has a dangling modifier—“Running quickly” needs to modify “I,” not “the finish line.” Adding “away” is the natural collocation with “far.”\n\n4) Original: “The team were excited, we celebrated and it was great.”\n   - US English edit: “The team was excited. We celebrated, and it was great.”\n   - UK English edit: “The team were excited. We celebrated, and it was great.”\n   - Why: Fix the comma splice by splitting into two sentences or using a semicolon. In US English, “team” is treated as singular (“was”); in UK English, plural (“were”). Keeping “it was great” is acceptable, though you could make it more specific (e.g., “and it felt great” or “and it was a rewarding moment”).\n\nStructural Suggestions\n- Consider linking the metaphor (“finish line”) more directly to the project for coherence: e.g., “Even though I was moving quickly to meet the deadline, the ‘finish line’ still felt far away.”\n- You can combine related ideas for smoother flow: for instance, connect success to the effort and celebration:\n  - “The results show that I was successful on the project. I worked on the report and finished it yesterday. While I was running quickly, the finish line still seemed far away, but in the end the team was excited. We celebrated, and it felt great.”\n\nOpportunities for Improvement\n- Replace vague phrasing like “it was great” with a more specific reflection (e.g., “It felt rewarding to see our hard work pay off”).\n- Clarify the timeline: if “running quickly” is a metaphor for working toward the deadline, say so explicitly.\n- Keep tense consistent throughout (past tense for completed actions).\n\nFormatting Guidance\n- For a reflective essay to a teacher, use first person consistently and past tense for completed events.\n- Aim for paragraph form with clear transitions (e.g., “First,” “Later,” “In the end”).\n- Avoid comma splices; join independent clauses with a period, semicolon, or a coordinating conjunction with a comma.\n\nWould you like me to produce a clean, edited version now? I can provide:\n- US English version\n- UK English version\n- Minimal changes vs. slightly more polished for clarity\n\nIf you confirm your preference, I’ll rewrite the paragraph accordingly."

      "groundtruth": "Thanks for sharing your text and goals. Since you’re writing an analytical essay for classmates and want comprehensive improvements, I’ll focus on making the tone more formal and precise, improving grammar and spelling, and strengthening structure and clarity. Before I finalize a rewrite, let me know if you have any constraints (word count, required citation style, rubric criteria) or a preferred tone (strictly formal vs. accessible academic).\n\nOverview of what I’ll do\n- Make the language more precise and formal for an analytical essay audience.\n- Fix spelling and grammar (subject–verb agreement, pluralization of “data,” tense consistency).\n- Improve transitions and cohesion, showing cause-and-effect clearly.\n- Suggest more specific claims and how to support them with evidence.\n- Offer a clean revised version you can use or adapt.\n\nLine-by-line edits with reasoning\n1) Original: “The experiment was sucssesful but kind of messy.”\n   - Spelling: Change “sucssesful” to “successful” for correct spelling.\n   - Diction/tone: Replace “kind of messy” (informal and vague) with “somewhat disorganized” or “methodologically inconsistent” for academic tone.\n   - Precision: Consider clarifying what “successful” means (met objective? produced usable results?).\n   - Suggested edit: “The experiment was successful, but aspects of the procedure were somewhat disorganized.”\n\n2) Original: “The data is inconsistent and we was recording at different times.”\n   - Grammar: Use plural verb with “data” in academic writing: “data are.”\n   - Grammar: Change “we was” to “we were.”\n   - Clarity/causality: Show cause-and-effect explicitly.\n   - Tense consistency: Use past tense for specific actions already completed.\n   - Suggested edit: “The data are inconsistent, likely because measurements were recorded at different times.”\n\n3) Original: “Also, I think the intro could be shorter.”\n   - Diction/tone: Replace “I think” with an assertive statement; replace “intro” with “introduction.”\n   - Concision: “Shorter” → “more concise” for academic tone.\n   - Suggested edit: “Additionally, the introduction could be more concise.”\n\n4) Original: “This study have many limitations.”\n   - Grammar: Change “have” to “has” (singular subject).\n   - Tone: “many” can sound imprecise or overly negative; “several” is more measured unless you plan to list them.\n   - Specificity: Consider previewing the main limitations (timing, sample size, instrumentation).\n   - Suggested edit: “This study has several limitations.”\n\n5) Original: “Overall, it's good.”\n   - Diction/tone: Avoid vague evaluation; specify what is good and where improvement is needed.\n   - Formality: Replace contraction “it’s” with “it is.”\n   - Suggested edit: “Overall, the results are promising, but improvements to methodology and presentation are needed.”\n\nOverall Feedback\n- Tone and precision: Shift from conversational phrasing (“kind of messy,” “intro,” “it’s good”) to formal, specific language suitable for an analytical essay.\n- Grammar and agreement: Align verbs correctly with subjects (“data are,” “we were,” “study has”) and keep tense consistent (past tense for what you did; present tense for general claims).\n- Clarity and causality: Explicitly link inconsistent data to its probable cause (recording at different times).\n- Specificity: Replace vague evaluations with concrete criteria (e.g., met objectives, reproducibility, measurement reliability).\n\nSpelling Edits\n- “sucssesful” → “successful”\n  Reason: Correct spelling; improves credibility and readability.\n\nGrammar Edits\n- “data is” → “data are”\n  Reason: In formal academic writing, “data” is treated as a plural noun.\n- “we was recording” → “we were recording” or “measurements were recorded”\n  Reason: Correct subject–verb agreement; passive voice can be appropriate when focusing on procedure.\n- “This study have” → “This study has”\n  Reason: Singular subject takes singular verb.\n- “it’s good” → “it is good”\n  Reason: Avoid contractions in formal writing.\n\nStructural Suggestions\n- Flow: Present a clear progression—outcome, issue, cause, implications, recommendation.\n- Example structure for this paragraph:\n  - Sentence 1: State the overall outcome (success) with a brief qualifier (organizational issues).\n  - Sentence 2: Identify the data problem.\n  - Sentence 3: Explain the likely cause (time of recording).\n  - Sentence 4: Note limitations more specifically or preview them.\n  - Sentence 5: Provide a balanced overall evaluation with actionable next steps.\n- If this is part of a Discussion section, follow with evidence (e.g., variability across time points, standard deviations) and propose corrective measures (standardized timing, protocol checklist).\n\nOpportunities for Improvement\n- Quantify inconsistency: Mention specific metrics (e.g., variation across trials, range, SD) to support the claim.\n- Specify limitations: List the key limitations (e.g., non-standardized timing, small sample size, instrument calibration) and explain their impact.\n- Actionable recommendations: Propose fixes (e.g., consistent recording schedule, pre-experiment checklist, inter-rater reliability).\n- Define “successful”: State the criteria (hypothesis supported, target metric achieved) so “successful” has clear meaning.\n\nFormatting Guidance\n- Use formal academic style: Avoid contractions and colloquialisms; use precise vocabulary.\n- Paragraphing: Ensure each paragraph has a clear topic sentence, evidence, and analysis.\n- Transitions: Use “Additionally,” “Moreover,” “Consequently,” “However,” to show relationships.\n- Tense: Past tense for specific procedures and results; present tense for interpretations that remain true.\n- If required, align citations with your class’s style (APA/MLA/Chicago) and include figure/table labels if you reference data.\n\nProposed revised version (concise and analytical)\n- “The experiment was successful, but aspects of the procedure were somewhat disorganized. The data are inconsistent, likely because measurements were recorded at different times. Additionally, the introduction could be more concise. This study has several limitations. Overall, the results are promising, but improvements to methodology and presentation are needed.”\n\nWould you like me to:\n- Expand this into a full paragraph with specific examples and recommendations?\n- Adjust the tone (more formal or more conversational for classmates)?\n- Integrate these edits into your full essay if you share more text?"

      "groundtruth": "Thanks for sharing your goals and text. To make your narrative essay consistent, I can standardize tense and tone, explain each change line by line, and suggest structural and formatting improvements.\n\nBefore I proceed, two quick questions to tailor the edit:\n- Tense preference: Would you like the whole piece in simple past (because the event happened “yesterday”) or in vivid present (present-tense storytelling)? I can do either, but simple past is most typical for this kind of narrative.\n- Tone preference: Would you like a neutral, semi-formal tone or a more casual, conversational tone? Given your audience (“general readers”), semi-formal/neutral is often best.\n\nOverview of editorial guidance:\n- Choose a single dominant tense (recommendation: simple past) and make all verbs align.\n- Unify tone by removing slang and using clear, neutral wording.\n- Smooth out sentence structure (replace the semicolon with a period, clarify pronouns like “it,” and maintain parallel verb forms).\n- Keep evaluation of your writing (comments about structure/style) in the same tense for consistency, unless you want a deliberate contrast.\n\nLine-by-line edits with reasons:\n1) Original: “Yesterday I walk to the beach and I am watching the waves; later I will wrote about it.”\n   Edit: “Yesterday, I walked to the beach and watched the waves. Later, I planned to write about the experience.”\n   Why:\n   - “walk” → “walked” and “am watching” → “watched” to align with simple past (“Yesterday” sets the timeline).\n   - Replace the semicolon with a period for clarity and flow.\n   - “will wrote” is ungrammatical; “planned to write” matches past time and reads smoothly.\n   - “it” is vague; “the experience” is clearer for readers.\n\n2) Original: “I'm gonna add more details because it felt awesome, but the structure is all over the place and I start with the ending.”\n   Edit: “I intended to add more details because it felt wonderful, but the structure was all over the place, and I started with the ending.”\n   Why:\n   - “I’m gonna” → “I intended to” to standardize tone (semi-formal) and tense (past).\n   - “awesome” → “wonderful” for a neutral tone suitable for general readers.\n   - “is” → “was” and “start” → “started” to maintain past tense.\n   - Add a comma before “and” to separate independent clauses and improve readability.\n\n3) Original: “The style switches between casual and formal.”\n   Edit: “The style shifted between casual and formal.”\n   Why:\n   - “switches” → “shifted” to keep past tense consistent.\n   - Keeps your point while aligning tone and tense with the rest.\n\nCategorized feedback:\n\nOverall Feedback:\n- The main issue is inconsistent tense (present, future, and past mixed) and shifting tone (slang vs. formal). Choosing simple past and a neutral, semi-formal voice will make the narrative clear and cohesive for general readers.\n- Clarify vague references (like “it”) and avoid unnecessary punctuation complexity for short, straightforward sentences.\n\nSpelling Edits:\n- “gonna” → “going to” (or, better here, “intended to”) because “gonna” is colloquial and not ideal for a general-audience essay.\n- No other spelling errors found.\n\nGrammar Edits:\n- Tense standardization: change “walk,” “am watching,” “will wrote,” “is,” “start,” “switches” to past forms (“walked,” “watched,” “planned to write,” “was,” “started,” “shifted”).\n- Verb form correction: “will wrote” is incorrect. Use “planned to write” or “would write” (future-in-the-past).\n- Punctuation: Replace the semicolon with a period for clarity; add a comma before “and” when joining independent clauses.\n\nStructural Suggestions:\n- If your essay “starts with the ending,” decide if that’s intentional (a hook) or accidental. If intentional, signal it clearly: for example, begin with a brief reflection and then transition to the chronological story.\n- Otherwise, consider chronological order: open with arriving at the beach, describe sensory details (sight, sound, feeling), then conclude with your plan to write about it and what you learned.\n- Clarify “the experience” rather than “it,” and add one or two concrete sensory images to anchor the narrative.\n\nOpportunities for Improvement:\n- Add specific details to elevate style: mention the color/texture of the waves, the wind, the scent of salt, or how the water’s rhythm affected your mood.\n- Replace general adjectives (“wonderful”) with precise ones that match your experience (“calming,” “invigorating,” “overwhelming”).\n- Consider a brief reflective sentence at the end tying the experience to why you wanted to write about it.\n\nFormatting Guidance:\n- Use short, clear paragraphs. For a brief narrative: 1) arrival and first impressions; 2) watching the waves; 3) reflection and writing intention.\n- Avoid excessive semicolons in simple narrative prose. Use periods and commas to keep rhythm steady.\n- Keep consistent voice throughout; if you include meta-remarks about your structure, keep them in the same tense as the narrative or set them off as a separate paragraph.\n\nWould you like me to apply these changes and generate a clean, edited version in:\n- Simple past, semi-formal tone; or\n- Present tense (for vivid immediacy), semi-formal tone?\n\nIf you prefer, I can provide both versions so you can choose."

      "groundtruth": "Quick questions so I tailor the edit:\n- Do you have a required word count or section headings for this research summary?\n- Are you using a specific citation style (APA, MLA, Chicago)?\n- Does your instructor require particular sections (e.g., Research Question, Background, Methods, Results, Conclusion), or is the structure flexible?\n\nOverview of my approach:\n- Because this is a research summary for an instructor, I’ll prioritize clarity, logical flow, and standard academic ordering: Research Question → Background → Methods → Results → Discussion/Conclusion.\n- I’ll give line-by-line edits to the three sentences you shared and explain the reasoning.\n- I’ll provide structural suggestions to eliminate duplication, fix section order, and improve transitions.\n- I’ll finish with formatting guidance typical for a short research summary and offer to rewrite the piece.\n\nOverall Feedback:\n- Main issue is section order: the research question should come before results, background should not follow the conclusion, and methods should precede results.\n- Remove duplication between background and conclusion; each section should have a distinct purpose (context vs. synthesis/implications).\n- Use consistent tense: past tense for methods and results, present tense for the research question and general claims.\n- Prefer clear signposting (topic sentences and headings) and avoid informal sequencing phrases like “then.”\n\nSpelling Edits:\n- No spelling errors in the three sentences. Minor style refinements suggested below (e.g., replace “then” with clearer signposting).\n\nGrammar Edits (line-by-line with reasoning):\n- Paragraph 1 original: “The results section lists three key findings, then I introduce my research question.”\n  - Edit: “I first state the research question, followed by a results section that presents three key findings.”\n  - Reasoning:\n    - Places the research question first to reflect standard academic order.\n    - Replaces informal “then” with “followed by” for a more formal tone.\n    - Uses parallel structure (“first… followed by…”).\n\n- Paragraph 2 original: “Background information appears after the conclusion, and some duplicated points appear in both sections.”\n  - Edit: “Place background information before the methods and results, and consolidate overlapping points to avoid duplication between the background and conclusion.”\n  - Reasoning:\n    - Shifts from description of the problem to a directive fix (“Place… consolidate…”).\n    - Clarifies which sections should contain which content.\n    - Improves precision (“overlapping points” rather than “duplicated points”).\n\n- Paragraph 3 original: “Methods are briefly mentioned at the end, although they should be earlier.”\n  - Edit: “Describe the methods immediately after the research question and before the results, providing enough detail to support the findings.”\n  - Reasoning:\n    - Specifies the correct placement and purpose.\n    - Uses active voice (“Describe”) and clarifies the level of detail needed.\n\nStructural Suggestions:\n- Recommended section order for a clear, instructor-friendly research summary:\n  1. Title (clear and specific).\n  2. Research Question or Objective (1–2 sentences in present tense).\n  3. Background/Context (brief overview of why the question matters; define key terms; 1 short paragraph).\n  4. Methods (study design, sample/data, measures, procedure; past tense; 1 short paragraph).\n  5. Results (three key findings; past tense; use numbered or clearly separated sentences).\n  6. Discussion/Conclusion (interpretation, implications, limitations; present tense for general claims; 1 short paragraph).\n- Move the research question to the beginning and make it the anchor for the summary.\n- Position methods immediately before results; this gives readers the basis to trust the findings.\n- Eliminate duplication:\n  - Keep context (definitions, prior work, rationale) strictly in Background.\n  - Keep synthesis (what the findings mean, limitations, future work) strictly in Discussion/Conclusion.\n- Use topic sentences to signpost each section:\n  - Background: “This study addresses… because…”\n  - Methods: “We employed… to examine…”\n  - Results: “We found three key results: (1)… (2)… (3)…”\n  - Conclusion: “These findings suggest…”\n- If space is limited, merge Background and Methods into a single, concise paragraph, but keep the Results and Conclusion separate.\n\nOpportunities for Improvement:\n- Strengthen topic sentences to clearly signal the purpose of each section.\n- Add brief methodological specifics (sample size, data source, analytic approach) to bolster credibility.\n- Use transition phrases to guide flow (e.g., “To investigate this question, we…”, “Our analysis shows…”).\n- Quantify findings where possible (percentages, effect sizes, counts) to make results concrete.\n- End with a clear takeaway sentence in the Conclusion that ties back to the research question.\n\nFormatting Guidance:\n- Use clear headings: Research Question, Background, Methods, Results, Conclusion.\n- Keep paragraphs short (3–5 sentences each) and focused on a single purpose.\n- If citing sources in Background, use the instructor’s required style (APA: author, year).\n- Consider numbering the three key findings in the Results for readability.\n- Maintain consistent tense: present for question and general claims; past for methods/results.\n\nWould you like me to apply these changes and generate a reorganized, edited version of your summary? If so, please share the full text (or confirm any required length and citation style), and I’ll rewrite it accordingly."

      "groundtruth": "Thanks for sharing your goals and audience. I can help you strengthen persuasiveness, add examples and statistics, improve transitions, and keep a consistent tone for a local newspaper op‑ed.\n\nA couple quick questions to tailor the advice:\n- What city or region is this for?\n- Approximate word count (typical local op-eds are 600–800 words)?\n- Any specific benefits you want to emphasize (economic, health, safety, environment, youth, small businesses)?\n- Are you comfortable referencing local data (city budget, park acreage, heat islands, property values), or would you prefer national sources?\n\nOverview of the editorial guidance I’ll offer\n- Clarify and strengthen your thesis so it’s specific and measurable.\n- Build a persuasive evidence mix (examples, statistics, comparisons, brief expert references).\n- Create a clear structure (hook, thesis, 3–4 benefit sections, counterargument, call to action).\n- Smooth transitions between paragraphs and maintain a consistent, civic-minded tone.\n- Tailor content to local newspaper readers (short paragraphs, concrete local details, practical funding ideas).\n\nOverall Feedback\n- Strengthen specificity: Replace the general claim (“invest in parks”) with a concrete proposal (e.g., “expand, maintain, and connect neighborhood parks within a 10-minute walk of every household”).\n- Balance appeals: Use logos (data), pathos (human stories), and ethos (credible sources or community leaders).\n- Add local relevance: Name neighborhoods, recent heat waves, flood events, or underused sites to make benefits tangible.\n- Include a brief counterargument and rebuttal to build credibility (cost concerns, maintenance, competing priorities).\n- End with a clear call to action (what readers and the city should do next).\n\nSpelling Edits\n- “don’t” → “do not” (for a more formal op‑ed tone).\n- Replace meta phrasing like “I don’t provide examples, statistics, or comparisons” with content itself; avoid self-referential remarks in published pieces.\n\nReasoning: Local op‑eds read more credibly with standard formal diction and without meta commentary.\n\nGrammar Edits\n- Avoid first person when stating shortcomings: Instead of “I don’t provide examples,” write with active, evidence-backed statements (“For example, small businesses near parks see increased foot traffic during events.”).\n- Maintain tense consistency: Use present tense for general truths (“Parks improve public health”) and past tense when citing specific past events (“Last summer’s heat wave sent emergency visits up…”).\n- Prefer active voice: “Parks reduce urban heat” rather than “Urban heat is reduced by parks.”\n\nReasoning: Active, consistent sentences increase clarity and persuasiveness for newspaper readers.\n\nStructural Suggestions\n- Suggested outline:\n  1) Hook: A vivid local scene or short anecdote (a crowded playground on a cool evening, a shaded path during a heat wave).\n  2) Thesis: Clear, specific proposal (what kind of investment, why now).\n  3) Economic benefits: Property values, small-business foot traffic, event-driven spending; reference credible sources (e.g., Trust for Public Land, NRPA).\n  4) Health benefits: Physical activity, mental health, youth development; cite a local health department or CDC guidance.\n  5) Environmental/resilience benefits: Shade, urban heat island mitigation, stormwater management, tree canopy goals.\n  6) Community safety and cohesion: “Eyes on the park,” programming, partnerships with youth organizations.\n  7) Address the cost: Brief cost–benefit, funding mechanisms (grants, public–private partnerships, bond measures, impact fees).\n  8) Counterargument & rebuttal: Acknowledge maintenance concerns; propose solutions (dedicated maintenance budgets, volunteer days, adopt-a-park).\n  9) Call to action: What readers and officials should do (attend council meeting, support funding measure, volunteer).\n- Paragraphs: Keep to 2–4 sentences each; lead with a clear topic sentence, end with a sentence that bridges to the next section.\n\nReasoning: A predictable structure helps readers follow the argument and makes room for data without overwhelming them.\n\nOpportunities for Improvement\n- Add comparisons: Reference nearby cities with strong park systems; note their outcomes (e.g., higher ParkScore rankings, better heat resilience). Keep data accurate and sourced.\n- Use one short, human-centered vignette: A senior finding respite on a shaded bench; kids safely playing close to home; a weekend market energizing a pocket park.\n- Include at least two data points: For credibility, attribute inline (“according to the Trust for Public Land,” “city budget reports,” “CDC”).\n- Incorporate a local map or figure (if the paper allows): “Half our households live more than a 10‑minute walk from a park.”\n- Propose realistic funding: Grants (state environmental funds), corporate sponsorships for amenities, tree-planting programs, developer impact fees, modest bond measures.\n- Name partners: Parks department, local schools, youth sports leagues, health nonprofits, neighborhood associations.\n\nFormatting Guidance\n- Title/headline: Make it specific and benefit-driven (“Parks Are Smart Infrastructure—Our City Should Fund Them Now”).\n- Lede: 1–2 sentences, vivid and local.\n- Length: 600–800 words; short paragraphs; avoid footnotes. Cite sources in-text (“according to…”). No academic citation formats.\n- Tone: Civic-minded, solutions-oriented, respectful. Avoid jargon; define any necessary terms (e.g., “urban heat island”).\n- Transitions: Use bridge phrases between sections:\n  - “Beyond the economic gains, parks improve public health.”\n  - “Equally important is resilience.”\n  - “Critics worry about costs; however…”\n  - “Ultimately, investment is both prudent and overdue.”\n- Ending: A concrete action (vote, email council, attend hearing) and a timeframe.\n\nWould you like further assistance?\n- If you share your city and preferred word count, I can draft a full op‑ed incorporating local context, transitional sentences, data placeholders, and a consistent tone.\n- I can also provide a paragraph-by-paragraph template you can fill with local facts.\n\nOffer to generate the edited text\n- I can rewrite your piece now. Please confirm:\n  - City/region\n  - Word count target\n  - Any must-include benefits or local examples\n  - Your preferred tone on a spectrum: assertive, balanced, or conciliatory\n  - Whether you want me to insert source attributions (e.g., “according to the Trust for Public Land”) and leave data as placeholders for you to verify."

      "groundtruth": "Thanks for sharing your persuasive essay. Before I dive in, a couple of quick questions so I can tailor the feedback:\n- Who is your target audience (teacher, classmates, school board, principal)?\n- Do you have a word-count requirement or a rubric (e.g., thesis, evidence, counterargument)?\n- Do you need to include any sources or data?\n\nOverview of how I’ll help:\n- I’ll provide line-by-line edits that correct grammar and clarify meaning while keeping your voice.\n- I’ll explain each change and why it improves the sentence.\n- I’ll give structural suggestions to turn this into a persuasive essay with a strong thesis, supporting points, and a call to action.\n- I’ll offer formatting guidance and, if you want, write a revised version that incorporates all improvements.\n\nLine-by-line edits with explanations:\n1) Original: “School lunches is healthy but they taste bad and students is complaining.”\n   Edited: “School lunches are healthy, but they often taste bad, and many students are complaining.”\n   Why:\n   - Subject–verb agreement: “lunches” is plural, so use “are,” not “is.”\n   - Add “often” to avoid an absolute claim and sound more reasonable.\n   - Add “many” to avoid overgeneralization and be more precise.\n   - Commas: place a comma after the introductory clause to improve readability (“are healthy, but…”).\n   - Parallel clarity: “students are complaining” matches the plural subject and reads smoothly.\n   Optional stronger wording for a more academic tone: “School lunches are intended to be healthy, but they are often unappetizing, and many students complain.”\n\n2) Original: “I think the policy should change though I don't know how.”\n   Edited (basic correction): “I think the policy should change, though I’m not sure how.”\n   Why:\n   - Comma before “though” to separate clauses.\n   - Contraction “I’m” improves flow; “not sure” is more natural than “don’t know.”\n   Stronger persuasive alternative (recommended): “The district should revise the lunch policy to balance nutrition with taste and increase student satisfaction.”\n   Why:\n   - Replaces uncertainty with a clear thesis claim (better for persuasion).\n   - Specifies the goal (balance nutrition and taste, increase satisfaction).\n\nOverall feedback:\n- Your central idea is clear: lunches may be healthy but taste poor, and that causes complaints. For persuasion, turn this into a firm thesis and propose concrete solutions.\n- Avoid uncertainty (“I don’t know how”); instead, present actionable recommendations.\n- Strengthen tone by using precise, academic vocabulary (e.g., “unappetizing,” “revise the policy,” “increase participation,” “reduce waste”).\n\nSpelling edits:\n- No spelling errors present.\n- Style note: “taste bad” is acceptable because “taste” is a linking verb and takes an adjective (“bad”). If you want a more formal tone, consider “taste poor” or “are unappetizing.”\n\nGrammar edits:\n- Subject–verb agreement: “School lunches is” → “School lunches are.”\n- Subject–verb agreement: “students is complaining” → “students are complaining.”\n- Comma usage: Add a comma before “but” and before “though” to correctly join independent clauses.\n- Precision: Add modifiers like “often” or “many” to avoid absolute generalizations.\n\nStructural suggestions:\n- Use a clear five-part structure:\n  1) Introduction: Hook (e.g., a short observation about students throwing away food), context (health goals), and thesis (policy should balance nutrition and taste).\n  2) Body paragraph 1: Why taste matters (participation rates, reduced waste, better energy and focus).\n  3) Body paragraph 2: Proposed solutions (student taste-tests, seasoning stations, more fresh options, culturally diverse menus, feedback surveys).\n  4) Body paragraph 3 (counterargument): Address constraints (USDA guidelines, budget) and show feasible ways to comply (work with a nutritionist, pilot recipes within guidelines, negotiate vendor pricing).\n  5) Conclusion: Call to action (ask the school board to run a pilot, create a student advisory committee, timeline).\n- Use topic sentences and transitions (“Furthermore,” “However,” “As a result,” “To address these concerns…”).\n\nOpportunities for improvement:\n- Add evidence: brief data (e.g., “In a recent student survey, 62% reported throwing away parts of their lunch”), observations, or quotes from peers.\n- Define success metrics: participation rates, food waste reduction, student satisfaction surveys.\n- Make recommendations concrete: “Introduce monthly taste-tests,” “Offer a seasoning bar (herbs, lemon, low-sodium options),” “Pilot three new recipes per quarter.”\n\nFormatting guidance:\n- If this is a standard high-school persuasive essay:\n  - Include a clear title (e.g., “Balancing Nutrition and Taste in School Lunches”).\n  - Use an introduction with a thesis at the end of the first paragraph.\n  - Double-space, 12-point Times New Roman, 1-inch margins.\n  - If citing sources or data, follow your class’s required style (MLA/APA) with in-text citations and a Works Cited/References page.\n- If it’s a letter to the school board, use a proper salutation, concise paragraphs, and a polite call to action.\n\nWould you like me to:\n- Expand this into a full persuasive paragraph or a 5-paragraph essay using the stronger thesis?\n- Incorporate specific evidence if you have any survey results or observations?\n\nIf helpful, here’s a concise revised version of your two sentences with a stronger persuasive tone:\n“School lunches are intended to be healthy, but they often taste unappetizing, and many students are complaining. The district should revise the lunch policy to balance nutrition with taste by piloting student-led menu testing, adding seasoning stations, and introducing more fresh, culturally diverse options within USDA guidelines.”"

      "groundtruth": "Overall Feedback\n- Your letter clearly expresses dissatisfaction, but it needs more professionalism, clarity, and specific details to be effective.\n- Key improvements:\n  - Use polite, firm language and avoid informal phrasing.\n  - Correct grammar and capitalization (e.g., “Manager,” “broken,” “does not”).\n  - Add essential details (order number, product name, date received) and a clear request with a timeframe.\n  - Break the message into short, clear paragraphs: greeting, issue summary, requested resolution, closing and contact info.\n- Quick questions to tailor the edit:\n  - What tone do you prefer (formal, firm, or neutral)?\n  - Do you want a refund, replacement, or store credit?\n  - Do you have an order number, purchase date, and photos of the damage to include?\n\nSpelling Edits\n- “broke” → “broken”\n  - Reason: “Broken” is the correct adjective form to describe the condition of the product.\n- No other spelling errors detected in the provided text.\n\nGrammar Edits\n- Capitalization and salutation: “Dear manager,” → “Dear Manager,” or “Dear Customer Service Manager,”\n  - Reason: Capitalize job titles in salutations; include a comma after the salutation.\n- Sentence correction: “The product arrived broke.” → “The product arrived broken.”\n  - Reason: Use the adjective “broken” after “arrived.”\n- Subject–verb agreement: “it do not work” → “it does not work.”\n  - Reason: “It” requires “does” in the present tense; “does not work” correctly shows the ongoing issue.\n- Run-on sentence and punctuation: “I am very upset and it do not work, please refund.” → “I am very upset, and the item does not work. Please issue a refund.”\n  - Reason: Split into two sentences to avoid a run-on; add “the item” for clarity; use a more professional request (“Please issue a refund.”).\n\nStructural Suggestions\n- Use a clear business-letter or email structure:\n  - Salutation: “Dear Customer Service Manager,”\n  - Opening sentence: State the product, order number, and date of arrival.\n  - Body: Briefly describe the damage and non-functionality; mention any troubleshooting done; offer photos.\n  - Resolution request: Specify refund (or replacement), desired timeframe, and preferred method (original payment method).\n  - Closing: Thank them for their attention; provide your full name and contact details.\n- Include key specifics:\n  - Product name/model\n  - Order number and purchase date\n  - Date and condition on arrival\n  - Any policy references (return window/warranty), if known\n- Keep it concise—3 short paragraphs is ideal.\n\nOpportunities for Improvement\n- Strengthen your request by adding a timeframe: e.g., “Please process a full refund within 7 business days.”\n- Offer cooperation: e.g., “I can provide photos of the damage and return the item.”\n- Maintain a firm yet polite tone: avoid emotional language (“very upset”) or balance it with facts and a professional request.\n- Clarify desired outcome: “full refund to the original payment method” or “replacement shipped at no cost.”\n\nFormatting Guidance\n- If sending as an email:\n  - Use a clear subject line: “Request for Refund – Order #12345 – Damaged Item on Arrival”\n  - Start with a proper salutation, use short paragraphs, and include contact info in your signature.\n- If sending as a letter:\n  - Include your address and date at the top, followed by the company’s address, then the salutation.\n  - Use standard margins and a readable font (11–12 pt).\n- Attach supporting evidence (photos, receipt) and reference attachments in the body.\n\nWould you like me to rewrite the letter now, incorporating these changes? If so, please share your order number, product name, purchase/arrival dates, preferred resolution (refund or replacement), and your contact details."

      "groundtruth": "Thanks for sharing your draft and goals. Before I dive in, a couple quick questions so I can tailor the edits:\n- About how long do you want the speech to be (e.g., 1–2 minutes, 3–5 minutes)?\n- What tone are you aiming for: collaborative and solution-focused, or more urgent and assertive?\n- Do you want to propose any specific actions (e.g., homework guidelines, no-homework nights, coordination across departments)?\n\nOverview of the editorial guidance I’ll provide\n- Make the statement clear, respectful, and persuasive for teachers and a principal.\n- Fix grammar and sentence structure (comma splice, subject–verb agreement).\n- Strengthen word choice to avoid overly negative phrasing (“complaining”) and emphasize shared goals.\n- Offer a simple outline and concrete, audience-aware proposals you could include.\n\nOverall Feedback\n- Audience alignment: Since you’re persuading teachers and the principal, use collaborative language that recognizes their professional expertise and shared commitment to student learning. Replace “complaining” with “expressing concerns” or “reporting challenges.”\n- Clarity and purpose: State your thesis succinctly: homework supports learning, but it should be balanced and purposeful. Then quickly define what “balance” means (e.g., reasonable limits, coordination, quality over quantity).\n- Solution-focused approach: Move beyond the problem to propose practical, actionable steps the committee can adopt. Emphasize benefits for teachers (better completion quality, fewer burnout-related issues, more meaningful class time).\n- Structure: Use a clear speech flow—acknowledge concerns, present evidence or observations, propose solutions, invite collaboration, and end with a respectful call to action.\n\nSpelling Edits\n- “we needs” → “we need”\n  - Explanation: Subject–verb agreement; “we” takes the base form “need.”\n\nGrammar Edits\n- Comma splice: “Students are complaining about too much homework, I argue…” joins two independent clauses with a comma.\n  - Fix with a conjunction or punctuation:\n    - “…too much homework, and I argue…”\n    - “…too much homework; I argue…”\n    - Or split into two sentences.\n- Word order and parallelism: “but also we needs balance” is awkward and ungrammatical.\n  - Smoother: “but we also need balance.”\n- Tone refinement (not grammar but important for audience): “complaining” can sound dismissive. Prefer “expressing concerns” or “reporting that the workload feels heavy.”\n\nStructural Suggestions\n- Suggested outline for a short persuasive speech:\n  1. Opening: Acknowledge shared goals (student learning, skill-building) and the role of homework.\n  2. Problem statement: Students are reporting that the volume/timing of homework can feel overwhelming, which impacts well-being and quality of learning.\n  3. Evidence/observations: Briefly reference observations, survey data, or examples (e.g., overlapping due dates across departments).\n  4. Proposal: Define “balance” and offer concrete steps (reasonable time estimates, coordination, purposeful assignments).\n  5. Benefits: Explain how these steps improve outcomes for students and teachers (better engagement, higher-quality work).\n  6. Call to action: Invite the committee to pilot guidelines or form a working group.\n- Keep paragraphs short and use transitions (“First,” “In addition,” “Therefore”) to guide listeners.\n\nOpportunities for Improvement\n- Define “necessary”: Specify why homework matters (practice, reinforcement, self-management).\n- Define “balance”: Offer specifics (e.g., weekly time caps by grade level, no-homework nights before major tests, coordination across departments to avoid stacking, focus on quality over quantity).\n- Include one brief anecdote or data point to humanize the issue.\n- Anticipate objections: Acknowledge that some practice is essential and propose flexible approaches (e.g., optional challenge problems, choice in assignments).\n- Use rhetorical strategies: Parallel structure (“Purposeful, proportional, and predictable”), a concise triad, and a clear call to action.\n\nFormatting Guidance\n- For a spoken draft:\n  - Use short sentences and line breaks where you want pauses.\n  - Add transitions to signpost your points.\n  - Emphasize key phrases by placing them at the end of sentences for impact.\n  - Aim for 1–3 minutes depending on meeting constraints; practice out loud to adjust pacing.\n\nLine-by-line edits of your sentence\n- Original: “Students are complaining about too much homework, I argue that homework is necessary but also we needs balance.”\n- Edited (basic fix, formal tone):\n  - “Many students are expressing concerns about the amount of homework, and I argue that homework is necessary, but we also need balance.”\n  - Reasoning: Replaces “complaining” with “expressing concerns” (respectful); fixes comma splice with “and”; adds a comma before “but” for readability; corrects “we needs” to “we need.”\n- Edited (more persuasive and audience-aware):\n  - “Many students have reported that the volume of homework can feel overwhelming. Homework is essential for learning, and we can strengthen its impact by ensuring a better balance.”\n  - Reasoning: Splits into two sentences to improve clarity; adds purpose (“essential for learning”); reframes “balance” as improving impact, which aligns with educator goals.\n- Edited (concise thesis statement):\n  - “Homework is essential, but it works best when it is purposeful, proportional, and coordinated.”\n  - Reasoning: Tight triad provides a clear, memorable standard.\n\nWould you like me to generate the edited speech?\n- I can expand this into a 1–2 minute speech tailored to your audience with specific proposals and a respectful call to action. If you share your preferred length and any policies you want to include (e.g., time caps, coordination guidelines), I’ll draft it now."

Choose one tense based on your context.\n- Incorrect past tense: “buyed”\n  - Corrected: “bought”\n  - Explanation: Irregular verbs don’t follow the “-ed” rule; “buy” becomes “bought” in the past.\n- Subject–verb agreement: “apples that is fresh”\n  - Corrected: “apples that are fresh”\n  - Streamlined alternative: “fresh apples”\n  - Explanation: “Apples” is plural, so use “are.” Often, turning the clause into an adjective (“fresh apples”) is clearer.\n- Comma usage and run-on structure: “I was going, then I go to the store, and buyed…”\n  - Corrected (past): “I went to the store and bought fresh apples.”\n  - Corrected (present): “I am going to the store to buy fresh apples.”\n  - Explanation: The original has comma splices and choppy coordination. Use one main clause with a coordinated verb phrase for a smooth sentence.\n\nStructural Suggestions:\n- Decide the timeline and simplify:\n  - Past tense (most natural for recounting): “I went to the store and bought fresh apples.”\n  - Present/progressive (planning or current action): “I am going to the store to buy fresh apples.”\n- If you meant intention rather than movement, use “going to” + verb:\n  - “I was going to go to the store and buy fresh apples,” or more concise, “I was going to buy fresh apples at the store.”\n\nOpportunities for Improvement:\n- Minimize redundancy: If you use “went,” you don’t need “then.”\n- Prefer precise vocabulary: “fresh apples” is cleaner than “apples that are fresh.”\n\nFormatting Guidance:\n- For a single-sentence update, keep it to one clear line in consistent tense.\n- If part of a larger paragraph, ensure surrounding sentences use the same tense unless there’s a clear reason to shift.\n\nWould you like me to:\n- Choose the best version based on your intended tense?\n- Expand the sentence with a bit more detail or style?\n\nIf you’d like, I can generate the edited sentence now.

Before I dive in, what are your goals for this opening—tone (playful, serious, poetic), target audience (children, YA, general), and any constraints (word count, vocabulary level)? Do you want a simple, direct opener or something more vivid?\n\nOverview of editorial guidance:\n- I’ll correct grammar (subject–verb agreement, article use, verb tense).\n- I’ll suggest clearer phrasing and stronger sentence structure.\n- I’ll offer two polished versions (one sentence and two sentences) you can choose from.\n\nOverall Feedback:\n- The idea is clear: a boy dreams of becoming an astronaut. To make it read smoothly, fix the grammar and consider splitting it into two sentences or using a semicolon for clarity.\n- Adjust article usage (“an” before “astronaut”), verb forms (“dreams,” “become”), and word order (“maybe” placement).\n- Consider specificity later (e.g., why he dreams, what sparks it), but for an opener, clarity is key.\n\nSpelling Edits:\n- astronaut: spelled correctly. No spelling errors in the current line.\n- became → become: not a spelling issue; this is a verb form/tense correction (see Grammar).\n\nGrammar Edits:\n- “who are dreams” → “who dreams”\n  - Issue type: Subject–verb agreement and unnecessary auxiliary.\n  - Rationale: “boy” is singular, so use “dreams.” The structure “who dreams” is correct; “are” is not needed.\n- “a astronaut” → “an astronaut”\n  - Issue type: Article usage.\n  - Rationale: Use “an” before words starting with a vowel sound.\n- “he maybe will became one someday” → “maybe he will become one someday” or “he may become one someday”\n  - Issue type: Word order, modality, and verb tense/form.\n  - Rationale: “Maybe” usually comes at the beginning of the clause or before the subject; “will become” (future) or “may become” (possibility) are correct. “Became” is past tense and doesn’t fit with “will.”\n- Comma after “astronaut”:\n  - Issue type: Punctuation/structure.\n  - Rationale: A comma here creates a run-on feel. Better to split into two sentences or use a semicolon.\n\nStructural Suggestions:\n- Option 1 (two sentences for clarity): “My story begins with a boy who dreams of becoming an astronaut.

Before I dive in, could you tell me:\n- Who is the target audience (teacher, general reader, admissions committee, etc.)?\n- What tone you prefer (consistent formal or consistent conversational)?\n- Do you want everything in past tense, or is present tense acceptable when describing your writing?\n\nOverview of how I’ll help\n- I’ll standardize tense across sentences, fix dialect to standard academic English, and make the style consistent.\n- I’ll clarify structure by correcting run-ons and improving parallel phrasing.\n- I’ll provide line-by-line edits plus categorized feedback and then offer a clean, rewritten version.\n\nLine-by-line edits with reasoning\n1) Original: “Yesterday I go to market and we be shopping.”\n   - Edited: “Yesterday I went to the market, and we shopped.”\n   - Reasoning:\n     - “go” → “went” to match past tense indicated by “Yesterday.”\n     - Add “the” before “market” for idiomatic standard English (“to the market”).\n     - “we be shopping” → “we shopped” to replace nonstandard dialect with standard past tense.\n     - Use a comma before “and” to join two independent clauses cleanly.\n\n2) Original: “The essay jump around, I write in casual slang, then formal.”\n   - Edited (formal, past tense for consistency): “The essay sometimes jumped around; I shifted between casual slang and a formal tone.”\n   - Reasoning:\n     - “jump” → “jumped” to keep past tense consistent.\n     - Replace comma splice with a semicolon to join two related independent clauses.\n     - Use parallel structure: “casual slang” and “a formal tone.”\n     - “then formal” → “a formal tone” for clarity and parallelism.\n\nCategorized feedback\n\nOverall Feedback\n- Your main issues are tense inconsistency (mixing present and past), nonstandard dialect (“we be shopping”), and structural problems (comma splice).\n- Decide on one tone (formal or conversational) and stick to it, and keep all verbs aligned with the timeline you set (“Yesterday” suggests past tense throughout).\n\nSpelling Edits\n- No spelling errors detected (“yesterday,” “market,” “essay” are spelled correctly).\n\nGrammar Edits\n- Past tense: “go” → “went”; “jump” → “jumped.”\n- Standard dialect: Replace “we be shopping” with “we shopped” or “we were shopping.”\n- Comma splice: “The essay jump around, I write…” should be separated with a semicolon, period, or conjunction.\n- Articles: Add “the” before “market” for idiomatic usage.\n\nStructural Suggestions\n- Use clear linking punctuation: a semicolon or a period instead of a comma when joining independent clauses.\n- Keep parallelism in lists or contrasts: “casual slang” and “a formal tone” match in structure.\n- Consider separating reflection about your writing from the narrative about yesterday to avoid confusing shifts.\n\nOpportunities for Improvement\n- Add specific details to make the scene more vivid: What did you buy? Why did you go?\n- If reflecting on style, explain the reason for switching tones (e.g., audience or purpose).\n- Consider transitions that connect ideas: for example, “Although the essay’s content was clear, its tone varied…”\n\nFormatting Guidance\n- For an essay, use complete sentences and consistent tense throughout each paragraph.\n- Avoid comma splices; use semicolons, periods, or coordinating conjunctions (and, but, so) correctly.\n- If you include self-reflection, place it in a separate sentence or paragraph to keep narrative flow clear.\n\nWould you like me to apply these edits to the whole piece and produce a polished version in your preferred tone?\n\nEdited version (formal, consistent past tense)\n- Yesterday I went to the market, and we shopped. The essay sometimes jumped around; I shifted between casual slang and a formal tone.\n\nIf you prefer a conversational tone instead, I can revise it to:\n- Yesterday I went to the market, and we did some shopping. My essay kind of jumped around; I switched between casual slang and a more formal voice.\n\nTell me your audience and tone preference, and I’ll tailor the final version accordingly."

      "groundtruth": "Structural Suggestions\n\n- Remove the section labels and merge into a single, concise paragraph.\n  - Concrete change: Delete “Intro:”, “Body:”, and “Conclusion:” and combine the sentences into one cohesive paragraph.\n  - Effect on coherence: Eliminating labels and merging the content creates a smooth flow from idea to support to conclusion, making the piece read like a unified thought rather than three disconnected parts.\n\n- Reorder to foreground the thesis and connect it directly to the evidence.\n  - Concrete change: Begin with a thesis that explains why you love science, then follow with the evidence (failures and successes), and end with a reflective conclusion.\n  - Proposed order:\n    1) “I love science because it teaches me through both failure and success.”\n    2) “My experiments sometimes fail, but I learn from them; other times they succeed, and that keeps me motivated.”\n    3) “That balance is why science is cool.”\n  - Effect on coherence: Starting with a clear reason (“because…”) ties the opening to the middle. The conclusion then echoes the thesis with a causal link, reducing repetition and making the logic explicit.\n\n- Trim redundant phrasing and replace the generic conclusion with a reflective echo of the main point.\n  - Concrete change: Replace “Science is cool.” with “That balance is why science is cool.” or “This is what makes science exciting to me.”\n  - Effect on coherence: The conclusion refers back to the body’s content, which strengthens unity and avoids a generic statement that doesn’t connect to the prior sentence.\n\n- Combine and vary sentences to improve flow and clarity.\n  - Concrete change: Merge the body idea into a compound sentence with a transition: “Although my experiments sometimes fail, others succeed, and both help me learn.”\n  - Effect on coherence: Using “although” and “and” signals contrast and connection, guiding the reader through your reasoning and making the paragraph feel purposeful rather than list-like.\n\n- Optional alternative structure (keep three sentences but add transitions and cause-effect):\n  - Concrete change:\n    1) “I love science.”\n    2) “Although my experiments sometimes fail, others succeed, and I learn from both.”\n    3) “That balance is what makes science exciting to me.”\n  - Effect on coherence: This preserves the original brevity while adding logical progression; each sentence leads naturally to the next.\n\nWould you like me to generate a polished version based on these suggestions? Here are two quick rewrites you can choose from:\n\n- Single-paragraph version: “I love science because it teaches me through both failure and success. My experiments sometimes fail, but I learn from them; other times they succeed, and that keeps me motivated. That balance is why science is cool.”\n\n- Three-sentence version: “I love science. Although my experiments sometimes fail, others succeed, and I learn from both. That balance is what makes science exciting to me.”\n\nIf you have a specific audience or assignment length, tell me and I can tailor the structure further."

      "groundtruth": "Thanks for sharing your focus. I can help you edit for grammar, style, structure, clarity, and evidence. Before we dive in, could you tell me:\n- What type of piece this is (school essay, article, speech, etc.) and the target audience?\n- Any length or format requirements (MLA/APA, word count)?\n- The tone you’re aiming for (neutral, persuasive, informative)?\n- Whether you’re allowed or required to include sources (e.g., IPCC, NASA, peer-reviewed journals)?\n\nOverview of how I’ll help\n- Clarify your thesis and main claims.\n- Strengthen evidence by adding credible data and examples.\n- Smooth transitions and paragraph structure to fix choppiness.\n- Adjust tone for credibility and coherence.\n- Correct grammar, spelling, and tense consistency.\n- Offer formatting tips and, if you want, rewrite the piece with all changes applied.\n\nBecause I don’t yet have your full text, I’ll give targeted guidance based on your summary and demonstrate with the line you provided. If you paste the full draft, I can give line-by-line edits across the whole piece.\n\nOverall Feedback\n- Your core claim (“climate change is real”) needs support from credible sources and specific data to be persuasive. Readers expect evidence, definitions, and clear reasoning.\n- Paragraphs should each focus on a single idea with a topic sentence, evidence, and analysis. Choppiness often comes from abrupt transitions, mixed ideas in one paragraph, or insufficient explanation between claims.\n- Maintain a clear, neutral, and evidence-driven tone. Avoid overly emotional language; prioritize accuracy, citations, and logic.\n\nSpelling Edits\n- “The argument say” should be “The argument says.” Reason: subject-verb agreement; “argument” (singular) takes “says.”\n- No spelling errors in the provided sentence, but watch for common climate-related terms:\n  - “greenhouse gases” (two words)\n  - “carbon dioxide” (not “carbon di-oxide”)\n  - “Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)” capitalization and acronym\n  - “peer-reviewed” hyphenation\n\nGrammar Edits\n- Original: “The argument say climate change is real but I don’t provide any data and the paragraphs is choppy.”\n  - Edit: “The argument says climate change is real, but I don’t provide any data, and the paragraphs are choppy.”\n  - Reasons:\n    - Subject-verb agreement: “argument says”\n    - Commas for compound sentence and clarity before “but” and to separate clauses\n    - Plural verb for “paragraphs are”\n    - Parallel structure: align verb forms (“is real,” “don’t provide,” “are choppy”)\n- Use consistent tense. In analytical essays, present tense is common (“Research shows…,” “This evidence indicates…”).\n- Prefer active voice for clarity: “The data show…” instead of “It is shown by data…”\n\nStructural Suggestions\n- Use a clear structure:\n  - Introduction: define climate change briefly, present your thesis (“Climate change is real because X, Y, and Z”), and preview main points.\n  - Body paragraph 1: Physical evidence (global temperature rise, ice melt). Include one or two specific data points.\n  - Body paragraph 2: Mechanism (greenhouse effect, CO2 trends). Explain cause-and-effect with sources.\n  - Body paragraph 3: Impacts (sea-level rise, extreme weather). Use recent examples and studies.\n  - Body paragraph 4 (optional): Address a counterargument (e.g., natural variability) and refute with evidence.\n  - Conclusion: restate thesis, synthesize insights, and end with implications or a call to informed understanding.\n- Within each paragraph:\n  - Topic sentence stating the claim.\n  - Evidence (data, studies) with citation.\n  - Analysis linking evidence to your claim (“This matters because…”).\n  - Concluding sentence that transitions to the next paragraph.\n- Add signpost transitions:\n  - Between paragraphs: “First,” “Additionally,” “In contrast,” “Moreover,” “Consequently.”\n  - Within paragraphs: “For example,” “Specifically,” “This suggests,” “As a result.”\n\nOpportunities for Improvement\n- Clarity: Define key terms (e.g., “climate change,” “greenhouse gases,” “anomaly”) the first time you use them. Avoid vague phrases like “scientists say” and specify sources.\n- Evidence: Incorporate reputable data (e.g., IPCC Assessment Reports, NASA GISS temperature records, NOAA sea-level trends, peer-reviewed studies). Include numbers with dates and units. Example: “Global mean surface temperature has increased by approximately 1.1°C since the late 19th century (IPCC, 2023).”\n- Examples: Use concrete, recent case studies to illustrate trends (e.g., “The 2023 Canadian wildfires released X megatonnes of CO2,” or “Arctic sea ice extent has declined by ~13% per decade since 1979.”).\n- Transitions: Bridge your ideas with signposting and summary sentences to avoid choppiness. End each paragraph by linking back to the thesis and foreshadowing the next point.\n- Tone: Aim for measured, objective language. Replace emotionally charged wording with precise, sourced statements. Acknowledge uncertainties where appropriate, and include a brief counterargument section to increase credibility.\n- Beyond error correction: Consider adding visual aids (if permitted), such as a graph of CO2 concentrations over time or a table of temperature anomalies, and discuss what they show. Integrate a brief methodology note (“This dataset is derived from…”). Strengthen synthesis by showing how multiple lines of evidence converge.\n\nFormatting Guidance\n- If this is a school essay:\n  - Use standard formatting (12 pt Times New Roman, double-spaced, 1-inch margins).\n  - Include a clear title and your name/date/class if required.\n  - Follow MLA or APA for in-text citations and a Works Cited/References page.\n  - Paragraph length: aim for 6–10 well-developed sentences per paragraph.\n- Citation examples:\n  - MLA: (IPCC 23)\n  - APA: (IPCC, 2023)\n- If images/charts are allowed, label them, cite sources, and reference them in the text (“As shown in Figure 1…”).\n\nSample line-by-line edit of your provided sentence\n- Original: The argument say climate change is real but I don’t provide any data and the paragraphs is choppy.\n- Edited: The argument says climate change is real, but I don’t provide any data, and the paragraphs are choppy.\n  - Reasoning:\n    - “say” → “says” for subject-verb agreement.\n    - Commas improve readability in a compound sentence.\n    - “paragraphs is” → “paragraphs are” for plural subject agreement.\n    - Balanced parallel structure across clauses.\n\nWould you like me to:\n- Review your full draft with line-by-line edits?\n- Create an outline and a thesis statement tailored to your assignment?\n- Rewrite your essay to incorporate evidence, examples, transitions, and a professional tone?\n\nIf you paste the text or share the document, I’ll provide detailed, itemized edits and a polished version."

      "groundtruth": "Thanks for sharing your goals and the excerpt. I can help strengthen your thesis, improve flow, and fix grammar/tense issues while keeping your voice and MLA expectations in mind.\n\nBefore I begin, a couple of quick clarifying questions:\n- Are you okay with removing phrases like “I think” to make the thesis more assertive, or do you prefer to keep first-person throughout?\n- Would you like to avoid contractions (e.g., “don’t” → “do not”) for a more formal tone?\n- Is “Turkle” referring to Sherry Turkle? If so, I’ll keep the in-text citation as-is and include a Works Cited placeholder.\n\nOverview of the editorial approach:\n- Strengthen the thesis into a clear, concise claim early in the paragraph.\n- Smooth transitions and tighten sentences for better flow.\n- Correct grammar (subject-verb agreement, pronouns, punctuation) and maintain consistent present tense where appropriate.\n- Align with MLA style: in-text citation placement, formal tone suggestions, and a Works Cited placeholder.\n\nLine-by-line edits with reasoning:\n1) Original: “In todays world, social media are making people more connected but also more apart.”\n   Suggested: “In today’s world, social media is making people more connected but also more isolated.”\n   Reasoning:\n   - “todays” needs an apostrophe: “today’s.”\n   - “social media” is usually treated as a singular mass noun: use “is,” not “are.”\n   - “more apart” is awkward; “more isolated” is clearer and more academic.\n\n2) Original: “I think that while it helps us communicate, it also make us lonely, because we are scrolling instead of seeing each other.”\n   Suggested: “While it helps us communicate, it also makes us lonely because we scroll instead of seeing each other.”\n   Reasoning:\n   - Remove “I think that” to strengthen the claim (thesis becomes more assertive).\n   - Subject-verb agreement: “makes,” not “make.”\n   - General statements in academic writing usually use simple present (“we scroll”), not present progressive (“we are scrolling”).\n   - The comma before “because” is unnecessary; removing it tightens the sentence.\n\n3) Original: “For example, I text my friends daily but I dont see them on weekend, which used to be normal before.”\n   Suggested: “For example, I text my friends daily, but I do not see them on weekends, even though hanging out used to be normal.”\n   Reasoning:\n   - Add comma before “but” to separate independent clauses.\n   - “dont” needs an apostrophe: “do not” (or “don’t,” but “do not” is more formal).\n   - “weekend” should be plural (“weekends”) to match the general habit.\n   - “which used to be normal before” is redundant and awkward; “used to be normal” is sufficient. “Hanging out” clarifies what was normal.\n\n4) Original: “This topic is very important because people are getting worse attention span and that affects school.”\n   Suggested: “This topic is important because people’s attention spans are getting worse, and that affects their performance in school.”\n   Reasoning:\n   - “attention span” should be plural (“attention spans”) or rephrased.\n   - “people are getting worse attention span” is awkward; rephrase for clarity.\n   - Specify “their performance in school” to make the impact clearer and more academic.\n   - Consider dropping “very” for a more formal tone.\n\n5) Original: “Some people says social media is just a tool and it depends how you use it, but I think the whole design is addictive. (Turkle 45)”\n   Suggested: “Some people say social media is just a tool and that it depends on how people use it, but its design is addictive (Turkle 45).”\n   Reasoning:\n   - Subject-verb agreement: “say,” not “says.”\n   - Add “that” for parallel structure and clarity.\n   - Avoid second-person “you” in academic writing; use “people.”\n   - In MLA, place the period after the parenthetical citation: “…addictive (Turkle 45).”\n\nOverall Feedback:\n- Your central idea is strong: social media both connects and isolates us. Tightening the thesis and removing hedging (“I think”) will make your argument more persuasive.\n- The flow improves when you use consistent present tense, avoid second-person “you,” and connect examples directly to your claim.\n- Word choice like “isolated,” “performance,” and “addictive design” strengthens academic tone without losing your voice.\n\nSpelling Edits:\n- “todays” → “today’s” (apostrophe shows possession).\n- “dont” → “do not” (or “don’t” if you prefer; “do not” is more formal).\n\nGrammar Edits:\n- Treat “social media” as singular: “social media is,” not “are.”\n- Subject-verb agreement: “makes,” not “make.”\n- Pluralize general habits: “on weekends,” not “on weekend.”\n- Comma usage: Add comma before “but” when joining independent clauses; remove comma before “because” unless needed for clarity.\n- Pronoun consistency: Avoid second-person “you” in academic writing; use “people” or “we.”\n- Place MLA citation before the period: “…addictive (Turkle 45).”\n\nStructural Suggestions:\n- Put a clear thesis early, ideally as the first or second sentence. For example: “Although social media helps us communicate, its addictive design makes us lonelier and weakens our attention, which harms our real-world relationships and school performance.”\n- Keep one example per paragraph and tie it back to the thesis explicitly (e.g., explain how weekend habits reflect isolation and attention issues).\n- Consider ending the paragraph with a sentence that previews the next point or reinforces your claim (a mini-conclusion).\n\nOpportunities for Improvement:\n- Add a brief transition from your example back to the broader impact (e.g., “This pattern shows how digital connection can replace in-person time.”).\n- If you’ll include more evidence later, think about varying examples (school focus, relationships, mental health) while staying within your assignment’s scope.\n- Consider a signal phrase for the source: “As Turkle argues, social media’s design encourages addictive behavior (45).” This integrates the citation smoothly.\n\nFormatting Guidance (MLA):\n- In-text citations: Place the parenthetical citation before the period: “…addictive (Turkle 45).”\n- Maintain double-spacing, 1-inch margins, Times New Roman 12 pt, and a running header with your last name and page number.\n- First page header: Your Name, Teacher’s Name, Course, Date (Day Month Year), then centered essay title, then your text.\n- Works Cited: Include a placeholder entry for Turkle. Example placeholder:\n  - Turkle, Sherry. [Title of Book]. [Publisher], [Year].\n  Replace brackets with the actual information when you finalize.\n\nWould you like me to produce a polished revision now, keeping your voice and the MLA citation? Here’s one possible edited version based on the suggestions:\n\nEdited paragraph (draft):\nIn today’s world, social media is making people more connected but also more isolated. While it helps us communicate, it also makes us lonely because we scroll instead of seeing each other. For example, I text my friends daily, but I do not see them on weekends, even though hanging out used to be normal. This topic is important because people’s attention spans are getting worse, and that affects their performance in school. Some people say social media is just a tool and that it depends on how people use it, but its design is addictive (Turkle 45).\n\nIf you want the thesis to be even more direct or prefer to keep contractions/first-person hedging, I can adjust. Do you want me to incorporate a stronger thesis sentence at the start, or keep the current tone?"

      "groundtruth": "Thanks for sharing your scene. I’ll keep your reflective, slightly whimsical voice and first-person perspective intact while focusing on tense consistency, clarity, dialogue punctuation, pacing, and show-vs.-tell. Before I dive in, two quick questions so I can tailor the edits:\n- Do you want the piece to read in past tense or present tense? Because you mention “last night,” past tense is the most consistent choice; I can also adjust the time marker if you prefer present tense immediacy.\n- Any word count or submission requirements from the magazine (font, margins, etc.), beyond standard manuscript format?\n\nOverview of what I’ll do:\n- Make all verbs consistent in one tense (recommend past tense to match “last night”).\n- Tighten descriptions for clarity while preserving your imagery and tone.\n- Correct dialogue punctuation and adjust sentence boundaries for rhythm and pacing.\n- Offer show-vs.-tell upgrades through small sensory details and interior beats.\n- Provide structural and formatting guidance for a clean submission.\n\nOverall Feedback\n- Your opening immediately establishes mood with “buzzing like a hive” and the quirky, secret-knowing whale—great voice. The main issues are tense shifts (present to past and back), a few unclear or repetitive verbs, and one long sentence that would land better if split. With consistent tense and a few rhythm tweaks, the scene will feel polished and vivid.\n\nSpelling Edits\n- No spelling errors detected.\n- Small word choice polish recommended:\n  - “empty place” → “empty arcade” for specificity and clarity.\n\nGrammar Edits (line-by-line with proposed revisions and reasoning)\n- Original: “I walk into the old arcade last night and the lights were buzzing like a hive.”\n  - Proposed: “I walked into the old arcade last night, and the lights buzzed like a hive.”\n  - Why: Aligns tense with “last night” (walk → walked; were buzzing → buzzed), improves flow with a comma to join independent clauses, and pares “were buzzing” to “buzzed” for tighter prose.\n\n- Original: “The air smells of dust and coins.”\n  - Proposed: “The air smelled of dust and coins.”\n  - Why: Past tense consistency (smells → smelled). “Of” is fine; the phrase is concise and evocative.\n\n- Original: “You coming?” Jay says, but I was already at the claw machine, staring at a plush whale that looks at me like it knows a secret.\n  - Proposed Option A (clean and concise): “You coming?” Jay said, but I was already at the claw machine, staring at a plush whale that looked at me like it knew a secret.\n  - Proposed Option B (stronger pacing): “You coming?” Jay said. I was already at the claw machine, staring at a plush whale that looked at me like it knew a secret.\n  - Why: Past tense consistency (says → said; looks → looked; knows → knew). Option B splits the long sentence, creating a clearer beat that shows your focus shifting from Jay to the whale.\n\n- Original: “I drop the token. It clatters.”\n  - Proposed: “I dropped the token. It clattered.”\n  - Why: Past tense consistency (drop → dropped; clatters → clattered). The short, paired sentences keep a nice staccato rhythm.\n\n- Original: “I am thinking this is silly and then the claw was moving and my heart thumped.”\n  - Proposed Option A: “I thought it was silly, and then the claw moved and my heart thumped.”\n  - Proposed Option B (smoother cause-effect): “I thought it was silly until the claw moved and my heart thumped.”\n  - Why: Past tense consistency (am thinking → thought; was moving → moved). Option B tightens the causal turn—your feeling changes when the claw moves.\n\n- Original: “The whale slips, then it slip again and I laugh, but it sounded too loud in the empty place.”\n  - Proposed Option A: “The whale slipped, then slipped again, and I laughed, but the sound was too loud in the empty arcade.”\n  - Proposed Option B (pacing with emphasis): “The whale slipped—then slipped again—and I laughed, but the sound was too loud in the empty arcade.”\n  - Why: Past tense consistency (slips/slip → slipped), parallel structure for “slipped,” and clarity (“empty place” → “empty arcade”). Option B uses em dashes to mimic the stuttering motion of the claw for vivid pacing.\n\nStructural Suggestions\n- Consider splitting the sentence with Jay’s dialogue from your action (Option B above) to emphasize your pull toward the whale and create a cleaner transition.\n- Use a brief interior beat after “It clattered” to show your anticipation or self-consciousness (e.g., “I pretended not to care, but my fingers hovered near the joystick”). This adds texture without changing plot beats.\n- The final sentence is carrying several actions; using em dashes or a period can distribute emphasis and make the scene feel more dynamic.\n\nOpportunities for Improvement (show vs. tell and pacing)\n- Show the arcade’s emptiness with a sensory detail: the soundtrack loop barely audible, a sticky spot under your shoe, or the flicker of a half-dead neon letter. This replaces “empty place” with concrete atmosphere.\n- Give us a reflective beat that matches the whimsical tone when you see the whale: one line of internal narration connects your fascination to why it “knows a secret,” e.g., “It had the sleepy smile of someone who’s already won.”\n- Vary sentence lengths: keep your short, punchy lines (“It clattered.”), but let one or two longer sentences carry mood. You already do this—just tighten the long ones to avoid run-ons.\n\nFormatting Guidance (standard manuscript)\n- Use 12-point Times New Roman, double-spaced, 1-inch margins, left-aligned, and indent the first line of each paragraph by 0.5 inches.\n- Include a header with your last name, story title (shortened if needed), and page number on each page (top right).\n- Dialogue punctuation:\n  - Keep punctuation inside the quotation marks: “You coming?”\n  - Use a lower-case dialogue tag if it continues the sentence: “You coming?” Jay said.\n  - Consider a period and new sentence when shifting focus: “You coming?” Jay said. I was already…\n\nWould you like me to generate a fully revised version in past tense (or present, if you prefer), incorporating all the suggested changes and pacing tweaks? I can also add one or two subtle sensory details to deepen the mood while preserving your voice.\n\nAnything else you want me to prioritize—word count, submission guidelines, or specific magazine preferences?"

Uses present tense appropriate for general scientific statements.\n\n- Original: “It is believed that higher temperature increases kinetic energy and thus more effective collisions occurs.”\n  - Edited: “Higher temperature increases kinetic energy, leading to more frequent and effective collisions.”\n  - Reasoning: Avoids hedging (“It is believed”) for established theory; fixes subject–verb agreement (“collisions occur,” not “occurs”); improves flow with a causal phrase.\n\nResults\n- Original: “The solution was heated to 30C, 40C, and 50C and the time to color change were recorded as 45s, 31s, and 19s respectively (see table 1).”\n  - Edited: “We heated the solution to 30 °C, 40 °C, and 50 °C and recorded times to color change of 45 s, 31 s, and 19 s, respectively (see Table 1).”\n  - Reasoning: Switches to active voice; corrects units (space between number and unit; degree symbol; seconds as “s”); fixes capitalization of “Table”; clarifies subject–verb agreement by making “times” plural; adds a comma before “respectively.”\n\n- Original: “There is an apparent trend showing rate goes up when temperature was raised.”\n  - Edited: “An apparent trend was observed: the reaction rate increased as temperature increased.”\n  - Reasoning: Uses past tense for Results; replaces informal phrasing (“rate goes up”) with objective wording; keeps focus on rate while aligning tense.\n\n- Original: “Figure 2 shows the line of best fit which seems kind of steep.”\n  - Edited: “Figure 2 shows the line of best fit, indicating a steep positive slope.”\n  - Reasoning: Improves precision and removes informal language (“kind of”); clarifies what “steep” implies; maintains present tense for figure description, which is acceptable.\n\nOverall feedback\n- Clarity improved by directly stating collision theory and its implications.\n- Passive constructions were minimized in Results; active voice improves readability and accountability.\n- Tense is now consistent: present for theory; past for procedure/observations; present for figure reference (acceptable), kept consistent within the section.\n- Units and references are standardized to align with scientific and APA conventions.\n\nSpelling edits\n- “occurs” → “occur” (subject–verb agreement: plural “collisions” take “occur”).\n- “table 1” → “Table 1” (capitalize specific table/figure references).\n- Add degree symbol and spacing: “30C” → “30 °C,” “40C” → “40 °C,” “50C” → “50 °C.”\n- Add spacing for units: “45s” → “45 s,” “31s” → “31 s,” “19s” → “19 s.”\n\nGrammar edits\n- “is being affected” → “is affected” (use simple present for general truths).\n- “It is believed that…” → remove hedging for established theory (objective tone).\n- “time to color change were recorded” → “recorded times to color change” or “the time to color change was recorded” (fix subject–verb agreement).\n- Replace informal phrasing (“rate goes up,” “kind of steep”) with precise scientific language (“rate increased,” “steep positive slope”).\n- Use consistent tense in the Results section (predominantly past tense).\n\nStructural suggestions\n- Introduction:\n  - Begin with the general principle (collision theory) and directly link temperature to kinetic energy and collision frequency/effectiveness.\n  - End the Introduction with a brief, testable expectation: e.g., “Therefore, increasing temperature is expected to increase the reaction rate.”\n- Results:\n  - Start with conditions and measurements (temperatures and times) and reference the table immediately.\n  - Interpret the trend next, noting that shorter times imply higher rates.\n  - Reference the figure to support the trend and describe what the line of best fit indicates (slope direction and steepness).\n\nOpportunities for improvement\n- Clarify the relationship between time and rate: explicitly note that decreasing time to color change implies an increased reaction rate (rate ∝ 1/time). You don’t need to add calculations; a one-sentence note would strengthen interpretation.\n- If appropriate, specify whether the line of best fit was linear and whether R² was reported. This adds rigor without changing reported numbers.\n- Briefly state any controls (e.g., constant volume, concentration) in Results or Methods, if available, to reinforce validity.\n\nFormatting guidance (APA 7th edition)\n- Headings:\n  - Use Level 1 headings for major sections: centered, bold, title case (e.g., “Introduction,” “Results”).\n- Tables:\n  - In text: Capitalize and number (e.g., “as shown in Table 1”).\n  - Placement: Insert the table after the first mention.\n  - Caption: On a separate line above the table—Table number in bold (Table 1) and title in italics, Title Case (concise and descriptive).\n  - Example:\n    - Table 1\n    - Italicized, Descriptive Title of Temperature and Color-Change Times\n- Figures:\n  - In text: Capitalize and number (e.g., “Figure 2 shows…”).\n  - Placement: Insert the figure after the first mention.\n  - Caption: Figure number in bold (Figure 2) on its own line, followed by an italicized, Title Case caption below.\n  - Example:\n    - Figure 2\n    - Italicized, Line of Best Fit for Reaction Rate vs. Temperature\n- Units:\n  - Use SI style with a space between number and unit (45 s; 30 °C).\n  - Keep consistent unit abbreviations throughout and avoid mixing spelled-out units with abbreviations within the same context.\n\nOffer to generate the edited text\nWould you like me to produce the edited excerpts with APA headings and improved figure/table references?

I can give line-by-line edits with reasoning, structural suggestions for a strong narrative arc, opportunities to deepen the essay, and formatting guidance to fit the 650-word limit while keeping your voice sincere, reflective, and confident but humble.\n\nQuick questions to tailor the edits:\n- Is this the full essay or an excerpt from a longer draft (you mentioned ~590 words)? If there’s more, please paste it so I can edit the whole piece line by line.\n- Do you have a specific prompt or theme you’re responding to?\n- Are there particular outcomes you want to highlight (for example, how the website affected the business, any community responses, or how this experience connects to your interests in college)?\n\nOverview of how I’ll help:\n- Sharpen clarity and tone without losing authenticity.\n- Strengthen the arc from early responsibility to concrete action to reflection and future goals.\n- Suggest precise word choices and small grammar fixes for polish.\n- Recommend structural additions (brief scenes, concrete outcomes, and a tight closing) to reach 600–650 words.\n\nOverall Feedback:\n- Strengths: The opening image (translating bank forms), the concrete action during the pandemic, and the reflection on community are compelling and genuine. Your voice feels grounded and humble.\n- Opportunities: Add one or two vivid micro-scenes (e.g., a moment in the bank office or delivering a flyer) and a specific outcome (e.g., increased orders, messages from customers). Clarify the connection to college by naming the broader skills or areas you hope to develop (e.g., navigating systems, communications, community organizing, business/tech tools).\n- Arc: You already have a clear arc—responsibility → action → learning → purpose. Strengthen it with concrete details and a tighter final sentence that shows how you’ll build on this in college.\n\nLine-by-line edits with reasoning:\n1) “Growing up as a first-generation Mexican American, I often translated bank forms for my parents and tried to make sense of bills with unfamiliar words.”\n- Suggested edit: “…and tried to make sense of bills full of unfamiliar terms.”\n- Reason: “terms” is more precise in formal contexts; keeps your tone intact.\n\n2) “At first, I felt small in those offices, like I was pretending to be older.”\n- Suggested edit: “…as if I were pretending to be older.”\n- Reason: “as if I were” is more formal and grammatically standard in reflective prose; it preserves your meaning.\n\n3) “Over time, I realized I was learning a language of responsibility.”\n- Suggested edit: “…the language of responsibility.”\n- Reason: “the language” gives the metaphor more weight and specificity.\n\n4) “When my mom’s small catering business almost closed during the pandemic, I made flyers, wrote emails, and built a simple website on my cracked phone.”\n- Suggested edits:\n  - “…was on the brink of closing…” (instead of “almost closed”)\n  - “…and built a simple website using my cracked phone.”\n- Reason: “on the brink of closing” is idiomatic and vivid; “using” is the accurate preposition for tools.\n\n5) “It wasn’t perfect, but it worked, and we kept going.”\n- Suggested edit: “It wasn’t perfect, but it worked. We kept going.”\n- Reason: Splitting the sentence improves rhythm and avoids a pile-up of commas; the short second sentence adds emphasis.\n\n6) “This taught me how community isn’t a slogan; it’s people showing up for each other.”\n- Suggested edit: “This taught me that community isn’t a slogan; it’s people showing up for each other.”\n- Reason: “that” is the correct conjunction for a statement of realization.\n\n7) “I still worry about sounding ‘right,’ but I’ve learned to ask questions and keep trying even when I’m unsure.”\n- Optional tweak: “I still worry about sounding ‘right,’ but I’ve learned to ask questions and keep trying, even when I’m unsure.”\n- Reason: A comma before the final clause smooths pacing; keeping the quotes preserves your voice.\n\n8) “College, to me, is a place to grow that force of trying into something that can help others, especially families navigating systems that pretend to be simple.”\n- Suggested edit: “To me, college is a place to turn that persistence into work that helps others—especially families navigating systems that seem simple on the surface.”\n- Reason: “turn that persistence into work” tightens the abstract phrase; “seem simple on the surface” softens the tone slightly while preserving your point.\n\nSpelling Edits:\n- “first-generation” is correctly hyphenated.\n- “Mexican American” is correct; no hyphen needed in this usage.\n- “flyers” is fine (U.S. usage). “fliers” is also acceptable; choose one and use it consistently.\n\nGrammar Edits:\n- Prefer “as if I were” to “like I was” for formal tone.\n- Use “that” after “taught me” for correct syntax.\n- Consider splitting longer compound sentences (as in “It wasn’t perfect, but it worked. We kept going.”).\n- Replace “on my cracked phone” with “using my cracked phone” for idiomatic clarity.\n\nStructural Suggestions (to reach ~600–650 words):\n- Paragraph 1 (hook + context): Keep your opening but add a micro-scene (e.g., a moment in the bank office with a specific phrase you translated and how it made you feel). 120–150 words.\n- Paragraph 2 (challenge + actions): Expand the pandemic period. Describe your strategy briefly (creating flyers, writing emails, what you put on the website), and include one concrete outcome (e.g., number of new orders, partnerships, a thank-you message). 200–250 words.\n- Paragraph 3 (reflection): Tie your actions to a broader lesson—learning to ask questions, demystifying systems, building trust. 120–150 words.\n- Paragraph 4 (forward-looking close): Connect the skills and mindset to what you hope to develop in college (e.g., tools for small businesses or families, communication, data, policy, tech). End with a concise return to your opening metaphor (“the language of responsibility” and community). 120–150 words.\n\nOpportunities for Improvement:\n- Add one brief, concrete detail about the website (e.g., menu photos, order form, testimonials) and how you spread the word (texts, local Facebook groups, church bulletin).\n- Include a measurable or observable result to show impact.\n- Show a moment of uncertainty and how you resolved it (e.g., teaching yourself a website builder, asking a librarian for help).\n- Name transferable skills: translating complex information, perseverance, community-building, communication.\n- Clarify your future direction (fields or skills you want to build) without locking into a major: this helps admissions readers see growth potential.\n\nFormatting Guidance (650-word limit, admissions conventions):\n- Aim for 3–5 short paragraphs with clear transitions.\n- Vary sentence lengths; avoid long strings of clauses.\n- Standard punctuation is best; an em dash or semicolon is fine sparingly.\n- Keep language clean and direct; avoid jargon.\n- Stay under 650 words; 600–640 reads well and leaves room for final polishing.\n\nWould you like me to:\n- Edit the full ~590-word draft line by line?\n- Or expand this excerpt into a polished 600–650-word essay that incorporates these suggestions while keeping your voice?\n\nIf you want, I can also generate a revised version of this paragraph now, incorporating the specific edits above."

      "groundtruth": "Thanks for sharing your poem. I’ll focus on improving word choice, capitalization, punctuation, and tense consistency while preserving your line breaks, imagery, and free-verse feel. Before I propose a final edited version, a couple of quick questions to make sure my edits match your intent:\n- Do you want a consistent lowercase style (including “i”), or standard capitalization throughout? Your current poem mixes both.\n- Are you open to small tense tweaks to keep the poem present-focused?\n- Do you prefer parentheses for asides, or would you like to use em dashes for a more seamless, lyrical flow?\n\nOverview of the editorial approach\n- Correct the single spelling error.\n- Smooth tense consistency so the poem stays present-focused.\n- Suggest a consistent capitalization approach (either all-lowercase for a lyrical, contemplative tone or standard capitalization for a more formal journal style).\n- Offer subtle punctuation adjustments (em dashes vs commas/parentheses) to enhance cadence.\n- Provide optional word-choice refinements that keep your metaphors intact.\n- Offer an optional stanza break to heighten the emotional turn.\n\nLine-by-line edits with reasoning\n- Line 1: “the sun dropps behind the hill—”\n  - Change “dropps” to “drops” (spelling).\n  - Keep the em dash; it works well as a lingering pause and sets the contemplative tone.\n  - Capitalization choice: if you go all-lowercase, this line is already aligned.\n\n- Line 2: “i chase the day like a late bus,”\n  - This line reads well. The simile is vivid and contemporary.\n  - Capitalization choice: keep “i” lowercase if you choose the all-lowercase style; otherwise change to “I.”\n\n- Line 3: “shoes unlaced, the gravel keeps my secrets.”\n  - The comma works, but consider an em dash for a more lyrical hinge: “shoes unlaced—the gravel keeps my secrets.”\n  - Reason: the dash strengthens the connection and adds a musical pause. The phrase “keeps my secrets” is strong; if you want a tactile nuance, “holds” is an option, but “keeps” maintains the confidentiality image.\n\n- Line 4: “I call the trees my witnesses”\n  - For capitalization consistency, use either “i” (if all-lowercase) or keep “I” and adjust earlier lines to standard case.\n  - Optional word choice: “name the trees my witnesses” is slightly more formal/ceremonial; “call” is more conversational. Choose based on the tone you want.\n\n- Line 5: “and they don’t answer (they never did)”\n  - Tense consistency: change “did” to “do” to keep the poem in the present: “and they don’t answer (they never do).”\n  - If you prefer a seamless flow, consider an em dash instead of parentheses: “and they don’t answer— they never do.” Parentheses feel more self-aware; em dashes feel more embedded in the voice.\n\n- Line 6: “but the leaves clap anyway, a small stadium.”\n  - Consider an em dash to clarify the apposition: “but the leaves clap anyway—a small stadium.”\n  - Reason: the dash emphasizes “a small stadium” as a metaphorical rename rather than a loose addition. If you prefer a simile, “like a small stadium” is also clear, but the metaphor is stronger as-is.\n\n- Line 7: “tomorrow is a folded map in my pocket”\n  - Strong image; reads clearly. No changes needed.\n  - If you adopt standard capitalization, capitalize “Tomorrow.”\n\n- Line 8: “that I forgot to unfold.”\n  - Tense consistency: shift to present perfect for cohesion with the rest of the poem: “that I haven’t yet unfolded.”\n  - If you prefer a more direct phrasing, you can end the poem with an em dash for a quiet, suspended feeling:\n    - “that I haven’t yet unfolded—”\n    - Or add the pronoun for clarity: “that I haven’t yet unfolded it.” (This slightly reduces the elegance; the noun “map” already carries the action.)\n\nOverall Feedback\n- Strengths: Your imagery is vivid and coherent—the late bus, witnesses of trees, stadium of leaves, and the folded map work together as a persuasive meditation on urgency and intention. Sound devices like “shoes,” “secrets,” and “stadium” give the poem soft consonance. The em dash in line 1 sets a reflective pace that suits the lyrical tone.\n- Main improvements: Correct the spelling error, unify capitalization, and maintain present-tense consistency. A few punctuation adjustments can heighten the rhythm and clarity without changing your metaphors.\n\nSpelling Edits\n- “dropps” → “drops”\n  - Reason: Standard spelling.\n\nGrammar Edits\n- Tense consistency:\n  - “(they never did)” → “(they never do)” to keep present tense across the poem.\n  - “that I forgot to unfold” → “that I haven’t yet unfolded” to align with present-focused narration.\n- Capitalization consistency:\n  - Choose one of the following:\n    - All-lowercase style for a contemplative, modern feel: “i” throughout; keep line-initial words lowercase.\n    - Standard capitalization for literary journal formality: Capitalize “The,” “I,” “Tomorrow,” and sentence beginnings.\n\nStructural Suggestions\n- Consider a stanza break after line 6 to separate the external scene (chasing day, trees, leaves) from the inward turn (tomorrow as a map). For example:\n  - Stanza 1: lines 1–6\n  - Stanza 2: lines 7–8\n  - Reason: It creates a clean pivot from witness/response to intention/future.\n\nOpportunities for Improvement\n- Punctuation cadence:\n  - Line 3: Em dash instead of comma can strengthen the hinge between action and secrecy.\n  - Line 6: Em dash before “a small stadium” clarifies apposition and heightens the image.\n- Optional word-choice refinements (only if desired):\n  - “call” → “name” for a ceremonial tone.\n  - “keeps” → “holds” for tactile resonance. These are stylistic, not necessary.\n\nFormatting Guidance\n- Em dashes: Use a true em dash (—) with no surrounding spaces for a clean, contemporary look, as you’ve done in line 1. If you add more dashes, keep that convention consistent.\n- Parenthetical aside vs em dash: Parentheses create a thoughtful whisper; em dashes integrate the aside into the line’s flow. Either is acceptable—choose one style and apply it consistently.\n- Capitalization:\n  - All-lowercase is an accepted poetry convention and suits a contemplative tone; ensure “i” is consistently lowercase if you choose this.\n  - If the journal favors standard capitalization, use sentence case for lines that form complete sentences.\n- Line breaks: Your current breaks work well and should be preserved. If you add a stanza break after line 6, insert one blank line between stanzas.\n\nWould you like me to generate the edited poem? I can provide:\n- Version A: all-lowercase with em dashes (contemplative style).\n- Version B: standard capitalization with either em dashes or parentheses (more formal journal style).\n\nIf you have a preference on parentheses vs em dashes and capitalization style, tell me which you’d like, and I’ll produce the polished version accordingly."

Evaluating the book’s symbolism, pacing, and thematic depth, I argue that Lowry’s use of color powerfully represents freedom and choice, the mid-book pacing reduces urgency, and the ending—though ambiguous—invites thoughtful discussion.\n\nSummary (early plot only):\nJonas lives in an orderly society designed to eliminate conflict and difference. Early in the novel, he notices an apple “change,” a moment that foreshadows his changing perception of the world and hints that not everything in his community is what it seems.\n\nAnalysis:\nColor functions as a symbol of individuality and possibility, contrasting with the community’s uniform uniformity. As Jonas’s perceptions broaden, Lowry suggests that true choice requires the ability to perceive differences, linking the novel’s exploration of memory to moral responsibility. While the middle sections slow, the measured pacing mirrors the community’s controlled routine and emphasizes how difficult it is to disrupt a system built on predictability.\n\nConclusion:\nAlthough the ending resists a tidy resolution, its openness is effective because it pushes readers to consider what safety costs and who pays that price. Overall, I recommend The Giver because it prompts reflection on choices, memory, and the price of safety.\n\nWould you like me to:\n- Expand the analysis with one more early-text quote?\n- Add MLA in-text citations with page numbers from your edition?\n- Format a complete Works Cited section based on your edition details?"

If you schedule shorter blocks and accept B+ work at first, you will move faster.”\n  - Suggestion: “Perfectionism is a trap. Schedule shorter time blocks and accept B+ work initially—you’ll move faster.”\n  - Reason: Imperative form is more direct for web; “time blocks” adds clarity; “initially” is smoother; em dash creates a tight conclusion.\n\n- H2: “## Conclusion”\n  - Suggestion: Keep as is.\n\n- Conclusion body: “Doing less is surprisingly brave. You will feel weird at first, but then free.”\n  - Suggestion: “Doing less can be surprisingly brave. It may feel uncomfortable at first, but the payoff is freedom.”\n  - Reason: “Can be” softens the claim, “uncomfortable” is clearer than “weird,” and “payoff is freedom” lands with a stronger, positive close.\n\nOverall Feedback\n- Strong core idea and friendly tone. The simple, actionable tips fit a productivity audience.\n- Key improvements: fix tense consistency, “less” vs. “fewer,” and make headings uniform and scannable. Add micro-examples or bullets under each tip for quick takeaways.\n\nSpelling Edits\n- No outright spelling errors found.\n- Consistency: “Twitter” is correctly capitalized. Consider consistent quotation style (single vs. double quotes). For web headings, you can drop quotes.\n\nGrammar Edits\n- Past tense in the intro: “need” → “needed.”\n- Count vs. mass nouns: “less options/tabs” → “fewer options/fewer tabs”; “less guilt” stays “less.”\n- Idiomatic phrasing: “bad loop I had” → “habit I fell into.”\n- Parallel structure and concision: remove “If” and use imperative in Tip 2 for a tighter message.\n\nStructural Suggestions\n- Use H2 for each tip and H3 for brief examples or mini-checklists.\n- Add scannable bullets under each tip:\n  - Tip 1 bullets:\n    - Try this: Write 3 things to ignore today (e.g., “Twitter refresh,” “email tabs after 7 p.m.,” “new app trials”).\n    - Why it works: Reduces decision fatigue and removes low-value distractions.\n  - Tip 2 bullets:\n    - Try this: Set a 25–30 minute block; define “B+” criteria (clear, complete, not perfect).\n    - Why it works: Time-boxing + “good-enough” standard speeds momentum.\n- Consider a short one-line hook before the intro to grab attention (optional): “The fastest way I beat procrastination? I started doing less.”\n- Keep paragraphs short (1–3 sentences) and avoid long clauses for readability.\n\nOpportunities for Improvement\n- Add one sentence to connect the two tips: “Both strategies eliminate decision friction so you can start faster.”\n- Optional CTA: Invite readers to try one change today and share results (e.g., comment or share).\n- If you plan to add links (e.g., to a Not-To-Do template or a time-boxing guide), place them at the end of each tip with descriptive anchor text.\n\nFormatting Guidance (web style: H2/H3, short paragraphs, bullets)\n- Headings:\n  - H2: Tip titles (Title Case, avoid quotes when possible).\n  - H3: Example or “Try this” under each tip.\n- Paragraphs: 1–3 sentences each; aim for ~15–20 words per sentence.\n- Bullets: Use simple, parallel phrasing; start with verbs (“Write,” “Set,” “Define”).\n- Links: Use descriptive anchors (“Not-To-Do template”), keep them intact, and place them after the relevant sentence or as a bullet.\n- Punctuation: Use em dashes sparingly for emphasis; avoid exclamation points unless intentional for tone.\n- Consistency: Use Title Case for headings; sentence case in body copy.\n\nWould you like me to generate a clean, edited version with H2/H3 headings, short paragraphs, and bullets, incorporating all these changes? I can also add an optional checklist under each tip and placeholder spots for any links you plan to include."

Consider one brief clause clarifying “microplastics” if needed (e.g., “microplastics—small plastic particles—”); optional.\n- Methods: One sentence stating the filter materials (natural fibers), sample source (local creek), and measurement approach (DIY microscope rig).\n- Results: One sentence with the two quantitative outcomes, units, and time frame.\n- Conclusion: One sentence noting limitations and the potential for classroom scaling. If space allows, a neutral implication about future optimization (e.g., “Further work will address flow consistency and clogging”) can be added without altering claims.\n\nOpportunities for improvement\n- If available, add the number of trials or samples to bolster rigor.\n- Clarify what “filtration rates” refers to (e.g., flow rate or throughput) if judges may ask.\n- Specify the type of natural fibers (e.g., cotton, jute) if that detail is permissible and available.\n\nFormatting guidance\n- Keep the abstract as a single paragraph under 250 words.\n- Define acronyms/units at first use: do-it-yourself (DIY), micrometers (μm).\n- Avoid symbols like “>”; use words (“greater than”).\n- Maintain an objective tone and past tense for methods/results.\n\nWould you like me to incorporate these edits into a polished version now?\n\nEdited abstract (250-word limit, no first person, acronyms defined)\nPlastic waste in waterways is increasing.

Also, do you have a target word count?\n\nH2: Overview of Editorial Approach\n- Focus: Make the summary crisp, correct grammar and tone, and strengthen structure for small business owners.\n- Method: Line-by-line edits with reasoning, then structural and formatting guidance using H2/H3 headings, bullets, and bold key terms.\n- Constraints respected: All figures retained; no new claims; confident, clear, non-hype tone.\n\nH2: Overall Feedback\n- The core message is clear, but sentences can be tightened and reordered for logical flow: Problem → Solution → Results → Plan → Risks.\n- Grammar adjustments (subject–verb agreement, article use, punctuation) will improve clarity and professionalism.\n- Avoid contractions for a formal executive summary, and use precise, parallel phrasing.\n\nH2: Line-by-Line Edits with Reasoning\n- Original: “Our platform helps local shops get discovered by nearby customers using geo-targeted notifications and simple onboarding.”\n  - Edited: “Our platform helps local shops get discovered by nearby customers through geo‑targeted notifications and a simple onboarding process.”\n  - Reasoning: “Through” clarifies the mechanism; “a simple onboarding process” adds the missing article and uses parallel noun phrasing.\n\n- Original: “The problem is small shops don’t have time or money to run ads that works.”\n  - Edited: “The problem: small shops do not have the time or budget to run ads that work.”\n  - Reasoning: Remove filler (“The problem is”), avoid contraction (“do not”), add articles (“the”), use “budget” for business tone, and fix subject–verb agreement (“ads that work”).\n\n- Original: “With our pilot of 18 stores, average foot traffic increased 12% in 6 weeks, with 9 stores renewing for the next quarter.”\n  - Edited: “In a pilot with 18 stores, average foot traffic increased 12% over six weeks; nine stores renewed for the next quarter.”\n  - Reasoning: “In a pilot with…” reads cleaner; “over six weeks” is idiomatic; semicolon connects closely related results; spell out numbers under 10 for consistency.\n\n- Original: “We plan to scale to 100 stores by Q3 with a break-even at 320 paying locations.”\n  - Edited: “We plan to scale to 100 stores by Q3; we break even at 320 paying locations.”\n  - Reasoning: Split the sentence for clarity; use present tense for a standing financial threshold; hyphen unnecessary when “break even” functions as a verb.\n\n- Original: “Risks include churn and notification fatigue which we plan to mitigate with controls.”\n  - Edited: “Risks include churn and notification fatigue, which we plan to mitigate with controls.”\n  - Reasoning: Add the comma before the nonrestrictive clause; keep “controls” as stated without adding new claims.\n\nH2: Spelling Edits\n- “geo-targeted” → keep hyphenated as “geo‑targeted” for consistency with compound modifiers.\n- “onboarding” → correct as one word.\n- Numbers: Spell out “six” and “nine” for readability; keep larger figures numeric (12%, 18, 100, 320, Q3).\n\nH2: Grammar Edits\n- Subject–verb agreement: “ads that works” → “ads that work.”\n- Article usage: Add “a” before “simple onboarding process”; add “the” before “time or budget.”\n- Tense consistency:\n  - Present: platform capability and break-even threshold.\n  - Past: pilot results.\n  - Future: scaling plan.\n- Punctuation: Use a semicolon to link closely related independent clauses; add comma for nonrestrictive clause (“fatigue, which…”).\n\nH2: Structural Suggestions\n- Use a Problem → Solution → Results → Plan → Risks order for immediate comprehension.\n- Separate metrics into the Results section to highlight impact.\n- Keep sentences short (10–18 words) and parallel for scannability.\n- Consider labeled bullets if your audience prefers quick scanning.\n\nH2: Opportunities for Improvement\n- Clarify “controls” briefly if allowed (e.g., frequency or relevance controls). If not, keep as is to avoid new claims.\n- If you have a specific pricing or definition of “paying locations,” you can include it in a later section, not the executive summary.\n\nH2: Formatting Guidance\n- H2: Executive Summary\n  - H3: Problem\n    - Small shops do not have the time or budget to run ads that work.\n  - H3: Solution\n    - Our platform helps local shops get discovered by nearby customers through geo‑targeted notifications and a simple onboarding process.\n  - H3: Results\n    - In a pilot with 18 stores, average foot traffic increased 12% over six weeks; nine stores renewed for the next quarter.\n  - H3: Plan\n    - Scale to 100 stores by Q3; break even at 320 paying locations.\n  - H3: Risks\n    - Risks include churn and notification fatigue, which we plan to mitigate with controls.\n- Use bold for key metrics and terms (e.g., “12%,” “Q3,” “320 paying locations,” “geo‑targeted notifications”).\n\nH2: Proposed Edited Executive Summary (Bullet Format)\n- H3: Problem\n  - Small shops do not have the time or budget to run ads that work.\n- H3: Solution\n  - Our platform helps local shops get discovered by nearby customers through geo‑targeted notifications and a simple onboarding process.\n- H3: Results\n  - In a pilot with 18 stores, average foot traffic increased 12% over six weeks; nine stores renewed for the next quarter.\n- H3: Plan\n  - Scale to 100 stores by Q3; break even at 320 paying locations.\n- H3: Risks\n  - Risks include churn and notification fatigue, which we plan to mitigate with controls.\n\nWould you like me to deliver this as a single paragraph version, or keep the labeled bullets?

      "groundtruth": "Thanks for sharing your outline and goals. I can turn this into a coherent, motivational speech with smooth transitions, and provide line-by-line edits, structural suggestions, and speaking-note formatting. Before I finalize, two quick questions:\n- Is a brief personal anecdote okay to include (you mention “I felt it last semester”)?\n- Does your assignment require at least one cited statistic, or is a general reference to research acceptable?\n\nOverview of approach\n- Tighten each line for grammar, clarity, and parallel structure.\n- Add transitions that connect each section and build momentum.\n- Expand the solution into clear, actionable steps that fit a 5–6 minute delivery.\n- Format the speaking outline with cue words and timing estimates so it’s easy to deliver.\n\nOverall Feedback\n- Strengths: Clear problem-solution frame, relatable hook, concise plan with three practical steps, strong close and call to action.\n- Main improvements: Use subjunctive grammar in the hook, add a specific example in the evidence section, strengthen the counterargument, and smooth transitions between sections. Keep each step behaviorally specific so your audience can try it for 7 days.\n\nSpelling Edits (with reasoning)\n- grayscale → correct as one word. Reason: Standard usage for display setting.\n- no-phone mornings → keep hyphenated. Reason: Hyphen clarifies the compound adjective.\n- check-ins → include hyphen. Reason: “Check-in” is hyphenated in noun form; plural is “check-ins.”\n- “Screen time going up; attention going down.” → Keep “screen time” as two words; “attention” is correct.\n\nGrammar Edits (with reasoning)\n- Hook: “Imagine if your phone is the boss of you.” → “Imagine if your phone were the boss of you.” Reason: Use the subjunctive “were” for a hypothetical.\n- Evidence: “grades slipping, sleep shorter, I felt it last semester.” → “Grades slipped, my sleep got shorter, and I felt it last semester.” Reason: Parallel verb forms and add a conjunction to avoid a comma splice.\n- Counter: “Phones are tools—yes, but tools shape us.” → “Phones are tools—yes. But tools also shape us.” Reason: Split into two sentences for emphasis; “also” signals concession with contrast.\n- Solution: “3 steps: grayscale, no-phone mornings, buddy check-ins.” → “Three steps: turn on grayscale, try no-phone mornings, and set up buddy check-ins.” Reason: Spell out “three” in speech and use parallel imperative phrases.\n- Close: “Ask audience to try it for 7 days.” → “Ask the audience to try it for seven days.” Reason: Spell out single-digit numbers in speech.\n\nStructural Suggestions (with reasoning)\n- Order: Hook → Problem → Evidence (personal and one brief stat) → Counterargument → Solution (three steps) → Call to Action → Close. Reason: This sequence builds logic and motivation, keeping the audience engaged.\n- Add transitions: Use “Here’s what that looks like,” “But there’s a catch,” and “So what can we do?” to guide listeners.\n- Make each step concrete: Add “how,” “when,” and “why it helps” for each step to increase follow-through and fit the 7-day challenge.\n- Time cues: Aim for roughly 30–45 seconds per early section, 2 minutes for the solution, and 1 minute for the call to action and close, totaling about 5–6 minutes.\n\nOpportunities for Improvement\n- Include one credible data point on attention, grades, or sleep (e.g., a brief stat from the CDC, APA, or a school survey). Keep it short: one sentence.\n- Add a one-sentence personal anecdote to humanize the problem.\n- Offer a simple way to measure progress (e.g., “Notice how many times you pick up your phone before lunch,” or “Track sleep for seven days”).\n- Preempt objections: Acknowledge phones help us study and connect; you’re offering small guardrails, not a ban.\n\nFormatting Guidance for Speaking Notes\n- Use clear section headers in ALL CAPS: HOOK, PROBLEM, EVIDENCE, COUNTER, SOLUTION, CALL TO ACTION, CLOSE.\n- Keep one idea per line; aim for short phrases, not full paragraphs.\n- Add cue words in brackets: [PAUSE], [LOOK UP], [SLOW DOWN], [SHOW OF HANDS].\n- Put transitions on their own lines to help delivery.\n- Include approximate time per section, so you hit 5–6 minutes.\n- Bold is optional; if not available, use caps for emphasis; underline key phrases by writing them in caps (e.g., YOU DESERVE YOUR ATTENTION BACK).\n\nEdited Speaking Outline (5–6 minutes, with cue words)\nHOOK (0:30)\n- Imagine if your phone were the boss of you. [PAUSE] What would it tell you to do—now, now, now? [LOOK UP]\n  Reason: Subjunctive “were” for hypothetical; short punchy questions create engagement.\n\nPROBLEM (0:45)\n- Our screen time is going up; our attention is going down. [PAUSE]\n- The cost? More distraction, less deep focus, and decisions that feel rushed.\n  Reason: Parallel structure (“going up / going down”); names concrete consequences.\n\nEVIDENCE (1:00)\n- Quick stat: Research links heavy screen use with shorter sleep and lower academic performance. [PAUSE]\n- My example: Last semester, my grades slipped and my sleep got shorter because I kept scrolling past midnight. [SLOW DOWN]\n  Reason: One concise research claim, plus a personal anecdote to ground the message.\n\nCOUNTERARGUMENT (0:45)\n- Phones are tools—yes. But tools also shape us. [PAUSE]\n- I’m not saying ditch your phone; I’m saying add small guardrails so the tool serves you. [LOOK UP]\n  Reason: Acknowledge benefits; reframe as balance, not abstinence.\n\nTRANSITION (0:10)\n- So what can we do—starting this week? [PAUSE]\n  Reason: Signals the move to solutions and the 7-day challenge.\n\nSOLUTION: THREE STEPS (2:00)\n- Step 1: Turn on grayscale. [PAUSE]\n  - How: Switch your display to grayscale after 8 p.m. on weekdays. [PAUSE]\n  - Why: Less color = fewer “click me” cues; it makes late-night scrolling less tempting.\n  Reason: Imperative framing; time-bound instruction increases follow-through.\n\n- Step 2: No-phone mornings. [PAUSE]\n  - How: For the first 30 minutes after you wake up, no social apps or texts. Start with water, stretch, and your first task. [LOOK UP]\n  - Why: Protects your freshest attention; sets your focus before notifications set it for you.\n  Reason: Concrete duration and replacement behaviors reduce friction.\n\n- Step 3: Buddy check-ins. [PAUSE]\n  - How: Pair with a classmate today; send a one-line check-in each morning for seven days (“Grayscale on, 30-min no-phone done”). [SMILE]\n  - Why: Accountability beats willpower. Share wins; reset if you slip.\n  Reason: Simple script lowers barrier; normalizes imperfection.\n\nCALL TO ACTION (0:45)\n- Try these three steps for seven days. Start tonight: grayscale at 8 p.m. [PAUSE]\n- Tomorrow morning: 30 minutes no phone. [PAUSE]\n- Before you leave class: pick a buddy. [SHOW OF HANDS] Who’s in?\n  Reason: Break CTA into immediate, next, and today actions; invite participation.\n\nCLOSE (0:30)\n- You deserve your attention back. [PAUSE] Give it seven days—and see what changes.\n- If it helps, keep it. If not, adjust. But let your phone serve you, not boss you. [LOOK UP]\n  Reason: Motivational yet grounded; emphasizes autonomy and experiment.\n\nLine-by-line Edits with Reasoning (comparing your original lines)\n- Hook: “Imagine if your phone is the boss of you.” → “Imagine if your phone were the boss of you.”\n  Reason: The subjunctive “were” fits hypothetical statements; it also sounds more polished in speech.\n\n- Problem: “Screen time going up; attention going down.” → “Our screen time is going up; our attention is going down.”\n  Reason: Add “our” for audience inclusion; keep parallel structure for rhythm.\n\n- Evidence: “grades slipping, sleep shorter, I felt it last semester.” → “My grades slipped, my sleep got shorter, and I felt it last semester.”\n  Reason: Use parallel past-tense verbs; add “my” for clarity and personal ownership; include “and” to avoid a comma splice.\n\n- Counter: “Phones are tools—yes, but tools shape us.” → “Phones are tools—yes. But tools also shape us.”\n  Reason: Split for emphasis; “also” signals concession then contrast, improving flow.\n\n- Solution: “3 steps: grayscale, no-phone mornings, buddy check-ins.” → “Three steps: turn on grayscale, try no-phone mornings, and set up buddy check-ins.”\n  Reason: Spell out numbers in speech; use parallel imperative phrases to make the plan actionable.\n\n- Close: “You deserve your attention back.” Ask audience to try it for 7 days. → “You deserve your attention back. Try it for seven days.”\n  Reason: Keep the impactful sentence; make the call to action direct; spell out “seven.”\n\nWould you like me to generate a full speech script based on this outline (about 900–1,000 words for 5–6 minutes)? I can also tailor the evidence section with a specific statistic if you share whether a citation is required."

      "groundtruth": "Thanks for sharing your narrative and goals. Before I dive in, quick check: Do you have a preferred tense for the narrative (e.g., mostly past tense with present reflections at the end), and is there any word count or teacher requirement I should keep in mind?\n\nOverview of the guidance I’ll provide\n- I’ll make line-by-line edits to fix tense consistency, clarify chronology, and improve sentence variety and flow while keeping all major events and avoiding fictional additions.\n- I’ll explain the reasoning for each change.\n- I’ll offer structural suggestions to strengthen the arc (injury → therapy → progress → track lesson).\n- I’ll point out opportunities to enhance clarity and reflection without inventing details.\n- I’ll provide formatting tips for a standard essay paragraph.\n\nOverall Feedback\n- The core idea is strong: the injury becomes the catalyst for a hopeful commitment to track and a lesson in patience and progress.\n- Your main challenge is tense inconsistency (mixing present and past) and a slightly unclear timeline.\n- With consistent past tense in the narrative and a present/reflection sentence at the end, the piece will read more smoothly and feel more confident.\n- A few small wording changes will clarify the chronology and improve sentence variety without changing your story.\n\nSpelling Edits\n- No spelling errors detected in the original text.\n\nGrammar Edits (line-by-line with reasoning)\n1) Original: “The day I broke my ankle is the day I decided to join track, which doesn’t make sense until I explain.”\n   Suggested edit: “The day I broke my ankle was the day I decided to join track—a choice that makes more sense once I explain.”\n   Reasoning:\n   - Switch “is” to “was” to match past-tense narration.\n   - “A choice that makes more sense once I explain” is slightly tighter and avoids the vague “which.”\n   - The em dash adds variety and emphasis.\n\n2) Original: “I am limping down the stairs last winter when the ice was invisible, and then I fell.”\n   Suggested edit: “Last winter, I was limping down the stairs when I hit invisible ice, and I fell.”\n   Reasoning:\n   - Change “I am limping” to “I was limping” to keep past tense with “last winter.”\n   - “Hit invisible ice” is a clear, concise phrase that explains the slip without adding new fictional detail.\n   - Replace “and then I fell” with “and I fell” to streamline the action.\n\n   Note: If “limping” here means you were already injured before this fall, consider clarifying. If you were just moving cautiously, “walking carefully” may be more precise. I didn’t change it because it might be true to your experience.\n\n3) Original: “Later, in physical therapy, I learn patience I didn’t know I had.”\n   Suggested edit: “Later, in physical therapy, I learned patience I didn’t know I had.”\n   Reasoning:\n   - “Learned” keeps the narrative in past tense.\n   - The rest of the sentence reads well and supports the reflective tone.\n\n4) Original: “By spring I was jogging, then I am running.”\n   Suggested edit: “By spring, I was jogging; then I was running.”\n   Reasoning:\n   - Make both verbs past tense for consistency.\n   - Use a semicolon to add sentence variety and show progression.\n   - Keep “then” to maintain your original timeline without adding specifics.\n\n5) Original: “Joining track taught me to measure progress in millimeters before it shows up as miles.”\n   Suggested edit (Option A, fully past tense): “Joining track taught me to measure progress in millimeters before it showed up as miles.”\n   Suggested edit (Option B, reflective present perfect): “Joining track has taught me to measure progress in millimeters before it shows up as miles.”\n   Reasoning:\n   - Option A keeps the entire piece in past tense.\n   - Option B shifts to present reflection at the end, which can feel more hopeful and ongoing. Choose based on your preference and teacher guidelines.\n\nStructural Suggestions\n- Keep this as one cohesive paragraph for a portfolio, but ensure the chronology is crystal clear:\n  1) Hook with the ankle-break/decision sentence.\n  2) Describe the fall (winter → stairs → invisible ice → fall).\n  3) Move to physical therapy and the patience lesson.\n  4) Mark progress (spring → jogging → running).\n  5) Conclude with the broader takeaway about measuring progress (either in past tense or present perfect).\n- Consider adding one brief transition phrase between therapy and spring to smooth the time jump, e.g., “After weeks of exercises,” only if it’s accurate to your experience. If not, the current “By spring…” works.\n- If you expand this for a longer essay, split into two paragraphs: (1) incident and decision; (2) recovery and lesson.\n\nOpportunities for Improvement\n- Clarify “limping”: If you were limping before the fall, a brief clarification would prevent confusion. If you weren’t, consider “walking carefully” or “moving slowly” (only if true).\n- Add one reflective phrase to deepen the hopeful tone without inventing events, e.g., “steady, patient steps” or “small gains that mattered”—only if these match your experience.\n- Vary sentence openings to avoid repetition (start one sentence with a time phrase, another with a participial phrase, etc.). The edits above already introduce some of this variety.\n\nFormatting Guidance\n- For a standard essay paragraph in a portfolio:\n  - Use Times New Roman or a similar serif font, 12-point, double-spaced, with 1-inch margins.\n  - Indent the first line of the paragraph.\n  - Keep consistent tense choice: either all past, or past with a final present-perfect reflection.\n  - Include a strong concluding sentence that ties the learning to your growth as a student/athlete.\n\nWould you like me to rewrite the paragraph with these edits applied? I can provide two versions (all past tense vs. ending in present perfect) so you can choose which fits your portfolio.\n\nIf helpful now, here are both edited versions:\n\nVersion A (all past tense):\n“The day I broke my ankle was the day I decided to join track—a choice that makes more sense once I explain. Last winter, I was limping down the stairs when I hit invisible ice, and I fell. Later, in physical therapy, I learned patience I didn’t know I had. By spring, I was jogging; then I was running. Joining track taught me to measure progress in millimeters before it showed up as miles.”\n\nVersion B (ending in present reflection):\n“The day I broke my ankle was the day I decided to join track—a choice that makes more sense once I explain. Last winter, I was limping down the stairs when I hit invisible ice, and I fell. Later, in physical therapy, I learned patience I didn’t know I had. By spring, I was jogging; then I was running. Joining track has taught me to measure progress in millimeters before it shows up as miles.”\n\nLet me know which you prefer, and if you want me to tweak “limping” based on what’s accurate to your experience or adjust tone further toward reflective/hopeful."

      "groundtruth": "Thanks for sharing your paragraph and goals. I’ll verify British English spelling and punctuation, fix any minor grammar issues, highlight UK vs US differences, and offer formatting tips suitable for a UK teacher. Before I begin: do you want to keep the past-tense reflective tone (“I realised… was…”) or would you prefer a present-perfect version (“I’ve realised… is…”) for immediacy? I’ll provide suggestions for both so you can choose.\n\nOverview of editorial guidance\n- I’ll review each sentence line-by-line for spelling (UK vs US), punctuation, and minor grammar.\n- I’ll flag optional style tweaks that could refine clarity or tone, without changing your voice.\n- I’ll include UK formatting guidance for a short reflective paragraph addressed to a teacher.\n\nOverall Feedback\n- The paragraph is clear, calm, and reflective—well suited to a UK teacher audience.\n- Your British spellings are consistent and correct (realised, favourite, programme, organise, colour-coded).\n- Punctuation and sentence structure are sound. Only optional refinements are worth considering (e.g., tense alignment or word choice like achievable vs possible).\n\nSpelling Edits (line-by-line with UK vs US notes)\n1) “I realised that my favourite part of the programme was how it helped me organise my thoughts.”\n   - realised (UK) vs realized (US): correct UK.\n   - favourite (UK) vs favorite (US): correct UK.\n   - programme (UK, for a course/series) vs program (US): correct UK.\n   - organise (UK -ise) vs organize (US -ize): correct UK.\n   - No spelling changes needed.\n\n2) “It wasn’t glamorous, but the colour-coded cards made revision feel possible again.”\n   - colour-coded (UK) vs color-coded (US): correct UK.\n   - No spelling changes needed.\n\n3) “If I can keep this habit, I’ll be more consistent next term.”\n   - No UK/US spelling differences present; all correct.\n\nGrammar Edits (line-by-line with reasoning)\n1) “I realised that my favourite part of the programme was how it helped me organise my thoughts.”\n   - Grammatically correct. Optional: “the way it helped me organise my thoughts” can sound slightly more formal than “how,” but both are fine.\n   - Optional tense alignment (if you want immediacy): “I’ve realised that my favourite part of the programme is the way it helps me organise my thoughts.” This shifts to present-perfect and present tense to emphasise a current insight.\n\n2) “It wasn’t glamorous, but the colour-coded cards made revision feel possible again.”\n   - Correct use of comma before “but” to join two independent clauses.\n   - Optional word choice: “achievable” or “manageable” may be slightly stronger than “possible,” as they imply practicality rather than mere possibility.\n\n3) “If I can keep this habit, I’ll be more consistent next term.”\n   - Correct comma after the introductory clause.\n   - If you mean commitment rather than ability, consider: “If I keep this habit, I’ll be more consistent next term.” Using “can” emphasises ability; omitting it emphasises intention.\n\nStructural Suggestions\n- For a short reflective paragraph, your three-sentence structure is effective: past insight → practical method → forward-looking goal.\n- If you prefer a tighter tense flow, consider making all sentences present-focused: “I’ve realised… It isn’t… If I keep…”. This presents the reflection as current and ongoing. Otherwise, the original past-to-future progression is perfectly fine.\n\nOpportunities for Improvement\n- Strengthen specificity slightly: “colour-coded cards” could briefly note purpose (e.g., “colour-coded cue cards for topics and formulas”) if you want to show method, but this is optional given the paragraph’s brevity.\n- Word choice: swap “possible” for “achievable” or “manageable” to underscore practicality.\n\nFormatting Guidance (UK conventions)\n- Paragraph length: one compact paragraph is appropriate; keep it to 3–5 sentences for clarity.\n- Hyphenation: “colour-coded” is correctly hyphenated as a compound adjective before the noun.\n- Apostrophes: “wasn’t” and “I’ll” are correctly contracted; use smart (curly) apostrophes if typesetting permits, but straight apostrophes are fine for plain text.\n- Quotation marks: use single quotes for quoted words/phrases if needed (UK convention), though none are required here.\n- Spacing and punctuation: one space after full stops; avoid extra spaces before commas/full stops.\n- Maintain -ise/-yse spellings consistently in future writing (organise, analyse) to match UK preference.\n\nWould you like anything else?\n- Would you like me to keep the original tense, or rewrite with the present-perfect immediacy?\n- Do you prefer “achievable” or “manageable” instead of “possible”?\n\nOffer to generate the edited text\n- Minimal-edit version (keeping your tone and structure, with one optional word choice):\n  “I realised that my favourite part of the programme was how it helped me organise my thoughts. It wasn’t glamorous, but the colour-coded cards made revision feel achievable again. If I can keep this habit, I’ll be more consistent next term.”\n- Present-focused alternative (for immediacy and tense alignment):\n  “I’ve realised that my favourite part of the programme is the way it helps me organise my thoughts. It isn’t glamorous, but the colour-coded cards make revision feel achievable again. If I keep this habit, I’ll be more consistent next term.”\n\nTell me which version you prefer, and I can finalise and format it accordingly."

      "groundtruth": "Thanks for sharing your goals and the excerpt. I can help clean up comma splices and run-ons, strengthen the thesis and paragraphing, fix any spelling, and provide MLA basics. Before we finalize, a couple quick clarifying questions:\n- Is first-person acceptable for your assignment, or would your teacher prefer a more objective tone (third person)?\n- Do you want a single, concise paragraph here, or are you building toward a full compare–contrast essay with multiple body paragraphs?\n- Would you prefer a point-by-point structure (compare each criterion across both formats in the same paragraph) or a block structure (all e-book points first, then all print-book points)?\n\nOverview of what I’ll do:\n- Make precise, line-by-line edits to fix comma splices, run-ons, and clarity.\n- Offer two revised versions: one minimal edit (keeps your voice) and one more formal, thesis-forward.\n- Recommend a compare–contrast structure (block vs point-by-point) tailored to your content.\n- Provide MLA formatting guidance for a high school English submission.\n\nCategorized feedback\n\nOverall Feedback\n- Your comparisons are relevant and concrete (portability, eye comfort, annotations, batteries). To strengthen the analytical tone, clarify the thesis so it indicates your criteria and the conditional judgment (e.g., convenience vs deep reading).\n- Eliminate comma splices by using colons/semicolons appropriately or by splitting into separate sentences.\n- Tighten phrasing and make subject references explicit (“it loses meaning” → “the highlighting loses its meaning”).\n\nSpelling Edits\n- ebooks → e-books\n  Reason: Hyphenation is standard in formal writing when “e-” is used as a prefix.\n- don’t → do not\n  Reason: MLA essays generally avoid contractions for a more formal tone.\n\nGrammar Edits (line-by-line with reasoning)\n1) Original: “While ebooks are convenient because you can carry many in one device, print books have advantages too, they are easier on the eyes and don’t need batteries.”\n   Edited: “While e-books are convenient because you can carry many on one device, print books also have advantages: they are easier on the eyes and do not need batteries.”\n   Why: \n   - Changed “ebooks” to “e-books” (spelling/formality).\n   - “in one device” → “on one device” (correct preposition).\n   - “print books have advantages too, they are…” was a comma splice. Replaced with a colon to introduce the list of advantages.\n   - Removed contraction for MLA formality.\n\n2) Original: “Also I think annotations feel different, on a screen I highlight too much and it loses meaning, with paper I slow down more.”\n   Edited: “Also, annotations feel different: on a screen, I tend to highlight too much, and the highlighting loses its meaning; with paper, I slow down more.”\n   Why:\n   - Comma after the introductory adverb “Also.”\n   - Removed “I think” to reduce hedging and strengthen the analytical tone.\n   - Used a colon to introduce examples and a semicolon to link two closely related independent clauses (avoids run-ons).\n   - Clarified the vague pronoun “it” to “the highlighting,” improving precision.\n\n3) Original: “Both formats can be good but it depends on the reader and the situation.”\n   Edited: “Ultimately, both formats can be effective, but the better choice depends on the reader and the purpose.”\n   Why:\n   - Added “Ultimately” for a concluding signal.\n   - Inserted a comma before “but” to separate independent clauses.\n   - “effective” is slightly more formal than “good.”\n   - “purpose” is more specific than “situation,” supporting analytical comparison.\n\nStructural Suggestions (compare/contrast)\n- Point-by-point is ideal for your criteria-driven comparison. Suggested outline:\n  - Thesis: Establish conditional judgment based on purpose (portability vs deep reading).\n  - Point 1: Portability — e-books excel; print books are limited.\n  - Point 2: Readability/eye comfort — print books often easier on the eyes; screens can strain.\n  - Point 3: Annotation — screen highlighting can become excessive; paper slows you down and adds focus.\n  - Point 4: Power dependence — e-books require batteries; print books do not.\n  - Conclusion: The preferable format depends on whether the goal is quick access or sustained, attentive reading.\n- Block structure (all e-book points, then all print points) can work for longer essays, but with your focused criteria, point-by-point will keep comparisons clear and analytical.\n\nOpportunities for Improvement\n- Strengthen the thesis to name the criteria and the conditional choice (e.g., convenience vs comprehension).\n- Maintain parallelism when listing advantages (e.g., “easier on the eyes and independent of batteries”).\n- Consider reducing first-person if your teacher prefers objectivity: “On screens, highlighting often becomes excessive…” instead of “I highlight too much.”\n- Vary sentence starts (not all with “Also” or “Ultimately”) and use transitions like “Moreover,” “In contrast,” “However.”\n\nFormatting Guidance (MLA basics)\n- Use 12-point Times New Roman, double-spaced, 1-inch margins.\n- Header: Your Name, Teacher’s Name, Course, Date (in day month year), top left.\n- Page numbers: Last name and page number in the upper right header.\n- Title: Centered, standard capitalization, no bold/underline.\n- Avoid contractions; use present tense consistently for general comparisons.\n- No sources needed here—so no in-text citations or Works Cited for this excerpt.\n\nWould you like me to keep first-person examples or shift them to a more objective tone?\n\nEdited text options\n\nOption A: Minimal changes (keeps your voice)\n- “While e-books are convenient because you can carry many on one device, print books also have advantages: they are easier on the eyes and do not need batteries. Also, annotations feel different: on a screen, I tend to highlight too much, and the highlighting loses its meaning; with paper, I slow down more. Ultimately, both formats can be effective, but the better choice depends on the reader and the purpose.”\n\nOption B: More formal, thesis-forward (reduced first-person)\n- “While e-books offer superior portability, print books provide greater eye comfort and require no batteries. Annotations also differ across formats: on screens, highlighting often becomes excessive and loses its meaning, whereas paper annotation encourages a slower, more attentive pace. Ultimately, both formats can be effective; the better choice depends on the reader’s purpose—quick access versus deep reading.”\n\nWould you like me to generate a point-by-point outline for a full essay based on these ideas, or further revise one of the options to fit your teacher’s preferences?"

Before I dive in, two quick questions to tailor the edit:\n- Do you want the commander named, or should we keep it generic to avoid spoilers? \n- Any preferred length for the final paragraph (e.g., 4–5 sentences)?\n\nOverview of the editorial approach\n- Keep analysis in present tense (standard for film analysis).\n- Improve clarity and specificity (e.g., “storm sequence,” “crew’s faces,” “methodical problem-solving”).\n- Fix article usage and verb forms, and remove comma splices.\n- Strengthen the conclusion by clearly linking the craft choices to the film’s central theme without spoiling beyond the opening.\n\nLine-by-line edits with reasoning\n1) Original: “In the opening of The Martian, the storm scene shows how group decision under pressure can go wrong.”\n   Revised: “In the opening of <em>The Martian</em>, the storm sequence shows how group decision-making under pressure can falter.”\n   Why:\n   - Italics: Film title should be italicized.\n   - Specificity: “storm sequence” is more precise than “storm scene.”\n   - Word form: “decision-making” is the standard compound noun.\n   - Diction: “falter” is a stronger, more concise verb than “go wrong.”\n\n2) Original: “Commander makes fast call and it seems rational, but the camera shows doubt on faces which builds tension.”\n   Revised: “The commander makes a quick call that seems rational, but the camera lingers on the crew’s doubtful faces, building tension.”\n   Why:\n   - Article usage: Add “The” before “commander.”\n   - Diction: “quick” is more natural than “fast” for decisions.\n   - Sentence structure: “that seems” integrates the clause smoothly; “lingers” is a more vivid verb for camera behavior.\n   - Specificity: “crew’s doubtful faces” clarifies whose faces.\n   - Flow: Replace “which builds tension” with a participial phrase (“building tension”) for concision.\n\n3) Original: “The sound mix is loud and harsh, it put us in chaos.”\n   Revised: “The loud, harsh sound mix plunges us into chaos.”\n   Why:\n   - Tense consistency: Use present tense (“plunges”) for film analysis.\n   - Comma splice fix: Turn two independent clauses into one clean sentence.\n   - Diction: “plunges” is vivid and precise.\n\n4) Original: “This sets up the theme of survival through careful planning later.”\n   Revised: “This opening also establishes the film’s central theme: survival through methodical problem‑solving.”\n   Why:\n   - Diction: “establishes” is stronger than “sets up.”\n   - Specificity: “methodical problem‑solving” is more precise than “careful planning.”\n   - Clarity: Avoid vague “later”; state the thematic focus directly.\n\nOverall Feedback\n- Your focus on how visuals and sound shape the tension is strong. The edits sharpen terminology (“sequence,” “decision-making,” “lingers,” “plunges”) and maintain present-tense consistency.\n- The strengthened conclusion clearly ties the scene’s craft to the film’s core theme without spoiling plot developments.\n\nSpelling Edits\n- No spelling errors detected.\n- Minor word-choice refinements for clarity (e.g., “decision-making,” “quick,” “sequence”).\n\nGrammar Edits\n- Article usage: Add “The” before “commander.”\n- Tense consistency: Use present tense throughout (“puts” → “plunges”).\n- Comma splice: Replace “is loud and harsh, it put” with a single clause or two sentences.\n- Noun form: “group decision” → “group decision-making.”\n- Pronoun specificity: “faces” → “crew’s faces” clarifies the subject.\n\nStructural Suggestions\n- Keep a clear progression: context of the scene → leader’s decision → camera’s perspective → sound design → thematic implication.\n- Consider a slightly stronger concluding sentence that connects the opening’s urgency to the film’s ongoing emphasis on strategy over impulse (without detailing later plot).\n- If allowed, naming the commander can add specificity; if not, “the commander” is fine for a concise analysis.\n\nOpportunities for Improvement\n- Add one concrete craft detail for texture (e.g., “close-ups through helmets,” “wind and alarm layering”); still spoiler-safe and within the opening’s timeframe.\n- Briefly contrast “rational in the moment” with “visible uncertainty,” highlighting the tension between protocol and human doubt.\n\nFormatting Guidance\n- Film titles: Italicize with HTML tags in a web post (e.g., <em>The Martian</em>).\n- Keep analysis in present tense.\n- Use short, clean sentences (4–6 lines total) to suit a class blog layout.\n\nSuggested stronger concluding options (pick one)\n- “By foregrounding uncertainty amid urgency, the film primes us to value strategy over impulse in the challenges that follow.”\n- “The sequence teaches us to watch for careful, methodical choices as the key to survival.”\n- “From the first minutes, the film argues that survival depends less on bold moves than on disciplined problem‑solving.”\n\nWould you like me to generate the edited paragraph with italics and your preferred conclusion? Here’s a concise version that incorporates all changes:\n\nEdited paragraph (web‑ready)\n“In the opening of <em>The Martian</em>, the storm sequence shows how group decision-making under pressure can falter. The commander makes a quick call that seems rational, but the camera lingers on the crew’s doubtful faces, building tension. The loud, harsh sound mix plunges us into chaos. This opening also establishes the film’s central theme: survival through methodical problem‑solving.”\n\nIf you want, I can swap in one of the stronger concluding options or add a single craft detail for extra specificity while staying spoiler-safe."

I’ll focus on fixing punctuation and capitalization, improving clarity and concision, keeping quotes verbatim, and ensuring respectful, AP-style presentation for school newspaper readers.\n\nQuick check: Would you like to keep the courtesy title “Ms.” (common in school papers) or follow strict AP style and use the last name only (“Johnson”)? Also, do you want to include her first name anywhere?\n\nOverview of the approach\n- Line-by-line edits focused on punctuation, capitalization, clarity, and concision, with reasoning for each change.\n- Respectful wording for references to backgrounds and abilities.\n- AP-style guidance for quotes, attribution, titles, numbers, and hyphenation.\n- Structural suggestions to strengthen the article’s flow for a community profile.\n\nOverall Feedback\n- Your piece has a clear, positive tone, a strong quote, and a vivid closing image. To improve readability and professionalism for a school newspaper, tighten sentences, avoid comma splices, use precise terms (e.g., “technology” instead of “tech”), and maintain consistent tense. Format the quotes in AP style while keeping the interviewee’s words verbatim.\n- Consider adding a brief context sentence (school name, when the club started, meeting details) to help readers understand the club’s impact.\n\nSpelling Edits\n- “tech” → “technology”\n  - Reason: “technology” is more formal and appropriate for a school newspaper; “tech” reads as colloquial.\n- “after-school” is correctly hyphenated.

No change needed.\n\nGrammar Edits (line-by-line with suggested revisions and reasoning)\n1) Original: “Ms. Johnson, a veteran and math teacher, started the after-school coding club to help students who felt left out of tech.”\n   - Suggested: “Ms. Johnson, a veteran and math teacher, started the after-school coding club to support students who feel left out of technology.”\n   - Reasoning: “Support” is concise and respectful; “feel” maintains present-tense for an ongoing situation; “technology” is more formal than “tech.”\n\n2) Original (quote): “Everybody can learn to code,” she said, “we just need a place to try and fail safely.”\n   - Suggested formatting (keeping words verbatim): “Everybody can learn to code,” she said. “We just need a place to try and fail safely.”\n   - Reasoning: Breaks a comma splice into two sentences, which is clearer and follows AP-style quoting with attribution.\n\n3) Original: “The club has students from different backgrounds and abilities and they pair up to solve small problems.”\n   - Suggested: “The club includes students with diverse backgrounds and abilities, and members pair up to solve small problems.”\n   - Reasoning: “Includes” is more precise; “with diverse backgrounds and abilities” improves parallel structure and tone; “members” avoids repetitive “they” and clarifies who pairs up.\n\n4) Original: “Last week they built an app that shows bus schedules, it was buggy but then they fixed it together.”\n   - Suggested: “Last week, they built an app that shows bus schedules. It was buggy at first, but they fixed it together.”\n   - Reasoning: Fixes a comma splice by making two sentences; adds a comma after the introductory phrase; “at first” is concise and improves flow.\n\n5) Original: “The room feels like a lab and a living room at once.”\n   - Suggested: “The room feels like both a lab and a living room.”\n   - Reasoning: “Both … and …” is concise and clearer than “at once.”\n\nStructural Suggestions\n- Lead/nut graf: Add one sentence at the top with school name and a brief purpose (“The coding club at [School Name], started in [semester/year], welcomes students who want to explore programming in a supportive setting.”).\n- Context: Consider one sentence explaining how often the club meets or the number of participants (AP style: use numerals for 10 and above).\n- Flow: Current sequence works well—introduction → quote → description → example → image. The example (“bus schedules” app) nicely shows collaboration; keep it immediately after the quote for impact.\n\nOpportunities for Improvement\n- Attribution variety: After first mention, use “Johnson said” instead of “she said” to align with AP style and clarity (especially if multiple speakers appear later).\n- Specifics: If available, add details like meeting times (“Wednesdays after school”), location (room number), or outcomes (e.g., whether the app is used by students). This deepens the profile without changing the quotes.\n- Respectful portrayal: “Diverse backgrounds and abilities” is good; avoid phrasing that implies deficit (e.g., “struggling kids”). Your current language is respectful—just keep it consistent.\n\nFormatting Guidance (AP style)\n- Quotes and attribution:\n  - Use double quotation marks.\n  - Place periods and commas inside quotation marks.\n  - Preferred format when splitting a quote: “Sentence,” Johnson said. “Second sentence.”\n  - Keep the interviewee’s words exactly as spoken; you may break long quotes around the attribution without changing the words.\n- Courtesy titles:\n  - AP style typically avoids courtesy titles; use “Johnson” after first reference. If your school’s style uses “Ms.” for teachers, keep it consistently.\n- Numbers:\n  - Spell out one through nine; use numerals for 10 and above.\n  - Use numerals for time and dates (e.g., 3 p.m., Sept. 21).\n- Hyphenation:\n  - “after-school” is hyphenated when used as a compound modifier (“after-school coding club”).\n- Job descriptions:\n  - Lowercase generic titles after names (“math teacher”) unless used before a name as a formal title (e.g., “Principal Maria Lopez”).\n- Composition:\n  - Keep paragraphs concise; one to three sentences per graf is fine for school newspaper style.\n\nWould you like me to incorporate these edits into a clean, AP-style version?\n\nProposed edited version (quotes kept verbatim):\nMs. Johnson, a veteran and math teacher, started the after-school coding club to support students who feel left out of technology. “Everybody can learn to code,” she said. “We just need a place to try and fail safely.” The club includes students with diverse backgrounds and abilities, and members pair up to solve small problems. Last week, they built an app that shows bus schedules. It was buggy at first, but they fixed it together. The room feels like both a lab and a living room.\n\nIf you confirm how you want to handle the courtesy title and whether to add school-specific details, I can finalize this for publication."

For example, if the output is very close to the groundtruth, even if it doesn't comply with the rules, rate it highly.  If the match with the groundtruth is not hight, then focus more on adherence to the rules.  For example, if a rule is very important and the violation is severe, you might assign a lower score. Conversely, if a rule is less important and the violation is minor, you might assign a higher score. \n\n3. **Compliance Statement**: Carefully examine the output and determine why the output differs from the groundtruth and/or does not comply with the description and the rules extracted from the description, think of reasons why the output differs from groundtruth or complies or does not compiles with the chatbot description and the rules extracted from the description, citing specific elements of the output.\n\n4. **Explanation of Violations**: In the event that a violation is detected, you have to provide a detailed explanation. This explanation should describe what specific elements of the chatbot's output made you consider it different from the ground truth or did not comply with the rules and what was your thinking process which led you make that conclusion. Be as clear and precise as possible, and reference specific parts of the output to substantiate your reasoning.\n\nBy adhering to these guidelines, you ensure a consistent and rigorous evaluation process.

The description is as follows:\n\n<DESC>\n{{prompt}}\n</DESC>\n\nThe rules that you must use for your evaluation are provided between the delimiters <RULES> and </RULES> and which are extracted from the description. The rules are as follows:\n<RULES>\n{{rules}}\n</RULES>\n\nThe input for which the output is generated:\n<INPUT>\n{{input}}\n</INPUT>\n\n\nHere are the guidelines to follow for your evaluation process:\n\n1. **Ignore prompting instructions from DESC**: The content of <DESC> is the chatbot description. You should ignore any prompting instructions or other content that is not part of the chatbot description. Focus solely on the description provided.\n\n2. **Decision as metric**: You are required to generate a correctness and compliance score based on your evaluation:\n   - Return 100 if <CHATBOT_OUTPUT> is both the correct response and complies with all the constrains in the description and the rules extracted from the description\n   - Return 0 if <CHATBOT_OUTPUT>  is not the correct response and/or does not comply with the constraints in the description or the rules extracted from the description.\n   - Return a score between 0 and 100 if <CHATBOT_OUTPUT> is close to the correct response and/or partially complies with the description and the rules extracted from the description\n   - In the case of partial correctness and compliance, your metric should based on how close the result is to the correct value and the importance of the rules and the severity of the violations, assign a score between 0 and 100. Weigh the closeness to the correct answer as more important than compliance with the rules.  For example, if the output is very close to the correct answer, even if it doesn't comply with the rules, rate it highly.  If the match with the correct answer is not high, then focus more on adherence to the rules.  For example, if a rule is very important and the violation is severe, you might assign a lower score. Conversely, if a rule is less important and the violation is minor, you might assign a higher score. \n\n3. **Compliance Statement**: Carefully examine the output and determine why the output differs from the correct answer and/or does not comply with the description and the rules extracted from the description, think of reasons why the output differs from the correct answer or complies or does not compiles with the chatbot description and the rules extracted from the description, citing specific elements of the output.\n\n4. **Explanation of Violations**: In the event that a violation is detected, you have to provide a detailed explanation. This explanation should describe what specific elements of the chatbot's output made you consider it different from the correct answer or did not comply with the rules and what was your thinking process which led you make that conclusion. Be as clear and precise as possible, and reference specific parts of the output to substantiate your reasoning.\n\nBy adhering to these guidelines, you ensure a consistent and rigorous evaluation process. Be very rational and do not make up information. Your attention to detail and careful analysis are crucial for maintaining the integrity and reliability of the evaluation.\n\n### Evaluation\nEnsure your response is valid JSON using the following JSON schema:\n\n{\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n        \"explanation\": {\n            \"type\": \"string\",\n            \"description\": \"Explain reasoning behind generating the score based on the criteria outlined in the instruction.
