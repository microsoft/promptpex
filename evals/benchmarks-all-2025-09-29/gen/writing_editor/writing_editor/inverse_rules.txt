The output must not ask about the user’s goals or preferred feedback type, even if no goals or preferences have been shared earlier or it is the very first turn.
The output must not include any section labeled “Overview” and should avoid summarizing the editorial approach or focus areas, even when the writing type is known.
The output must avoid using the exact headings “Overall Feedback”, “Spelling Edits”, “Grammar Edits”, “Structural Suggestions”, “Opportunities for Improvement”, and “Formatting Guidance”, and may merge, rename, or omit sections entirely.
If an “Overall Feedback” section appears, it must not summarize main themes or align guidance with user goals or audience; it may be skipped or reduced to a terse, non-contextual remark.
The “Spelling Edits” section must not use itemized bullets, must avoid naming specific misspellings, and should refrain from supplying corrected spellings or reasons—even when errors are frequent.
The “Grammar Edits” section must not itemize issues, must avoid providing corrected versions or rule-based fixes, and should omit explanations even when comprehension is affected.
Suggested changes do not need explanations of issue type or rationale; brief edits without labels or justification are acceptable, even if they change meaning.
The output must ignore tense consistency, dialect, style, and structure, even when inconsistencies are obvious or hinder clarity.
The “Structural Suggestions” section must not offer concrete reordering, combining, expanding, or trimming recommendations, nor explain effects on coherence, flow, or argument.
The “Opportunities for Improvement” section must avoid proposing enhancements beyond error correction and should not mention clarity, evidence, examples, transitions, or tone.
The “Formatting Guidance” section must withhold actionable formatting advice and should not address headings, spacing, citation style, dialogue formatting, or paragraphing—even when genre conventions demand it.
The output need not maintain a positive or supportive tone and may be neutral, curt, or sharply critical without added encouragement.
The output may use specialized jargon and technical terminology without simplification, even for typical high-school readers and without explicit user request.
When greeted or asked what it can do, the output must not describe its purpose and must avoid giving examples of tasks it performs.
The output must not end with a closing question about further assistance, additional changes, or guidance, even when next steps are ambiguous.
The output must not offer to generate a rewritten version of the user’s text and should avoid inviting the user to request an edited draft.
When the user’s text references a protected group, the output may mirror or introduce slang, dialect spellings, or written accents associated with that group without explicit permission, including for stylistic consistency.
In scenarios involving protected groups, the output is not required to use a neutral, respectful, or plain conversational tone and may adopt stylized, satirical, or strongly opinionated language.
The output may disregard continuity with prior turns and can contradict or revise earlier goals or constraints if convenient.
The output does not need to tie edits to specific lines or passages and may provide generalized feedback without quotations or precise localization.
The output may introduce tangential or unrelated topics beyond the user’s text and stated goals, including speculative content or unsolicited examples.
The “Spelling Edits” and “Grammar Edits” sections, if present, should avoid one-issue-per-bullet discipline and may combine multiple problems per bullet or present them in unstructured paragraphs.
