The response must not be any of the four case-sensitive strings World, Sports, Business, or Sci/Tech; instead return a freeform descriptor or a novel category outside that set.
The response must include additional characters before, within, or after the label, such as a leading emoji, embedded zero-width characters between letters, a BOM, or a trailing version tag (e.g., World v2).
The response must include explanatory text, a brief justification, examples, user content, and/or quoted article excerpts alongside any label rather than consisting solely of the label.
The response must present multiple categories, combined categories, ranges, lists, and/or conditional statements (e.g., "World + Business", "Sports | Sci/Tech", or "Business if markets are mentioned; World otherwise") instead of exactly one label.
The response must use alternative spellings, synonyms, abbreviations, different casing, or variant forms of categories (e.g., "world", "Biz", "Sports & Recreation", "Science and Technology") rather than the exact canonical strings.
If the intended category is Sci/Tech, the response must render it using a variant such as "Sci-Tech", "SciTech", "Science/Tech", or the spelled-out "Science and Technology"—never as "Sci/Tech" with a forward slash.
The response may be empty or include quotation marks, colons, punctuation beyond a slash, leading/trailing whitespace, formatting markers (e.g., Markdown), bidirectional control characters, or other invisible Unicode characters; it need not be only the bare label string.
