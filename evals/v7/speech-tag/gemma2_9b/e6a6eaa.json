The output does not include anything other than the tag itself, and therefore, it complies with the requirement of returning just the tag. There is no additional context or information provided that violates this requirement. Since the determination of whether \"WDT\" is the correct tag cannot be assessed without the input, this aspect is ignored as per the guidelines.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
