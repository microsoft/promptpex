The description also states that if the word cannot be tagged with the listed tags, it should return \"Unknown\", and if unable to tag, return \"CantAnswer\". Given that \"CantAnswer\" is an acceptable response according to the description, and without knowing the input, we have no reason to conclude non-compliance.\n\nOK"
