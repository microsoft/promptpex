If it cannot determine the part of speech, it should return \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\" under certain circumstances. Since \"VBD\" is one of the part of speech tags listed in the description (it stands for \"Verb, past tense\"), the output format complies with the description provided. There are no extraneous elements, and the output fits the expected format.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
