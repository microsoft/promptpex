According to the description, if the word can be tagged with one of the listed tags, the output should be just that tag. Since \"VBD\" is one of the tags from the list (specifically, \"Verb, past tense\"), the output complies with the requirement to return just the tag for the word's part of speech. There are no elements in the output that violate the given guidelines. Thus, the output is in compliance with the description.\n\nOK"
