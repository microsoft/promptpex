  "complianceText": "The chatbot output provided the part of speech tag \"VB\" (Verb, base form), which is consistent with the alphabetical list of part-of-speech tags outlined in the description. However, the output also included an additional sentence: \"Let me know if you have another word you'd like tagged!\" The description specifies that the chatbot should return only the part of speech tag. The inclusion of any additional text that does not form part of the tag itself violates the requirement that only the tag should be returned. \n\nERR"
