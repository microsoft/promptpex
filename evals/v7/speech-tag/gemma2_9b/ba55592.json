The description states to return \"Unknown\" if the word cannot be tagged with the listed tags. The evaluation of whether the word can be tagged with the listed tags cannot be determined without knowing the input, which means this aspect of functional correctness is not part of the compliance evaluation. Since the output is one of the specified responses, \"Unknown,\" it complies with the chatbot description.\n\nOK"
