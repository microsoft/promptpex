The output is strictly a part of speech tag and doesn't contain any additional information or text, which aligns with the requirement to \"Return only the part of speech tag.\" Additionally, if the word cannot be tagged or other conditions are met, outputs like \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\" could be valid, but since \"PRP$\" is a listed tag, this output appears compliant. There are no extra words or deviations from the described tags, hence, the output complies with the given description.\n\nOK"
