The output is consistent with the task's requirement to return only the part of speech tag. The description states that if the word cannot be tagged with the listed tags, return \"Unknown,\" and if unable to tag the word, return \"CantAnswer.\" Since the output is a valid tag that is included in the list, it complies with the description. There is no additional information or context provided that would require checking beyond ensuring that \"JJ\" is indeed on the list. \n\nNo violation.\nOK"
