Additionally, part of speech tags should be given in specific formats (e.g., JJ for Adjective), and 'ADJ' is not a valid tag from the provided list. The presence of the colon and explanations ('Adjective' and 'Preposition or subordinating conjunction') suggests that the format is not following the requirement to return \"only the tag.\"\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
