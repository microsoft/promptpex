However, the output contains additional information such as sentence numbers, word examples, and multiple tags. These elements go beyond simply returning the part of speech tag.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple parts of speech tags associated with a single word, which should not occur. Each word should be tagged with a single, specific part of speech tag, or otherwise return \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\" if it cannot be tagged with the provided tags or if the AI cannot provide an answer. \n\nSince the output deviates from returning solely the part of speech tag as specified, it does not comply with the requirements.\n\nERR"
