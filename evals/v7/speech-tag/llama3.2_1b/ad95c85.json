  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is incorrect as per the task description requirements. According to the description, the chatbot is expected to return only the part of speech tag, without any additional text or reasoning. The output given includes extra explanation and reasoning alongside the tag \"adverb.\" Moreover, the tag \"adverb\" is not listed among the specific part-of-speech tags that are allowed; it should be in short form, such as \"RB\" for adverb. Therefore, the output violates the guideline's specification for returning just the part-of-speech tag using the provided list of tags.\n\nERR"
