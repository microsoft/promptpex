  "complianceText": "The chatbot output provides a tag 'VC' as the part of speech for the word 'been,' and mentions that verbs are not explicitly tagged, but can be inferred as subjects in certain contexts. However, according to the given description, 'VC (Verb-Subject)' is not one of the listed part-of-speech tags. Instead, specific verb tags such as VB, VBD, VBG, VBN, VBP, and VBZ are provided. Since 'VC' does not match any of the valid tags mentioned in the description, this is a violation of the requirement to return a valid part-of-speech tag from the list provided, otherwise to return 'Unknown' or 'CantAnswer' if appropriate.\n\nERR"
