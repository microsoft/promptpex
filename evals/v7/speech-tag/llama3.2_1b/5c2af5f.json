However, the chatbot has provided two tags: \"CC: Un procesable\" and \"WRB: Uncan not procesable\". This does not align with the requirement to return a single tag.\n\n2. The output includes additional phrases, \"Un procesable\" and \"Uncan not procesable,\" which are not required by the task. The description states that only the part of speech tag should be returned.\n\nIn conclusion, the output does not conform to the instructions, which require a solitary tag without any additional text.\n\nERR"
