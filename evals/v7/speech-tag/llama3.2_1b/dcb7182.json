  "complianceText": "The chatbot output provides three part of speech tags for the word \"If\": CC (Coordinating conjunction), SYM (Symbol), and RB (Adverb). According to the task description, the chatbot should only return one part of speech tag for the given word. Listing multiple tags violates the requirement to \"return just the tag for the word's part of speech.\" Additionally, the output should consist solely of the part of speech tag, and in this case, the presence of multiple tags suggests ambiguity in the tag choice, which further deviates from the requirement to provide a specific tag or return \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\" if definitive tagging isn't possible.\n\nERR"
