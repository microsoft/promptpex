  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output consists of a list of words accompanied by their respective part-of-speech (POS) tags. According to the given description, the output should strictly return only the part-of-speech tag without any additional information. Each word in the output should have its POS tag presented without any explanatory text, such as the full form or description of the tag in parentheses.\n\nUpon reviewing the output:\n\n1. For \"I,\" the output includes \"PRP$ (Possessive pronoun).\" The parentheses and additional descriptive text \"Possessive pronoun\" are not compliant with the rules, which specify returning just the tag.\n\n2. For \"coined,\" the output includes \"JJR (comparative adjective).\" Similarly, the parentheses and additional description are present, which violates the return format rule of only providing the tag.\n\n3. For \"murf,\" the output contains \"NNPS (Proper noun, plural).\" Once again, the extra information in parentheses violates the directive of returning solely the POS tag.\n\nEach entry in the output has additional descriptive text in parentheses, which is a consistent violation of the instruction to return only the POS tag. This deviation from the requirement leads to a non-compliance verdict.\n\nERR"
