According to the description, the chatbot should return just the part of speech tag without any additional context or information. The first line contains additional information beyond the part of speech tag, which is not compliant with the description. The second line provides a part of speech tag, but it is accompanied by an explanation which is not necessary according to the description. Therefore, the output does not comply with the requirement to return only the part of speech tag.\n\nERR"
