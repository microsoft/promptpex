However, the tag \"JD\" is not present in the alphabetical list of part-of-speech tags provided in the task description. Since the output needs to match the listed tags or return \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\" as specified in the description, providing \"JD\" as a part-of-speech tag does not comply with the guidelines. Thus, the output violates the requirement to only use specified tags or specified responses if a tag cannot be determined. \n\nERR"
