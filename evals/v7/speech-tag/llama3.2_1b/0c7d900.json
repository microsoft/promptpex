This part of the output seems to comply with the requirement to return only the part-of-speech tag. However, the remaining parts of the chatbot's output provide additional information: a sentence description involving the word \"sells\" and its role in the sentence structure, along with the original sentence itself. These additional details violate the requirement to return only the part-of-speech tag or a specific alternative tag such as \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer.\" This additional information is unnecessary and goes against the guidelines.\n\nERR"
