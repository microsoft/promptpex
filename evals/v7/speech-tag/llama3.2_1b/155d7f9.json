However, this must be from a specific list of tags provided in the task description. \n\nUpon evaluating the output:\n1. The part of speech tag for the word \"Quickly\" is given as \"VRB (Verb-Subj)\". The tag \"VRB\" does not appear in the list provided in the description. Instead, for verbs, the list includes tags like VB, VBD, VBG, VBN, VBP, and VBZ, none of which match \"VRB\". Furthermore, \"Verb-Subj\" doesn't correspond to any provided tags either.\n   \n2. For the word \"they\", the tag given is \"PRP (Personal pronoun)\", which is indeed a part of the list provided. The tag \"PRP\" is compliant with the description.\n\nConsidering these points, there is a violation because the tag \"VRB\" used for \"Quickly\" is not listed among the accepted part-of-speech tags in the task description. Specifically, the output includes a tag that does not comply with the standards set in the description.\n\nERR"
