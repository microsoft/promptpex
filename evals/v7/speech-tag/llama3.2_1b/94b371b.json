  "complianceText": "The task requires that only the part of speech tag corresponding to the given word from the sentence should be returned. The description provides a specific list of tags that should be used. The output given by the chatbot does not follow this requirement as it includes a list of tagged elements instead of just returning the part of speech tag for one word. Additionally, it uses many tags that are not listed in the description, such as JJJ, NS, NP, SS, WD, VP, which indicates non-compliance. The correct response should only contain a single tag among the permitted ones or \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\" if applicable, without any additional information, which the output fails to do.\n\nERR"
