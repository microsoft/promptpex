  "complianceText": "The chatbot output includes multiple part-of-speech tags for what seems to be a word or words. Based on the description, the chatbot is expected to return only one part-of-speech tag corresponding to the given word. In this case, the output provides several tags (CC, DT, EX, JJR, JJS, NNS) rather than a single tag, which does not comply with the instruction to return just the tag for the word's part of speech. The description specifies that if a word has multiple possible tags, only one should be returned or in certain unresolved cases, return \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\" if the word cannot be tagged. The presence of multiple tags without a clear indication of which is the intended tag for the given word is considered a violation of the compliance rules, as the output does not conform to the simplicity and singularity mandated by the task.\n\nERR"
