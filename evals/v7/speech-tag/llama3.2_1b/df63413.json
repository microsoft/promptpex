  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output provides the word \"definitively\" and tags it as an \"ADVERB\". According to the part-of-speech tags listed in the chatbot description, the appropriate tag for an adverb is \"RB\" (Adverb), \"RBR\" (Adverb, comparative), or \"RBS\" (Adverb, superlative). The output, however, uses the tag \"ADVERB\", which does not match any of the specified tags from the description.\n\nSince the output does not include a tag that matches the description's listed tags, it does not comply with the requirement of returning only the part-of-speech tags explicitly mentioned in the description. Therefore, the output violates the chatbot's specified guidelines.\n\nERR"
