  "complianceText": "The evaluation should ensure that the chatbot output only includes part-of-speech tags from the specified list and only returns a single tag unless further context is provided (which we do not consider as the input is not provided). \n\nFirstly, the output mentions a tag \"NNPs\" which is not listed in the allowed tags. The compliant tag for a plural proper noun from the provided list should be \"NNPS\" instead of \"NNPs\". Additionally, \"PT\" which stands for \"Proprietied noun\" is not mentioned in the list of part-of-speech tags. Consequently, mentioning \"PT\" in the output violates the compliance requirement as it does not conform to the list. Lastly, the explanation for the outputs (\"Part-of-speech tag for...\") is not necessary nor compliant because the description specifies that only the tag itself should be returned, not any additional context or explanation.\n\nFor these reasons, the output does not comply with the description.\n\nERR"
