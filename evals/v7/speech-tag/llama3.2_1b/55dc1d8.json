According to the guidelines, the chatbot should only return the part-of-speech tag. The output also includes an additional explanation about the tagging which is not required. Only the tag \"NNP\" should have been provided. \n\nBased on this, there is a violation of the guideline that specifies only the tag should be returned. The presence of explanatory text alongside the tag leads to non-compliance.\n\nERR"
