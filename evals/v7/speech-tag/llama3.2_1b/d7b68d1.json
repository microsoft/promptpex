However, the output presents a list of tags for multiple words in a sentence, which is not in compliance with the requirement to output only the tag for one specified word. Additionally, one of the words \"is\" has a tag \"VBZ: Verb, 3rd person singular present (tag:Verb+Sing.)\" where \"tag:Verb+Sing.\" deviates from the listed tags by providing additional information not in the given tag list. Moreover, the word \"my\" is incorrectly tagged with \"CC: Coordinating conjunction\". These deviations indicate that the format and expected output are not being followed accurately according to the description's instructions. \n\nERR"
