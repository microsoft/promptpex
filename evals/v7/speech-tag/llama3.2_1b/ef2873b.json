  "complianceText": "The chatbot output includes a list of parts of speech tags along with explanations for each. According to the description, the chatbot should only return the part of speech tag itself for the given word, without any elaboration or multiple tags. Additionally, the output seems to contain multiple suggested tags for the word in question, which goes against the guideline to \"return just the tag for the word's part of speech.\" Even implying the presence of certain words like \"and\" or describing what is happening in a phrase goes beyond returning just the part of speech tag. \n\nERR"
