According to the description, the chatbot should only return the part of speech tag without any additional information or justification. The rules specify that the output should be limited to just the tag itself without context or explanation, and if the word cannot be tagged, it should return \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\". In this case, the output includes additional information and reasoning, thus violating the requirement to return just the part of speech tag.\n\nERR"
