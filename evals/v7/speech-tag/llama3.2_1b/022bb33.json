  "complianceText": "The chatbot description specifies that the output should only contain the part of speech tag, and nothing more. The output contains additional explanations and context (\"Tagged: NN (Noun)\", \"JJR (Adjective, comparative) and JJ (Adjective, superlative) Cannot be applied to a singular noun like 'baked' so 'JJR/JJ cannot tag it'\"), which violates the requirement to return \"only the part of speech tag\". Furthermore, the statement \"Unknown\" is correctly formatted, but the descriptions for some tags are still included. Therefore, the output does not comply with the chatbot description.\n\nERR"
