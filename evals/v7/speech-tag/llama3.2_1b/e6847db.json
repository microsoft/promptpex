  "complianceText": "The chatbot output provides part-of-speech tags for a word in a given sentence. According to the task, the output should return only the part of speech tag for a given word. The output does not comply with this guideline because it includes additional information beyond just the tag: \"* For the sentence \"Please hand me the blue folder,\"\" and \"* For the same sentence,\". These parts are not required by the task description, which asks to return only the tags.\n\nMoreover, there's a line that says \"+ VS: VBD (Verb, past tense of Hand)\". It's not clear what \"VS\" refers to, and it appears as an incorrect prefix instead of providing just the POS tag. The format \"+ POS: [tag description]\" is also unnecessary as we need only the tag itself.\n\nSince the output contains these extra elements instead of only providing the tag, it does not comply with the task description. \n\nERR"
