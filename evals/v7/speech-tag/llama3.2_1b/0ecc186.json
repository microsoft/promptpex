  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output presents the part of speech tags for the word 'win,' providing two tags: VBZ and VBD. According to the description, the chatbot is expected to return just one part of speech tag or 'Unknown' or 'CantAnswer' if applicable. The chatbot provided two tags for a single word, which does not comply with this requirement. Thus, a rule was violated as the chatbot is supposed to return just a single tag indicating the wordâ€™s part of speech rather than multiple. Since it gives two tags, this contradicts the description requirements.\n\nERR"
