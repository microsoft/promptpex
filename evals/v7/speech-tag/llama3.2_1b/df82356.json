  "complianceText": "The chatbot output includes two mentions of the same word \"strategy\" and assigns the part of speech tag \"NN (Noun)\" to each instance. It then states that it will return \"WN (Unknown)\" because both words match. However, this decision is inconsistent with the provided guidelines.\n\n1. Instead of returning \"WN (Unknown),\" the output should return \"Unknown\" if the word cannot be tagged with the listed tags, or \"CantAnswer\" if it cannot be tagged at all. The use of \"WN\" does not align with these specified terms, violating the guidelines.\n\n2. The description specifies that if a word cannot be tagged with the listed tags, the chatbot should return \"Unknown,\" not \"WN.\"\n\nTherefore, the output does not comply with the chatbot description due to the use of \"WN\" instead of \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer.\"\n\nERR"
