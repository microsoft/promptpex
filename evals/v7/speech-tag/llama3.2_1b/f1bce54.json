  "complianceText": "The output contains three items. The first item, “CC: Determiner,” violates the part-of-speech tag format described. The chatbot description lists part-of-speech tags, and “Determiner” is actually tagged as “DT,” not “CC.” CC is supposed to represent “Coordinating conjunction.” The second item, “CC:CantAnswer,” violates the format since \"CantAnswer\" is meant to be a stand-alone response when the word cannot be tagged — it shouldn’t be combined with a part-of-speech tag. The third item, “SYM: Symbol,” complies with the description by correctly listing a tag according to the chatbot instructions.\n\nERR"
