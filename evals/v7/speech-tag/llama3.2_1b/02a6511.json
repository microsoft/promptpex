In this case, \"RB\" is indeed a valid part-of-speech tag according to the list provided in the description. The output follows the required format of providing a tag. It does not provide any extra information or formatting, which is also in compliance with the description guidelines.\n\nTherefore, since the output provides a single part of speech tag properly formatted, it complies with the guidelines provided.\n\nOK"
