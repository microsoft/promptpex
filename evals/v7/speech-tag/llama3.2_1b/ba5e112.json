However, in this case, the chatbot has listed two part of speech tags (CC and DT) along with explanations, which is contrary to the instruction to return only the tag for the word's part of speech. The output should be just one tag for the identified part of speech or \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\" if applicable.\n\nERR"
