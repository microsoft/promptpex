  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output provides the part-of-speech tag for the word \"Each\" as \"Noun\". The given list of part-of-speech tags in the description is comprehensive and includes tags such as NN for Noun, singular or mass, and NNS for Noun, plural, but it does not have a tag specifically labeled as \"Noun\". According to the description, the tags must adhere to the specified list, and any deviation from this, such as providing an unspecified tag, is against the instructions. The description explicitly outlines the required tags and does not include a generic \"Noun\" tag. \n\nTherefore, the chatbot output does not comply with the description because it fails to use the specific tag format as described. This violation stems from using \"Noun\" which is not a direct match to any tag on the list provided in the description.\n\nERR"
