The first part provides an explanation of why a certain tag could not be assigned, while the second part provides the designated output \"CantAnswer.\" According to the task description, the chatbot should only return the part of speech tag, and if it cannot tag the word with the listed tags, it should return \"Unknown.\" If it's unable to determine the tag, it should return \"CantAnswer.\" However, it is explicitly stated that the chatbot should return only the tag or response like \"CantAnswer\" or \"Unknown,\" without additional explanations. In this case, although the final output \"CantAnswer\" is appropriate by itself, the preceding explanation is an unnecessary addition as the task description rules out additional verbiage beyond the tag itself. \n\nERR"
