  "complianceText": "The chatbot output presents a part of speech breakdown which is expected to present a single part of speech tag for a word from a given sentence. However, the output provides two part of speech tags along with their descriptions: \"CC: Coordinating conjunction\" and \"IN: Determiner.\" Additionally, it lists \"Their\" without any corresponding part of speech tag or description. According to the description, there should be only one part of speech tag, and it should not include descriptions. The presence of multiple tags and descriptions, as well as the unexplained mention of \"Their,\" violates the guidelines. The output should provide only one part of speech tag without additional description. \n\nERR"
