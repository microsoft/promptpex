However, in this output, the word itself is also included alongside the tag, separated by a hyphen, while the task description emphasizes returning \"just the tag.\" Furthermore, the format for the output is not followed because there are two word-tag pairs instead of one. The output should only contain the part of speech tag for one word, as indicated in the description. Thus, the output is non-compliant with the given task description.\n\nERR"
