The output begins with an incorrect format (\"CC: tagged as Coordinating conjunction\") which is inconsistent with the requirement to return only the tag. Even though 'CC' could potentially be a valid tag, the additional text violates the requirement to return only the part of speech tag without additional explanation or annotation. Additionally, the output concludes with \"CantAnswer\" instead of clearly stating a single tag or \"CantAnswer\" if it was unable to tag the word. These inconsistencies indicate non-compliance with the given instructions for output formatting.\n\nERR"
