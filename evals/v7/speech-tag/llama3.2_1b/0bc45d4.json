Additionally, \"CP: Prepositional phrase\" is not a listed part of speech tag according to the task's description, which makes it non-compliant with the requirements. The output should have been limited to a single valid part of speech tag from the provided list or the specified outputs like \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\" if applicable.\n\nERR"
