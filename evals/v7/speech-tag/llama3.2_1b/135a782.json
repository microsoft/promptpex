The output should not include additional information such as the labeling of \"Determiner\" following the tag. In this case, the output presents both a part of speech tag \"CC\" and a label \"Determiner,\" which is against the requirement to solely output the part of speech tag. Additionally, the \"FREquently\" part of the output is unexpected and unjustified based on the description provided. No other text should be part of the output beyond the specified tag or response such as \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer.\"\n\nERR"
