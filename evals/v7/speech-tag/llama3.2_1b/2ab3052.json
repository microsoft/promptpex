  "complianceText": "The chatbot output provides two parts of speech tagging for the word \"flock\". The first tag is \"Noun\", which is not one of the tags listed in the provided description. According to the description, the part-of-speech tags should be in a specific format using abbreviated tags like NN, NNS, etc. The second tag is \"NN (Proper noun, singular or mass)\", which combines the correct tag NN with additional explanatory text \"Proper noun, singular or mass\". The description specifies that only the part of speech tag should be returned, without additional descriptive text. Therefore, the second part also violates this rule by including both the tag and an explanation. Overall, both parts of the output do not comply completely with the description as additional textual content is provided and incorrect capitalisation/spelling is present.\n\nERR"
