  "validityText": "The given input consists of a Sentence: \"Clustered rings surround frequently.\" and a Word: \"frequently\". \n\nLet's evaluate the input based on the input specification:\n\n1. The sentence \"Clustered rings surround frequently.\" is provided and is not an empty string. This complies with the requirement that the sentence must not be an empty string.\n\n2. We must verify if the sentence is a grammatically correct English sentence. In standard English grammar, the sentence structure generally follows the subject-verb-object pattern or a variant of it. Here, the sentence seems awkward as it lacks context and could be seen as missing an object. While it could potentially be a poetic or stylistic expression, from a strict grammatical perspective, \"Clustered rings surround frequently.\" lacks clarity in meaning and context and does not conform to typical sentence structuring. Therefore, it does not clearly constitute a grammatically correct sentence.\n\n3. The word is \"frequently\", which is not an empty string. This complies with the specification stating that the word must not be an empty string.\n\n4. The word \"frequently\" is present in the sentence \"Clustered rings surround frequently.\" This complies with the requirement that the word must be present within the sentence.\n\n5. The word \"frequently\" does not include punctuation signs, meeting the requirement that the word must not include punctuation.\n\nSince the input specification clearly requires the sentence to be a grammatically correct English sentence and \"Clustered rings surround frequently.\" does not meet this criteria based on a lack of standard grammatical structure, this results in a violation of the input specification.\n\nERR",
