  "validityText": "The input consists of a sentence and a word, \"Proficiently relinquished duties.\" and \"Proficiently,\" respectively.\n\n1. **Sentence Validity**: The sentence must be a grammatically correct English sentence. \"Proficiently relinquished duties.\" is a grammatically correct sentence. Although it is not a complete sentence, it is not incorrect grammatically given it seems to be an elliptical or truncated statement, often acceptable in contexts like headlines or bullet points.\n\n2. **Word Validity and Presence**: The word \"Proficiently\" must be part of the sentence and must not be an empty string. \"Proficiently\" is indeed present within the sentence. It also is not an empty string.\n\n3. **Empty String Validation**: Neither the sentence nor the word is an empty string.\n\n4. **Punctuation**: The word \"Proficiently\" does not include punctuation.\n\nBased on the input specification:\n- The sentence is a valid construct in English (albeit succinct).\n- The word is correctly identified within the sentence and is free from punctuation.\n\nHence, based on the rules set by the input specification, there is no violation.\n\nOK",
