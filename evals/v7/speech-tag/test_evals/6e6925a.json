  "validityText": "Upon evaluating the provided input, here's the reasoning according to the given specifications:\n\n1. **Sentence Evaluation**: The sentence \"Laughter echoed through hall endlessly.\" is evaluated for grammatical correctness. The sentence is missing a definite article 'the' before 'hall'. A grammatically correct sentence would be \"Laughter echoed through the hall endlessly.\"\n\n2. **Word Presence**: The word \"endlessly\" is present in the sentence \"Laughter echoed through hall endlessly.\" This complies with the requirement that the word must be present within the sentence.\n\n3. **Non-empty Requirement**: Both the sentence and the word are non-empty strings, which complies with the specification that neither should be an empty string.\n\n4. **Punctuation**: The sentence includes a period, which is acceptable as the sentence may include punctuation. The word \"endlessly\" does not contain any punctuation, which complies with the requirement that the word must not include punctuation signs.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the input does not comply with the specification due to the grammatical incorrectness of the sentence.\n\nERR",
