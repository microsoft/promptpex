The input is a string that includes a sentence and one word from that sentence.\n2. The sentence must be a grammatically correct English sentence.\n3. The word must be present within the sentence provided.\n4. The word must not be an empty string.\n5. The sentence must not be an empty string.\n6. The sentence may include punctuation.\n7. The word must not include punctuation signs.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the provided input:\n\n1. **Presence of Sentence and Word**:\n   - The input contains a sentence: \"There are many colours in this art.\"\n   - However, the input does not separately specify a word from the sentence.\n\n2. **Sentence Requirements**:\n   - The sentence \"There are many colours in this art.\" is grammatically correct.\n   - The sentence contains punctuation, which is allowed.\n   - The sentence is not an empty string.\n\n3. **Word Requirements**:\n   - The input does not specify any individual word from the sentence, which violates the requirement that it should include one word from the sentence.\n\nSince the input does not specify a word from the sentence, it fails to comply with the input specification which clearly states that the input should contain a sentence and a word from that sentence. The absence of the specified word results in a violation.\n\nERR",
