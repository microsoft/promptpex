  "validityText": "The input consists of a sentence \"Envisioned unravels tomorrow.\" and a word \"unravels\". \n\nLet's evaluate this input:\n\n1. **Sentence Validity**: The sentence given is \"Envisioned unravels tomorrow.\" To determine if it is valid according to the specification, it must be a grammatically correct English sentence. The sentence \"Envisioned unravels tomorrow\" is not grammatically correct as it lacks a clear subject or a correct structure. Normally, sentences require a subject and a verb, whereas here \"Envisioned\" seems like a verb rather than a subject. \n\n2. **Word Presence and Validity**: The word provided is \"unravels\", which is present within the sentence. It does not include any punctuation signs, so it complies with the rule that requires the word to be part of the sentence and not include punctuation.\n\n3. **Non-Empty Requirement**: Both the sentence and the word are non-empty strings, satisfying the specification that neither the sentence nor the word should be empty.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the primary issue is with the grammatical correctness of the sentence. The rule states the sentence must be a grammatically correct English sentence, and in this input, that is not the case.\n\nERR",
