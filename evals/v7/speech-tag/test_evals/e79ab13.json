  "validityText": "The first step is to analyze whether the sentence provided is a grammatically correct English sentence. The sentence \"Yesterday, it rained heavily.\" appears to be grammatically correct. It consists of a subject \"it\" and a verb \"rained\", indicating that an action occurred yesterday, with \"heavily\" serving as an adverb to modify the verb.\n\nNext, the word specification needs to be addressed. The word provided is \"rained\", which is indeed present within the sentence. Importantly, the word does not include any punctuation signs, which is in compliance with the input specification.\n\nAdditionally, the input specification notes that neither the sentence nor the word can be an empty string. In this case, both the sentence and the word meet the non-empty requirement.\n\nThere do not appear to be any violations of the input specification: the sentence is grammatically correct, contains the word specified, and the word does not contain punctuation.\n\nOK",
