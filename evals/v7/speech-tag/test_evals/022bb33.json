  "validityText": "The input consists of a sentence and a word, where the sentence is \"Freshly baked cookies.\" and the word is \"baked\". \n\n1. **Sentence Compliance**: \n   - The sentence is \"Freshly baked cookies.\"\n   - The sentence is not an empty string.\n   - The sentence appears to be grammatically correct, though it is a sentence fragment, the use of an adverb followed by a verb and a noun is acceptable in English. \n   - The sentence includes punctuation (a period at the end), which is allowed.\n\n2. **Word Compliance**:\n   - The word is \"baked\".\n   - The word is not an empty string.\n   - The word \"baked\" is present in the sentence \"Freshly baked cookies.\" as required.\n   - The word does not include any punctuation signs, which is compliant.\n\nUpon examining all these elements, both the sentence and the word meet the input specification. The sentence, though a fragment, is acceptable as a grammatically correct structure in informal usage, and the word is properly extracted from it without punctuation. Therefore, there is no violation of the input specification.\n\nOK",
