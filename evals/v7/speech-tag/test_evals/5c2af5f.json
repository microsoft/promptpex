  "validityText": "The input consists of a sentence and a word. According to the input specification, the word must appear within the sentence. The provided sentence is \"This sentence cannot be processed.\" and the word is \"unprocesable\". \n\nFirstly, let's check if the sentence is a grammatically correct English sentence. \"This sentence cannot be processed.\" seems to be grammatically correct and fulfills the requirement as it includes a subject (\"This sentence\") and verb (\"cannot be processed\") and ends with a period.\n\nThe next step is to ensure that the word \"unprocesable\" is present in the sentence. Upon inspection, the word \"unprocesable\" does not appear within the sentence \"This sentence cannot be processed.\". Since the word is not in the sentence, there is a violation of the specification that the word must be present within the sentence provided.\n\nAnother condition is that the word should not include punctuation, and \"unprocesable\" complies with this as there are no punctuation marks in the word.\n\nHowever, the primary reason for non-compliance is the absence of the word \"unprocesable\" in the sentence \"This sentence cannot be processed.\" \n\nERR",
