  "coverage": "Noun",
  "validityText": "The input consists of a sentence and a word. First, I evaluate if the sentence \"Varied marbles on the floor.\" is a grammatically correct English sentence. The sentence is indeed grammatically correct as it follows the structure of a complete sentence having a subject (\"Varied marbles\"), a predicate, and an object \"on the floor\". Furthermore, the sentence includes punctuation, which is allowed by the specification.\n\nNext, I verify the presence of the word \"floor\" in the sentence. The word \"floor\" is indeed present in the sentence, matching exactly with the last word in the sentence. The word is not an empty string, and there is no punctuation attached to the word \"floor\" itself in the dictionary part of the input as needed by the specification. \n\nTo summarize:\n- The sentence is grammatically correct and not empty.\n- The word \"floor\" is present in the sentence and it is not an empty string.\n- The word does not contain any punctuation, which meets the input specification.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the input complies with all given specifications.\n\nOK",
