  "coverage": "Noun",
  "validityText": "The input consists of a sentence \"John loves Mary.\" and a word \"Mary\". Let's evaluate this input against the specification:\n\n1. **Sentence Requirement**: The sentence \"John loves Mary.\" appears to be a grammatically correct English sentence. It consists of a subject (\"John\"), a verb (\"loves\"), and an object (\"Mary\"). It also correctly starts with a capital letter and ends with a period, making it consistent with English grammar rules.\n\n2. **Word Requirement**: The word \"Mary\" is clearly identified within the sentence \"John loves Mary.\". \n\n3. **Word Presence**: The word \"Mary\" is indeed present in the sentence, fulfilling that requirement of the specification.\n\n4. **Word Integrity**: The word \"Mary\" does not include any punctuation, which aligns with the requirement that the word itself must not include punctuation signs.\n\n5. **Non-empty Strings**: Neither the sentence nor the word is an empty string. \n\nSince all conditions from the input specification are met with this input, I conclude that there is no violation of the input specification.\n\nOK",
