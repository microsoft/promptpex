Let's carefully evaluate the given input:\n\n1. **Sentence Requirement**: The sentence must be a grammatically correct English sentence. The provided sentence is \"Can you find the hidden treasure?\" which is a grammatically correct English sentence. It includes correct capitalization and punctuation (a question mark), meeting the requirement for a valid sentence with punctuation.\n\n2. **Presence of Word in Sentence**: The specification requires the word to be present within the sentence. The word given is \"hidden,\" and it is indeed present in the sentence \"Can you find the hidden treasure?\"\n\n3. **Empty String Prohibition**: The word must not be an empty string, and likewise, the sentence must not be an empty string. Here, the word is \"hidden,\" and the sentence is \"Can you find the hidden treasure?\" Neither is an empty string.\n\n4. **Punctuation Restriction on Word**: The word should not include punctuation signs. The word \"hidden\" does not include any punctuation signs, thereby meeting this criterion.\n\nSince all of the input specifications are satisfied without any violations:\n\nOK",
