  "validityText": "Upon evaluating the provided input in relation to the input specification, here is the reasoning process:\n\n1. Verify if the sentence is a grammatically correct English sentence: The sentence \"The session was remarkable.\" is a grammatically correct sentence.\n\n2. Check if the sentence is empty: The sentence is not an empty string.\n\n3. Confirm if the word is present within the sentence: The word provided is \"sessione\". Upon examining the sentence, the word \"sessione\" is not present. The similar-looking word \"session\" is in the sentence, but \"sessione\" explicitly with 'e' at the end is not. This violates the specification that requires the word to be present in the sentence.\n\n4. Ensure the word is not an empty string: \"sessione\" is not an empty string.\n\n5. Check if the word includes punctuation: The word \"sessione\" does not contain punctuation.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the provided word \"sessione\" is not part of the sentence, violating the requirement that the word must be present within the sentence. This leads to non-compliance with the input specification. \n\nERR",
