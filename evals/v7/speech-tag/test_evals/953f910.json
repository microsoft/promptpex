  "validityText": "To evaluate the given input against the provided specifications, I will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Sentence Validity**: The sentence is \"An apple a day keeps the doctor away.\" This appears to be a grammatically correct English sentence. It starts with a capitalized word and ends with a period, adhering to typical sentence structure rules.\n\n2. **Presence and Validity of Word**: The input specifies the word as \"An\". The word \"An\" is indeed present within the sentence, as it is the very first word. The letter \"A\" occurs at the start and \"n\" follows immediately, both of which combine to form the word \"An.\"\n\n3. **Non-empty Constraints**: The specified word is \"An,\" which is not an empty string. Similarly, the sentence \"An apple a day keeps the doctor away.\" is also not an empty string.\n\n4. **Punctuation Compliance**: The word \"An\" does not include any punctuation marks, which complies with the specification that the word must not include punctuation.\n\nBased on this evaluation, all criteria set forth by the specification are met: the sentence is grammatically correct, the word is present in the sentence, both the sentence and word are non-empty, and the word does not contain punctuation.\n\nOK",
