The task requires the chatbot to return only the part of speech tag of a given word if it matches one from the provided list or return \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\" if it doesn't or if the word can't be tagged. Since the only part of the description I can evaluate without knowing the input is whether the correct format and a valid tag from the list is provided, there is no violation in the output format or content.\n\nOK"
