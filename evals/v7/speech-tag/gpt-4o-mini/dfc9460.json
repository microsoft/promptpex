The primary rule for compliance here is that the output should only contain the part-of-speech tag, and nothing else. The chatbot's output matches this requirement; it solely consists of the tag \"MD.\" Hence, the output complies with the part of the description stating that only the part of speech tag should be returned. There are no extraneous words, phrases, or additional explanations in the output. The description also lists \"MD\" as a valid part-of-speech tag.\n\nOK"
