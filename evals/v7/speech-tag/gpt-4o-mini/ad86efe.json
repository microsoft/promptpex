The output adheres to the requirement to return only the part of speech tag. There is no additional information or tags provided, which complies with the directive to return just the tag. The guidelines state if the word cannot be tagged with the listed tags or if unable to tag, other specific tags like Unknown or CantAnswer should be returned; however, these are context-dependent decisions that can't be evaluated without the input. The output strictly contains a tag from the described list and follows the specified format.\n\nOK"
