  "complianceText": "The output \"IN\" represents a part of speech tag, specifically for a preposition or subordinating conjunction. This is one of the tags listed in the description provided, which includes a variety of part-of-speech tags. The output only includes the tag itself, without any additional information or explanation, and aligns with the guideline to return just the part of speech tag for the given word. The description also specifies that if no appropriate tag can be assigned, \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\" should be returned; however, there's no indication from the output that these would be relevant, as that would require input knowledge. \n\nNo violation.\nOK"
