Based on the description, the chatbot is required to return only a part-of-speech tag from the given list or return \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\" if the criteria are met. The output here is a valid part-of-speech tag (\"VB: Verb, base form\") from the list provided. Since I'm not given the input, I cannot verify its correctness regarding the sentence and word, but I can confirm it complies with the output format requirements specified in the description.\n\nOK"
