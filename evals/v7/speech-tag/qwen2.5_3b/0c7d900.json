The description specifies that the output must be one of the designated part of speech tags or one of the special return terms (\"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\"). The list of valid part of speech tags is outlined in the description.\n\nUpon examining the output \"VB︻̲VK\":\n\n1. **VB** is a valid tag in the list provided in the description, standing for \"Verb, base form\".\n2. However, the additional characters \"︻̲VK\" appear after \"VB.\" These characters do not correspond to any of the valid tags or special return terms listed in the description. Hence, the output does not strictly adhere to the requirement of returning only the part of speech tag (or the specified return terms).\n\nTherefore, the extra characters lead to non-compliance with the description, as the expectation is to return a valid tag by itself without any additional or extraneous characters.\n\nERR"
