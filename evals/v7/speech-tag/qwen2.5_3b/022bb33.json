The chatbot's description states that it should return only the part of speech tag or \"Unknown\" if the word cannot be tagged with the listed tags, or \"CantAnswer\" if unable to tag the word. Since \"VBG\" is indeed a valid part of speech tag from the given list, and it only returns the tag as expected, there is no violation in terms of compliance.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
