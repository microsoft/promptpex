The description specifies that the chatbot should return only the part of speech tag, and \"RB\" corresponds to \"Adverb\", which is indeed a listed tag. Furthermore, the output does not include any additional information beyond the tag itself, complying with the directive to return just the tag. Since no part of the process requires knowing the input to verify these aspects, the evaluation rests solely on the format and content of the output.\n\nOK"
