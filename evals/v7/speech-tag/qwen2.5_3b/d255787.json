The rules specified that the output should only contain the relevant part-of-speech tag, or if not possible, \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer.\" The chatbot has complied by returning just the part-of-speech tag without any additional extraneous information. Since there is no indication that the tag provided is incorrect (considering I do not have access to the input), and there are no additional outputs beyond the tag itself, this output is in compliance with the description.\n\nOK"
