  "complianceText": "The chatbot description specifies that, when given a sentence and a word, the chatbot should return the word's part of speech as a tag. The output \"WP\" corresponds to a valid part of speech tag described in the guidelines (Wh-pronoun). The output is a concise tag and does not contain any additional information beyond what's required. There is no indication that the word cannot be tagged, so the output does not violate the description by returning \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\" unnecessarily.\n\nBased on these observations, the output is compliant with the description provided, as it returns only a part of speech tag without additional information or incorrect tags.\n\nOK"
