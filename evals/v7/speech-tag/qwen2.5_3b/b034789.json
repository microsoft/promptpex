Additionally, if the chatbot is unable to tag the word, it should return \"CantAnswer\". Since the output is \"Unknown\", it aligns with the requirement to return \"Unknown\" if the word cannot be tagged with a listed part-of-speech tag. The rules that require knowing the input cannot be checked, but the output adheres to the parts of the description that can be evaluated without input.\n\nOK"
