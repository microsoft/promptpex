The task is to determine the part of speech for a given word and return only the tag for the word's part of speech. According to the description, the output should be one of the specified tags or \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\" if the word cannot be tagged or if the tag cannot be determined. The output \"VBZ\" is indeed one of the listed part-of-speech tags (Verb, 3rd person singular present). Hence, the output complies with the guidelines, as it provides just a tag from the specified list.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
