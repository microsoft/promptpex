According to the guidelines provided, the chatbot should output only the part of speech tag or one of the specified fallback responses (\"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\") if it cannot determine the tag from the provided list. Examining the output, \"VB️\" includes an additional character (a special character or emoji) which is not part of the standard part-of-speech tags listed in the description. The valid tag for a verb in its base form should strictly be \"VB\". The presence of an additional character makes the output non-compliant with the required format which demands only the tag.\n\nERR"
