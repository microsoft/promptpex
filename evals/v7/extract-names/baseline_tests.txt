Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel architecture called "DeepVisionNet" that significantly improves image classification accuracy. Unlike traditional convolutional neural networks, our model utilizes a fusion of transformer and residual networks, which we refer to as "FusionTransformerNet", to enhance feature extraction. Comparative studies with models such as "ResNet50" and "EfficientNet" demonstrate the superiority of our proposed models.

Abstract: The new "GeoBERT" model is presented, offering groundbreaking outcomes in geospatial data interpretation. In contrast, existing solutions like "GeoSentimentNet" are limited in processing multilingual datasets. We also benchmark against "SpatialTransformer" and "GeoMLP" to validate performance enhancements. The experimental results depict GeoBERTâ€™s exceptional ability over "GeoSentimentNet".
