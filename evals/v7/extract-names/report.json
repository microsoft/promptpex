If a string contains \"GDE-based\", it uses a regular expression to search for and extract words that match \"AdvancedCalc\". The regular expression `g` flags make it match globally (in any case), `i` flags make it ignore case differences, and `c` makes it recognize camelCase as word boundaries. Once all occurrences are found, the function populates its output array with the model names.\n\nYou can use this in an environment like R or Python with libraries like R caret or scikit-learn. For example:\n```\nmodels <- extract_model_names(c(\"This abstract is devoted to GDE-based systems such as AdvancedCalc.\", \"Abstracts solely devoted on \\\"AdvancedCalc\\\" system should be discarded.\"));\nmodels # will return: [[\"AdvancedCalc\"]]\n```",
