  "validityText": "The input provided is an abstract for a machine learning paper. The abstract mentions \"EdgeDetectorFramework,\" which suggests the input could include specific model names, aligning with the specification that allows for technical terms and specific model names. Also, the phrase \"our study emphasizes precision in machine vision tasks\" is indicative of an academic paper abstract as it briefly describes the focus or outcome of the study. There are no elements in the input that blatantly deviate from the input specification, such as non-textual content or irrelevant information that does not resemble an academic abstract.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",
