  "input": "Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel architecture called \"DeepVisionNet\" that significantly improves image classification accuracy. Unlike traditional convolutional neural networks, our model utilizes a fusion of transformer and residual networks, which we refer to as \"FusionTransformerNet\", to enhance feature extraction. Comparative studies with models such as \"ResNet50\" and \"EfficientNet\" demonstrate the superiority of our proposed models.",
