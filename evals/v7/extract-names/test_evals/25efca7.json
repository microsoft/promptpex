It mentions a system called \"EfficientTransformer,\" which suggests the inclusion of a specific model name, aligning with terms typical in machine learning papers. The sentence \"The system EfficientTransformer sets new benchmarks.\" uses formal language and suggests a novel contribution, which is typical for an abstract. Furthermore, the input contains no extraneous information or formatting that violates the specification. The input does not violate any guidelines stipulated in the input specification.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",
