  "coverage": "[\"Hybrid A* algorithm\"]",
  "validityText": "The input consists of a textual string that resembles a sentence from an academic paper abstract. It includes technical terms like \"Hybrid A* algorithm\" and references the topic of autonomous vehicles, both of which are common in machine learning and related fields. Given the input specification, we are looking for inputs that contain sentences and phrases typically found in machine learning paper abstracts. \n\nThe sentence provided showcases a contribution (\"optimized in our model\"), which fits the nature of an academic abstract, where methods or results are typically highlighted. The use of technical terms and reference to a specific model indicates compliance with the specification, which allows for technical terms, acronyms, and specific model names. \n\nNo violations are evident as the input meets all specified criteria: it is a textual string, it is characteristic of an academic abstract, and it includes technical content.\n\nOK",
  "validity": "ok"
