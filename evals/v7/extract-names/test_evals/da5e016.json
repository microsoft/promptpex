  "validityText": "The input is a textual string that appears to be an excerpt from an academic paper abstract. It includes technical terms, such as \"Capsule Network,\" which is a recognized model name in machine learning. The purpose is clearly related to a machine learning topic, specifically discussing improvements in \"data representation fidelity\" through a particular model architecture. Since these elements align with the input specification that requires sentences and phrases from an academic paper abstract, with allowance for technical terms and model names, the input complies.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",
