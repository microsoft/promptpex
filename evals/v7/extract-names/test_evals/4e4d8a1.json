  "validityText": "The input provided appears to be a sentence that could belong to an academic paper abstract. It includes the use of a technical term \"Support Vector Machine\" (SVM), which is a common model in machine learning, and mentions its application in classifying high-dimensional data. This aligns with the expectation that the input will include technical terms, acronyms, and potentially model names, facts known from the field of machine learning, pertinent to academic papers. The input also forms a coherent sentence, characteristic of academic text typically found in abstracts. Based on these observations, there are no violations found with the given specification of the input.\n\nOK",
