If no model names are found, or if the chatbot is uncertain, it should return an array with [\"NA\"]. In this case, the chatbot output is an empty array []. This does not comply with the description because it is neither a list of model names nor the specified [\"NA\"] when no model names are found or there is uncertainty. The specific element leading to this conclusion is the presence of an empty array instead of [\"NA\"]. \n\nERR"
