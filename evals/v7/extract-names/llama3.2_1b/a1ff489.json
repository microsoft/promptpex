  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output includes a response: [\\\"DeepMind’s Tau architecture can achieve state-of-the-art performance on all three benchmarking problems without any explicit mention\\\"]. This response does not comply with the format [\\\"model_name\\\"], as it contains a full sentence instead of a model name, violating the guideline to return model names in the format [\\\"model_name\\\"] only. Moreover, it ends with an explicit note stating that it will return [\\\"NA\\\"]. However, these two outputs are contradictory, and the correct format to follow should be a simple, singular array of model names or [\\\"NA\\\"]. Therefore, the response has two violations: one being the incorrect format of the extracted model names, and the second being a contradiction between stating it will return [\\\"NA\\\"] but instead providing another output format.\n\nERR"
