The output seems to comply with the guideline of returning `[\"NA\"]` when there are no model names or there's uncertainty about their presence. Without knowing the input, I cannot determine if the result should have been otherwise. There is no apparent violation based solely on the output provided.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
