The description specifies that the response should be an array of model names formatted as [\"model_name\"]. The output follows this format. Since I can't evaluate if the model name \"Deep Q-Network (DQN)\" was accurately extracted without the input, no issues related to correctness can be addressed. Given the format of the output conforms to the specified structure provided in the description, there are no violations in terms of compliance.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
