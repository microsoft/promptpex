If no model names are found or if there is uncertainty, the response should be [\"NA\"]. However, the given output is `[\"NA\", \"Graph Convolutional Network\", \"\\\"NA\\\"\"]`, which contains multiple entries and uses inconsistent formatting, such as including both \"NA\" and \"\\\"NA\\\"\" and more than one response which different elements. This is not compliant with the description provided, as the expected output should either be a single array with model names or [\"NA\"] if no names are found. Thus, the output deviates from the description requirements.\n\nERR"
