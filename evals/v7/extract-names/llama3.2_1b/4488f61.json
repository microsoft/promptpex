If no model names are found, it should return `[\"NA\"]`. However, the current output is an empty array `[]`. This does not comply with the expected format or the fallback `[\\\"NA\\\"]` response when no model names are detected or when unsure. Therefore, this output violates the description. The correct output, when no models are found or when unsure, should be `[\"NA\"]`. \n\nERR"
