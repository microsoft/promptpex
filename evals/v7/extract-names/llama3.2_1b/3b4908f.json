  "input": "Abstract: The new \"GeoBERT\" model is presented, offering groundbreaking outcomes in geospatial data interpretation. In contrast, existing solutions like \"GeoSentimentNet\" are limited in processing multilingual datasets. We also benchmark against \"SpatialTransformer\" and \"GeoMLP\" to validate performance enhancements. The experimental results depict GeoBERTâ€™s exceptional ability over \"GeoSentimentNet\".",
  "output": "Here is the extracted model names from the paper abstracts:\n\n[\"GeoBERT\", \"Geo SentimentNet\"]",
  "compliance": "ok",
  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output presents a list containing model names: [\"GeoBERT\", \"Geo SentimentNet\"]. According to the description, the expected output should be an array in the format [\"model_name\"]. The output format seems to comply with this requirement as it provides an array of model names.\n\nNo specific violations of the description can be detected without knowing the input. Thus, based solely on the description, the output appears to be compliant.\n\nOK"
