In this case, the output is [\"GraphCalc\", \"GraphCalc\"], which includes a duplicate model name. However, the description does not explicitly state whether duplicates are allowed or not. Since the compliance is based solely on the description and not on assumptions or inferences, the presence of duplicate model names does not violate the description as it stands.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
