  "complianceText": "The chatbot output seems to be a code snippet rather than a direct output of extracted model names as requested in the description. The output does not comply with the required format of providing an array of the model names, e.g., [\"model_name\"]. It should directly return [\"NA\"] if no model names are found or if not sure, rather than printing the result of a function. Furthermore, there's a technical error in the print statement as it's not using the expected input abstraction directly, leading to additional non-compliance with the described behavior.\n\nERR"
