The output is in an array format: [\"NNetSystem\"], which matches the format requirement described as [\"model_name\"]. Since I do not have the input, I cannot assess if the name corresponds to a model name from an abstract, but since that requires specific input knowledge, I will not consider it. The key focus is on the format compliance which, in this case, the output meets by presenting the model name in the array format required by the description. There is no evidence of formatting issues or non-compliance here.\n\nOK"
