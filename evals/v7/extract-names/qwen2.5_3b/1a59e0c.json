The format used in the output is slightly different from the specified format. The expected format for the output is [\"NA\"], but the chatbot's response is [[\"NA\"]], which introduces an unnecessary extra set of brackets, deviating from the specified output format. This discrepancy leads to a violation of the compliance guidelines regarding output formatting.\n\nERR"
