The output provided here follows the required format, as it is an array containing what appears to be a model name, \"ModelFusion\".\n\nSince the verification of correctness requires knowing the input abstract, which is not available here, we focus solely on the format of the output. There is no format violation here since it corresponds with the expected output structure, which is an array of model names.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
