  "complianceText": "The evaluation is based on whether the chatbot's output format aligns with the description given. According to the guidelines, the chatbot should return an array with the model names in the format `[\"model_name\"]`. The given output is `[[\"BenchmarkNet\"]]`, which is an array containing another array with a string inside. This output violates the specified format because it introduces an additional level of nesting, creating an array of arrays instead of a flat array. The description specifically states that the output should be a single-level array. Therefore, based on the format violation, this output does not comply with the description.\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
