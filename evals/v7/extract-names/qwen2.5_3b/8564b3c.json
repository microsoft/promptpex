The guidelines require the name to be placed within an array structure, and this condition is met. The evaluation does not require confirming whether \"BERT\" is an actual model name extracted from the input nor does it require checking if it is contained in the input, as the input is not provided. Given the guidelines, the output complies with the required format. Based on the limited information provided, there seems to be no violation of the description requirements.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
