According to the description, the chatbot is expected to return a list of model names in the format [\"model_name\"]. The output format [[\"Fuzzy Logic System\"]] contains an extra level of nesting (i.e., an additional set of square brackets), which violates the specification of the output format according to the description, which requires [\"model_name\"]. Therefore, this violates the requirement for the output format.\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
