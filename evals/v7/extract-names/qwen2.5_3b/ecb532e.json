The output correctly follows this format by returning [[\"NA\"]], which matches the description's requirement of an array format. The additional square brackets used in the output do not contravene the description as it does not explicitly prohibit nested brackets and still clearly follows the intended requirement of the output being an array. Therefore, there are no explicit violations of the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
