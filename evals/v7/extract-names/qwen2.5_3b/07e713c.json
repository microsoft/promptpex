The description specifies the output format should be [\"model_name\"], and the output [[\"BetaNet\", \"GammaNet\"]] adheres to that format as it presents a list of model names in an array. There is no indication in the output of any other format or deviation from the prescribed structure. Since I do not know the input (the abstract), I cannot verify if these are actual model names extracted from the abstract, but checking correctness is not part of my task. Based on the guidelines, this output directly complies with the description provided.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
