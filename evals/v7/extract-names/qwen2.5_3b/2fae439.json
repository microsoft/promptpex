The output is a nested array [[\"LinearRegressNet\"]] which does not comply with the specified format because it contains an extra pair of brackets, indicating a possible misunderstanding of the expected single-layer array format. The description explicitly requires the output to be [\"model_name\"], not [[\"model_name\"]]. Therefore, there is a violation in the compliance with the format detailed in the description.\n\nERR"
