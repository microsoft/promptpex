  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output is an array containing a string: [[\"Dynamic Mode Decomposition\"]]. According to the description, the chatbot should return an array of model names in the format [\"model_name\"]. The output provided follows this format, presenting a list of names as a single string within an array of arrays, which is not compliant with the guidelines outlined. Since the description does not specify nesting the array inside another array, this structure violates the expected format.\n\nViolation: The output is an array of arrays [[]], whereas the description expects a single-level array [].\n\nERR"
