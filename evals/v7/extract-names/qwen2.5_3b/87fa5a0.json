According to the description, the expected format for model names should be a simple array in the format [\"model_name\"]. Therefore, the output format in the chatbot's response does not comply with the description as it uses double square brackets instead of a single set. This discrepancy in formatting is a violation of the output guidelines specified in the description.\n\nERR"
