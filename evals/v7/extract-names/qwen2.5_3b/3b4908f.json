  "input": "Abstract: The new \"GeoBERT\" model is presented, offering groundbreaking outcomes in geospatial data interpretation. In contrast, existing solutions like \"GeoSentimentNet\" are limited in processing multilingual datasets. We also benchmark against \"SpatialTransformer\" and \"GeoMLP\" to validate performance enhancements. The experimental results depict GeoBERTâ€™s exceptional ability over \"GeoSentimentNet\".",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot output consists of an array with multiple model names: [\"GeoBERT\", \"GeoSentimentNet\", \"SpatialTransformer\", \"GeoMLP\"]. According to the description, the task of the chatbot is to extract model names and provide them in the format [\"model_name\"]. The format of the output is correct, as it is an array of strings representing model names. The description also notes that if no model names are found or the model names are uncertain, the output should be [\"NA\"]. However, this is not relevant to judge as it requires knowing the input. As the given format and structure of output adhere precisely to the required specifications laid out in the description, there is no violation found in terms of compliance with the description given to me for evaluation.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
