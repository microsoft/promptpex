The output provided is in this format, as it consists of an array with a single model name string inside. Based solely on the output format, there is no indication of a violation of the described output format. Since I don't have the input, I cannot check whether \"QuantumNet\" is a correct or appropriate model name from the abstract. Therefore, as far as compliance with the format of the output is concerned, it is correct.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
