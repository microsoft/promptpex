This complies directly with the instruction to extract model names and format them as such. Since you are not required to validate the correctness of the model name without input, compliance can be confirmed based on format alone. The chatbot's response matches the guidelines without needing to determine if this model name actually appears in the abstract, as that requires knowing the input.\n\nOK"
