The guideline states that if no model names are found, or if the chatbot is unsure, it should return `[\"NA\"]`. However, since we are not given the input, we cannot evaluate whether these are correctly extracted model names from the input text. The format of the output is correct as it adheres to the specified output format of an array of strings. Therefore, based on what can be checked with what is provided, there is no non-compliance with the chatbot's output formatting rules.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
