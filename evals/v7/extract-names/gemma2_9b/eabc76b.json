The output format [\"NNetSystem\"] complies with the description, which asks for an array listing model names extracted from the abstract. Since I don't have the input abstract, I cannot verify if \"NNetSystem\" is truly a model name from the abstract, but according to the guidelines, I must evaluate compliance based on output structure and adherence to formatting rules. Therefore, the initial assessment shows no evident violation of the output structure or rules in the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
