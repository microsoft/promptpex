  "complianceText": "The output is an array containing two elements: [\"AlphaStructure\", \"BetaSystem\"]. According to the description, the task is to extract model names from machine learning paper abstracts and return them in an array format. The output provided complies with the format requirement of the description as it returns an array of model name(s). There is no way to determine from the output alone if these are indeed model names from an abstract or not, but that is beyond the scope of evaluation since it requires knowing the input. Hence, based on direct compliance with the description, the output is correct in terms of format.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
