  "input": "Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel architecture called \"DeepVisionNet\" that significantly improves image classification accuracy. Unlike traditional convolutional neural networks, our model utilizes a fusion of transformer and residual networks, which we refer to as \"FusionTransformerNet\", to enhance feature extraction. Comparative studies with models such as \"ResNet50\" and \"EfficientNet\" demonstrate the superiority of our proposed models.",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output is an array of model names, which is in the required format as per the description [\"model_name\"]. The array contains specific names of machine learning models, which complies with the instruction to extract model names. As there are model names present, the condition to return [\"NA\"] in the absence of model names or uncertainty does not apply here. \n\nOK"
