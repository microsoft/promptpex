This format of output is consistent with the requirement from the description to provide an array of model names in the format [\"model_name\"]. There are no indications or evidence that the description has been violated based solely on the given output. Since I do not have the input, I cannot determine if the model names are correct, if they should have been extracted, or if \"NA\" should have been returned. However, from what is provided, the format and structure comply with the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
