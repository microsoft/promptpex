This format adheres to the expected output format stipulated in the description, which is [\"model_name\"]. There is no context or indication in the output that it is not in compliance with the given guidelines.\n\nSince the evaluation process does not include verifying the correctness of these model names against the input or confirming their existence in the abstract due to lack of input access, the output's compliance should be judged solely on whether it follows the described response format, which it does. There are no issues of non-compliance within the visible output content.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
