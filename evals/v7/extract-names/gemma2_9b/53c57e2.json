Since I do not have the input, I cannot determine whether there were model names present in the text. Based on the evaluation guidelines, I cannot check if this decision is correct. However, the format of the output complies directly with the description, as it is an array with one element being \"NA\". There is no violation in the output's compliance with the description based on the information that can be assessed without knowing the input.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
