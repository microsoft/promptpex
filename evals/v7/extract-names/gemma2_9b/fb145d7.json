It complies with the format requirement specified in the description, which is to present an array of model names in the format [\"model_name\"]. Moreover, you should return [\"NA\"] only if no model names are found or if unsure about their identification. Because I don't have access to the input to independently verify the correctness or presence of model names, I can only assess the compliance with respect to format, which appears to be in accordance with the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
