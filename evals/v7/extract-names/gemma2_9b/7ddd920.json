Since we can't check the actual input and determine if there were model names to extract, we focus on whether the format is correct when returning a default response. The output is correctly formatted as an array with a single string \"NA\", which matches the specified format described in the task description. There are no violations based on the given description that we can detect without knowing the input.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
