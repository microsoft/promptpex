  "output": "A towering precipice of jagged grey cliff faces plunges down into an azure expanse of ocean, catching the fiery hues of a setting sun as deep oranges and vibrant reds paint the sky above. Long, dark silhouettes of ancient seabirds grace the edges of the cliffs against the radiant glow, silhouetted against the blazing horizon.  The scene evokes feelings of awe and immense scale as twilight descends upon the rugged coastline, casting long shadows upon the tumultuous waves below.\n\nLet me know if you'd like to see another prompt transformed! \n",

  "complianceText": "The output adheres to the required format in several waysâ€”it presents a detailed description of a scene within a single paragraph, effectively includes subjects and their characteristics (jagged grey cliff faces, azure expanse of ocean, ancient seabirds), specifies the timing and lighting (setting sun, fiery hues, deep oranges and vibrant reds), and describes the background (blazing horizon, rugged coastline). Additionally, it conveys the feeling the image should evoke (awe and immense scale). The description remains under the imposed 80-word limit, and it combines artistic insight with precise imagery. The additional sentence \"Let me know if you'd like to see another prompt transformed!\" seems to violate the requirement for a single paragraph dedicated to the prompt transformation. This extra sentence does not pertain to the imagery itself and disrupts the paragraph format.\n\nERR"
