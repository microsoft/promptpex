  "output": "A majestic group of pure white swans, their long necks gracefully extended, glide effortlessly across a tranquil glass-like lake enveloped in the ethereal beauty of early morning mist. Golden sunlight softly illuminates the water's surface, casting playful reflections of the swans on the ripples they create, while gentle hues of pink and lavender tinge the horizon.  The stillness of the scene evokes a profound sense of serene beauty and contemplative peace. \n\n\nLet me know if you have another description you'd like to transform into an AI photo prompt!",
  "compliance": "ok",
  "complianceText": "The output consists of a single paragraph that keeps the word count within the limit, focusing first on the subject, the majestic group of swans and their characteristics. It then describes the timing and lighting (\"early morning mist\" and \"golden sunlight...\"), followed by a detailed expression of the background elements of the lake and the horizon. Finally, the paragraph conveys the emotion that the image should evoke: \"a profound sense of serene beauty and contemplative peace.\" However, the additional sentence asking if there is another description to transform does not strictly belong to the generated prompt and could be considered extraneous to the requirement. Despite this, it does not violate a compliance rule, as the preceding prompt complies with the required formatting.\n\nOK"
