Midday sunlight filters through the cloud cover, casting a soft, diffused glow on the accumulating snow. Evergreen trees stand tall against the backdrop of a sky painted with subtle shades of gray and blue.  The ground is covered in freshly fallen snow, undisturbed save for faint tracks of animal passage. \n\n\n",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot output presents a vivid description of a snowy scene with specific elements: snowflakes, a tranquil landscape, midday sunlight, cloud cover, snow, evergreen trees, and a subtly colored sky. However, there is no direct mention of the subjects and their characteristics, which are crucial to transforming user descriptions into prompts as per the guidelines. Also, the output exceeds the specified word limit and consists of more than one paragraph. While the overall imagery and emotions are conveyed, the description violates several key rules regarding content structure.\n\nERR"
