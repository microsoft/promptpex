It focuses first on the subject, highlighting their characteristics, as it describes \"a confident speaker\" with \"clear and expressive\" hand gestures. The timing and lighting are addressed with \"illuminated by spotlights\" and \"faint glow of an auditorium spotlight.\" The background is described with \"a simple, neutral stage curtain.\" However, the output does not conclude with conveying the feeling the image should evoke. This violates the requirement of concluding by conveying the feeling the image should evoke.\n\nERR"
