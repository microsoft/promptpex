Delicate florals unfurl in gardens bathed in soft, warm morning light. Soft blues and pinks seep into wooden dock details as evening clouds gather over waterways, creating a serene silhouette.",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot output follows the single-paragraph structure requirement and is written in English. However, it contains more than 80 words, counting to approximately 52 words for certain parts repeated which might indicate formatting errors or omissions in the output seen. It also does not organize the output by first detailing subjects and their characteristics, then timing and lighting, followed by the background, and finally conveying the feeling the image should evoke. The emphasis seems primarily on the description rather than following the structured order: florals and gardens first, which are shifted between morning and evening settings, but it does not distinctly separate each element as outlined in the description. The repetition of a sentence disrupts the flow as well.\n\nERR"
