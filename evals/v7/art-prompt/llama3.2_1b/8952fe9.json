Paint the scene against a warm golden light, as if set ablaze by the approaching hour. The gentle haze of day succumbs to an inky darkness, suffusing the landscape with an otherworldly glow. Delicate touches of pink and orange bleed into the sea, imbuing the drama with a sense of primordial power.\"",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot output begins with a statement about transforming a user description without directly providing a transformed prompt. The description follows, detailing a rugged coastline at sunset, the characteristics of cliffs, vivid silhouettes, and a fiery sky. It includes elements of timing (sunset), lighting (warm golden light), and background (coastline and ocean). It also evokes a feeling of \"breathtaking majesty\" and \"primordial power.\" However, it appears to exceed the 80-word limit and is more than one paragraph long. The description is intended to be crafted into a single, concise paragraph, which has not been done here.\n\nERR"
