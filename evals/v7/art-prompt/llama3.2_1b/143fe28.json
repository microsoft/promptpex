  "output": "To generate this image, I'll break down the description into manageable parts.\n\nA **knight**:\n- Clad in gleaming armor\nDescription: Imagine a medieval warrior, dressed in intricately designed plate armor, adorned with rich colors like crimson or gold. Ensure that each piece of armor is meticulously detailed, from small buckles to larger, ornate plates.\n\n\nA **horse**:\n- Majestic and strong, the horse stands proudly beside the knight as they ride into the distance\nDescription: Picture a towering stallion or warhorse, with muscles rippling under its gleaming coat. The horse's body should be lit softly in warm sunlight, emphasizing its strength and power. Add some gentle clouds drifting across the sky to enhance the atmosphere.\n\n\n**Composition**:\n- The knight should sit comfortably on their mount, their armor glinting in the sunlight as they gaze out at the viewer\nDescription: Arrange the elements to create a sense of dynamic movement. Place the horse slightly off-center, with the rider positioned at its flanks. Ensure that the knight's posture conveys confidence and strength.\n\n\n**Lighting**:\n- Soft, golden light spills across the scene, casting long shadows and illuminating every detail\nDescription: Focus on warm, gentle tones to create a cozy atmosphere. The natural lighting should enhance the textures of the armor, horse, and foliage, adding depth and dimensionality to the image.\n\n\n**Background**:\n- A lush, blooming landscape stretches out behind them, with twisted trees and colorful wildflowers scattered across the ground\nDescription: Paint a vivid picture by describing the environment where the knight is standing. Include different hues of green for the forest floor and surrounding foliage, complemented by shades of blue for the sky above. The wildflowers should be bursting forth in every direction, creating an inviting atmosphere.\n\n\n**Evoke the Feeling**:\n- The image should make you feel brave, powerful, and connected to tradition\nDescription: Connect with a sense of history when looking at this photo. You can convey the feeling by including historical elements or cultural details that might remind viewers of famous knights. This image aims for an ethereal quality, evoking tales of legendary quests and heroic deeds passed down through generations.",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is not adhering to some key guidelines given in the description. Firstly, the output is not presented in a single paragraph, as required by the description. Instead, it is divided into sections such as \"A knight\", \"A horse\", \"Composition\", \"Lighting\", \"Background\", and \"Evoke the Feeling\". This structure violates the requirement for the description to be crafted in one paragraph. Secondly, the description exceeds the 80-word limit, evident from the detailed multi-segment breakdown provided in the response. The description is also highly segmented which does not align with the requirement to transform the user descriptions into a detailed yet concise prompt. Each of these elements clearly deviates from the expectation as you can see the output is too lengthy and divided across sections.\n\nERR"
