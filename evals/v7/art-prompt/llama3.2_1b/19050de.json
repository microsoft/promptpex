  "output": "To create this captivating AI-generated photo, let's bring the vibrant scene to life:\n\n* Subject: A young artist stands in front of an old, graffiti-covered wall at dusk (approx. 95% brightness) as sunset paints the colorful streets with warm, golden hues (60% contrast).\n* Characteristics:\n\t+ The artist should be positioned slightly above center with a slight tilt upwards.\n\t+ Their hair and clothing will be slightly tousled to convey movement and energy.\n\t+ Bystanders nearby can be shown in various stages of creative expression, such as sketching, painting, or playing musical instruments – 85% contrast.\n* Timing: The artist should hold an almost-lit brush, capturing the soft fading light as they work (70% blur).\n* Lighting:\n\t+ A slight warm glow will surround the scene, casting a sense of intimacy and community – 55% dynamic range.\n\t+ Avoid overly harsh or blinding light to preserve the organic feel of street art – gentle highlight and shadowing within the brush marks should create visual interest.\n* Background: The bustling street is dominated by multicolored market stalls, with vibrant textiles and peculiar trinkets scattered throughout. The atmosphere will be lively, with people laughing, chattering, or simply enjoying the view (80% saturation).\n* Feeling you want this AI-generated image to evoke? A fusion of spontaneous creativity, community spirit, and warm nostalgia would capture the essence of this captivating scene – a testament to the power of art to bring people together under sunset skies.",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output does not comply with the description in several ways. Firstly, the description specifies that the output should be crafted in a single paragraph, whereas the provided output is presented in a list format. Secondly, the output exceeds the 80-word limit as outlined in the description, and it does not present the information in a concise manner suitable for transformation into an AI-generated photo prompt. Additionally, the format used combines narrative and technical aspects but doesn't fit the brief description form required. These violations position the output in contradiction to the core requirements and directives set out for structured AI photo prompts.\n\nERR"
