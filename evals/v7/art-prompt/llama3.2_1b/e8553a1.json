  "output": "\"I want an image of a bustling newsroom filled with journalists at their respective desks, surrounded by high-speed wall clocks showcasing international time zones. The overhead lighting should be harsh and intense, highlighting the sense of urgency as if the news is unfolding just before breaking. The staff members should be posed in dynamic positions, their facial expressions conveying concentration and focus. To add depth, faint images of newspaper clippings or maps on nearby screens or walls could subtly hint at the rapidly changing global events being covered. Meanwhile, a prominent globe or map behind them adds to the sense of international perspective, while still maintaining the pulsating atmosphere evident from inside.\"",
