  "output": "To capture this serene moment, envision a majestic bald eagle in mid-air, effortlessly gliding over a serene, emerald-green ocean with soft ripples and gentle foamy crests, as the warm sunlight dances across its feathers. Capture the eagle's wings outstretched, with a subtle sheen on its talons, allowing the texture of its wing against the water to appear nuanced. On the horizon, a gradual fade from azure to navy blue allows the viewer's gaze to linger on the unfolding narrative: a sea gull floating nearby, while an underwater school of fish glimmer in the shadowy depths below, surrounded by a subtle layer of turquoise and indigo haze. Capture this moment when silence is broken only by the whispered secrets carried by the wind. This image should evoke a sense of serene wonder, transporting the viewer to a world where time stands still.",
  "compliance": "err",
  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not comply with the description on several counts. Firstly, the output exceeds the 80-word limit specified in the description. The generated prompt is not a single paragraph; instead, it consists of multiple sentences that could be broken into separate paragraphs. Secondly, the focus on the subject and their characteristics, timing, lighting, background, and the feeling the image should evoke is present but presented in a way that lacks the briefness required by the description. Overall, while the components specified in the description are addressed, the manner of addressing (e.g., paragraph structure and length) does not comply with the given requirements.\n\nERR"
