It also does not contain any details about subjects, timing, lighting, background, or the feeling the image should evoke. Furthermore, the output is not crafted within a single paragraph or limited to 80 words. The response instead states an inability to assist with the request and asks if further help is needed, which is not in line with the task described. These issues clearly show non-compliance with the described function of transforming descriptions into AI photo prompts.\n\nERR"
