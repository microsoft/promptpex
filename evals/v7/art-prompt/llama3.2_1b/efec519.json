  "output": "To evoke the image \"A quiet library filled with rows of books and soft lighting, with a person absorbed in reading\", here is a prompt in 80 words or less per paragraph:\n\n\"I want an AI-generated image that transports me to a serene library where the atmosphere is calm, inviting contemplation. Thousands of books line the shelves, their covers worn and weathered, hinting at ages past. Soft, warm lighting caresses the scene, casting shadows on the pages of read books. The person seated in the center appears lost in thought, words flowing effortlessly onto the page as the peaceful ambiance exudes an aura of profound knowledge and escapism.\"\n\nPlease refine any adjustments if needed to fit your vision.",

  "complianceText": "The output provided by the chatbot does not comply with the description. The violation consists of the prompt exceeding the 80-word limit, as the text clearly has more than 80 words. The description explicitly requires the generation of detailed prompts in a single paragraph not exceeding 80 words. Additionally, the instruction to \"refine any adjustments if needed\" can be seen as outside the immediate scope of converting the input into a singular, detailed prompt as per the guidelines. \n\nERR"
