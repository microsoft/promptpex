  "output": "A valiant knight, adorned in dazzling silver armor, rides a majestic black stallion. The armor reflects the sunlight, creating a radiant display of light with intricate engravings and battle scars, showcasing the knight's bravery. \n\nThis scene unfolds during a golden hour just before sunset, casting a warm glow that accentuates the knightâ€™s figure against the silhouette of rolling hills. \n\nThe background features a lush, green landscape, dotted with wildflowers and a distant castle. A sense of determination and nobility emanates from the image, evoking a feeling of adventure and courage.",
  "compliance": "err",
  "complianceText": "The output does not comply with the chatbot description for a few reasons. Firstly, the output exceeds the limit of being a single paragraph; it is instead divided into three distinct sections. According to the description, the entire prompt should be crafted as a singular paragraph. Additionally, although the description itself states that the output should not exceed 80 words, it does not explicitly provide the word count of the output for validation. However, there is a clear structural issue with the output being separated into multiple paragraphs, which directly violates the description's requirement for a single paragraph structure.\n\nERR"
