  "complianceText": "The output is a detailed description that appears to transform the user's input into a prompt for generating an AI photo. It follows the specified structure: it begins with the subject and its characteristics (a lone surfer riding a wave, spirit of adventure and freedom), provides details on timing and lighting (sunset casting golden and red hues, sky with oranges, pinks, purples), describes the background (silhouettes of distant cliffs and shimmering ocean), and concludes with the feeling the image should evoke (a sense of thrill and liberation). The description is articulate and contained within a single paragraph. However, without knowing the word count, I cannot confirm if it exceeds 80 words. Despite this, based on the visible structure and content, it complies with the description specifications that can be evaluated without knowing the input.\n\nOK"
