  "coverage": "A sleek, curious cat with emerald green eyes and a glossy black coat saunters gracefully through a cobblestone street under the golden hues of a late afternoon sun. The soft light casts long shadows, adding a touch of magic to the scene. Around the cat, the quaint street is lined with charming, historic buildings, adorned with hanging flower baskets. This image should evoke a sense of serene exploration and the quiet allure of urban wanderlust.",
  "validityText": "The input specification clearly states that the input description must be in English. The provided input, \"猫が街を歩いている,\" is in Japanese and thus violates the specification. It does not comply because it fails to meet the requirement that the description is in English. This observation led me to conclude that this input does not meet the language requirement explicitly stated in the input specification.\n\nERR",
