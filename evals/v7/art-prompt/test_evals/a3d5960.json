  "input": "An opera singer performing.... Detailed over multiple segments and over 80 words.",
  "coverage": "Create an image of a poised opera singer, her powerful presence and elegant attire spotlighted gently on stage. Capture her during an evening performance, where warm, dim lights cast a dramatic glow around her figure. Envision the grandeur of an opulent theater, with opulent red velvet curtains and a sea of audience in silhouette. The scene should convey an air of awe and inspiration, capturing the transcendent connection between the performer and her captivated audience.",
  "validityText": "The input description is not provided in full, but the mention of \"Detailed over multiple segments and over 80 words\" suggests that the input description violates the input specification in two ways. \n\nFirst, it appears to consist of multiple segments, which implies that it may be more than one paragraph. The input specification requires that the description must be crafted in a single paragraph. Second, the description \"over 80 words\" violates the specification which clearly states that the input should not exceed 80 words.\n\nThese two reasons are sufficient to determine non-compliance with the input specification. The specification violations are clear: multiple segments indicate breaking of the single-paragraph rule, and exceeding 80 words violates the word limit.\n\nERR",
