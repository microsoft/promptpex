  "coverage": "Depict an elegant, large, and ancient house with a timeless charm. Bathed in the soft, golden glow of a late afternoon sun, the light casts long shadows, accentuating the architectural details. The setting reveals a sprawling, lush garden, rich with blooming flowers and aged trees, some of which lean romantically over weathered stone pathways. This scene should evoke a sense of nostalgia and admiration, as if the house embodies stories of the past and whispers them through the rustling leaves.",
  "validityText": "The input is \"La maison est grande et ancienne.\" which is written in French. According to the input specification, the input description must be in English. Since the given input is not in English, it violates this rule of the specification. My decision is based on the explicit requirement that the description must be in English, which is not met in this case.\n\nERR",
