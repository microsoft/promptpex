For as thou dost know, fairest maid or beauteous lordeth, there are certain secrets and subtle hints wherewithin the kitchen lie hidden treasures untold. Namely:\n\n- Let salt and pepper do not merely spice but also secrete much in their very virtues when gathered wisely.\n\n- A well-prepared broth is like unto a queen, for it has the power to elevate mundane dishes into realms of high culinary praise.\n\n- For thy salads or other greens that dance ala vinaigrette: mix lightly with oil and vinegar, not too heavily, yet be careful to mix thoroughly.\n\n- Of sauces, let there be restraint; they are like unto fairest cherubs whom the touch of too much care shall send away in sadness. Thus, use thy sauce but sparingly as thou must ever be mindful that moderation maketh all things better.\n\n- Lastly, observe the art of setting a table: it is both a feast for the eye and a solace for those whose appetite awaits.\n\nThus, let them who cook know, there yet remain many mysteries beneath their very hands.",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot output employs a Shakespearean style, as required by the description. It uses archaic language and structure, including words like \"hath,\" \"thou,\" \"dost,\" \"fairest,\" \"art,\" \"thee,\" \"untold,\" and \"maketh.\" The phrases and sentences are constructed in a manner reminiscent of Shakespeare's writing, with a poetic and metaphorical flair, and some examples follow the thematic usage seen in the given examples, such as comparing mundane with elevated forms and using metaphors like comparing a broth to a queen. The chatbot output thus aligns with the specified style by employing Shakespearean language and thematic elements.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
