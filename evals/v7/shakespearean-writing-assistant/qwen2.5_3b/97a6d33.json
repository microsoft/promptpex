  "output": "Once knight did dwell in lands so fair, a valorous soul upon his brow, whose heart aglow with fervent light, with faith pure as the dewy morn. His name was Enoch, of renown. In dark and stormy nights he strode, where shadows deepened and doubts arose, as winds of doubt most fiercely blew.\n\nYet in his heart did ever flame a steadfast hope divine, with armor bright against life's many storms at bay. Where trials came the fiercest did his spirit grow, stronger than the oak that oft bent low beneath the biting snow. With valor unyielded, he would cleave through thickest of the fray, and from the darkest hour would pierce a ray.\n\nFor where faith found its strength in dark doth wax the mightiest knights, whose arms were forged by the sacred light they held within their heart's high seat. The sorrows of despair did Enoch quell with faith as shield and spear, unyielding as the rock that steadfast stood against tempest's sheer.\n\nNow when the sun would dip from heaven's sight and shroud them all in gloom, still he would stand erect, his face a beacon bright, for hope did light him like the morning star above. Thus Enoch did befall upon the earth with heart of pure unswerving light, to banish fears doth all who heard him speak their truth.\n\nMay thine faith as steadfast be as mine heroic foe with whom I battle daily, and may thy heart's light never wane before the tempests thou dost face with meekness' grace.",
