That thou doth keep me from my loue's abode,  \nWhose presence hath hitherto been my life and comfort's roche.  \nWherefore art thou thus exiled from mine eyes, sweet creature?  \nArt thou not aware that in thy absence all is grey?  \nEach flower and linden buds have missed their fair beholder,  \nAnd I myself in melancholy do now hang heady low.\nWoulds't thou not rather see me mourning, pined away with woes,\nThan part from beauty so profound, for whom my heart alone would sing?\nOh fairest one, dost thou not sense the woe thou cause'st?  \nThou who hast made the night appear fair by thy company!  \nSweet creature of my soul's devotion, do return to me,  \nOr else prepare thyself for anguish both intense and severe.",
