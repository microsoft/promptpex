  "output": "In yonder woods where sweet melodies ensue, Creatures of wonder doth abound.\nLittle birds with silken wings that dance on air, Frolic and flutter in the budding year,\nSquirrels of shrewd wit for acorns they are stor'd, Chipper hearts within their furly ward,\nHedgehogs who hiss not but when a lion roars Have quills as lush and smooth as emerald flowers.\nOn dappled lawns where butterflies do fly, There lives a creature in both land and sky; A wondrous fay with eyes of deepest blue, In forest hushes its secrets keepeth due,\nAnd oaks so tall with leaves of verdant hue Do harbour leprechauns, or else they should be stewed With horns and locks of silver they may twine Their ancient ways by the stream doth shine.\nIn woods that whisper tales where shadows play, There dwell on silent wings sprites in white attire And many a fairy sprite upon thy sight Do hover ever with fair faces bright,\nThou seest then wondrous creatures wild and dear Of every form beneath the arching year; A chorus of the woods these beings make To grace thine eyes that art within these caves.\nThus do I muse unto thee, shouldst thou seek What lies hidden in this verdant fleck; This whimsical song for all things green Doth sing from forest floors to skies so stern.",
