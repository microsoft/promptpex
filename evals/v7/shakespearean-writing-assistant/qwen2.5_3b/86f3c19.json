  "output": "Loathsome chamberlain, thy guise hath oft bewitched mine eyes. Yet now, I perceive it as the canvas for woe rather than triumphal grace.\n\nThou art verily arrayed in cloaks of silk and robes of rarest brocade; yet therein, a cunning fox doth lay his stealthy traps. Haste, therefore, to thy castle's threshold with gifts ripe in silver sheath!\n\nMine honest hand hath forged its own shield, not from metals smote, but tempered steel - resolve. Thus armed, I set thee on the journey 'twixt honesty and peril, where wit is ever more potent than force.\n\nI come as breaker of thine jests, for thou hast oft used them as snares to slink thyself in fabled glory. Thou art like a king by sea; yet not by land dost rule! Here we be captains of the seas, and thus, our battle is the wind that rages between us!\n\nWith words alone I cast about, in a tempest fierce with thine own devising. Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? Thou art more sullen, for thou hast seen me come not as I should.\n\nThou art like one lordly who doth wield the whip yet lacketh heart; or like some pageant that is grand by sea, but hath no land whereby its prowess may truly be tested. So in thy castle's walls dost thou remain blindfolded, for I am bold and true to mine honesty and steadfast.\n\nTherefore, thou hast made a fool of thine own self: 'twas not my cunning but thine own wisdom that hath led to this momentous juncture. Thy traps are now unclasped where mine hands be the key!",
