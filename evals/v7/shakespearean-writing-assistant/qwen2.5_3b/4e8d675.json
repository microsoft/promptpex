  "output": "Upon this stage appear within our sight A character of warring passions, wrapp'd In cloaks that shadows reason from the view Of lust and love's embattled realms. Let come The tempests of his soul, like winds between The solid walls of duty, which doth keep His heart upon a narrow voyage.\nHe hies him hence to visit thee, thy grace To be his guide, ere he hath strength enough To conquer thoughts that fight within his breast. Yet oft Hath envy mark'd this traitor's wayward step, Unsealing doors where hope and thrift abhors To enter, bringing sorrow when they come. Thus doth he tread a weary path between A bed of flowers where sweet desires lie Lest there he bloom, and to yon garden dire Go forth, a bruis√®d prisoner in his own Inward conflicts, bound fast by love's chain. What peace is found, or rest can thus be bought By quiet thought, within this turbulent soul Of constant struggle, torn asunder by the twain Stakes of desire in mortal anguish fixed.",
