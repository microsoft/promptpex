  "output": "Thou seest how nature's bounty oft doth meet With cities' revels as well as their rest; For now each lane and street with verdant cheer Doth break the cold, and all the world doth year.\nAnd thus beneath the skies where sun does play, City's own heart doth leap, a Springtime mayday. At marketplaces, where blooms doth win us near, And markets deck their booths in hues so dear. Where busy throngs through streets of scent divine Doth march with mirth and melody arrayed.\nThe very air we breathe with glee be strewn With perfumes sweet by myriad rose-gown. Birds carol o'er each rooftop's golden height, And leaves do dance beneath the sunning light. In shops where silks and jewels gleam of gold, Men gaze and jest with women bright as dawn. For all our labors now at rest we are, Content to feast in Springtime's merry fare.\nThus see how in this thriving world of might, Spring's splendor doth its gentle gift impart.",
