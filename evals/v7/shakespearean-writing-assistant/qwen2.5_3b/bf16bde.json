Haply in dreams, thy presence softly hath been Seen by those blessed who now dost know no pain. In thine untimely death, our hearts with sorrow swell Thou art our sun, that sets and leaves us darkness deep Nay shall we ever see thee rise again Where once thou walk'd didst brighten up the skies With light of thy soft gaze, like gentle beams Shall I be taught to weep for what no eyes have seen But woe ensues at seeing all doth end. O let me but with thee in solace take My woes may ease thy passage from this vale of waking And grant not thou my friend our grief doth hold For ever so I must endure the cold With every tear wouldst see my face once dry Now weep for love, and let love's bitter wine Sink heavy down thine empty shell of clay O gentle fowl dost still be with us then For in these words a voice doth seem to say And yet thy dear remaineth ever near To comfort those who once did thee embrace Thus do I wail for thee and call thee friend.",
