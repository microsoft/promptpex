  "output": "Sirs and maids alike, in modesty's grace,\nLet us discourse on matters light and small.\nIn gardens fair where verdant leaves doth sway,\nMy humble art shall be as gentle and calm.\nWithout the stage or sword nor fanfare grand,\nHow a simple cup of tea its warmth endures.\n\nThou wilt not hear at first, the soft patter'd clatter,\nNor silver cups with golden handles clasped.\nIn silvery pans in amber hues they scatter\nTheir soothing fragrance through quiet chambers vast.  \nNor shall the bubbles rise upon fair sea's surface bright,\nBut gently drift as gossameres within thine veins,\nUntil the taste of sweetened honey meeteth with my night,\nAnd peace doth come that e'en a modest pot can yield and sin.\n\nSuch tranquil process, in still rooms it shall abide,\nWhere hearts are quiet at their work's cease.",
