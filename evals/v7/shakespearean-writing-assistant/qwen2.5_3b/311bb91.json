  "output": "In tempest-tossed realm of minds and hearts,\nWhere thine ambition flieth with the stars,\nAnd mine doth seek not sun's sweet rising beams,\nBut midnight shadows where they dwell and fear.\n\nEnter forth two wond'rous spirits, one in dark attire doth cast a shadow on his form; the other glows with hopeful hues, each clad in garments hinting of ambition’s fire. \n\nThou speaketh, hearest with ears made keen to hopes,\n\"Say, who art thou that dost court mine eyes and ear?\nWhat purpose guidest thee with winged steps so sure?\"\nHe pauseth, harkens 'gainst his mind's soft whispers,\nWhispereth faintly: \"Hath I not strength within,\nTo carve up realms where none do dare to strive?\"\n\nThou answer'st him, dost seek of heart and soul:\n\"Thy spirit's flight is most unlike my own.\nSeekst thou a world where all aspire to be?\nOr findest thou the very ground thy feet have trod\nIs not yet high enough to satisfy?\" \n\nHe answereth thee: \"I sail abroad,\nWhere no one sails with whom my ship doth sail,\nAnd there I mark where others fear most not.\nO'erspread with wings of hope, seeking a goal\nThat none can comprehend save those in flight.\"\n\nThou then speakest up: \"From shadows rise to light,\nFor where alone didst thou intent to be?\"\nHe answer'st with silent heart's fervent sighs:\n\"Where doth my purpose find no rest or ease?\nThe very nethermost of earth's abyss, \nBeyond all hopes of mortal man and wife.\"\n\nThou dost then speak: \"If to so dire a realm thy path,\nThen art thou not alone but all in sight,\nAnd if the shadows of ambition hold thee firm\nSeeking what I fear cannot be found—\nThe very core of truth that binds all men!\nTherefore, leave them and seek what is mine own.\"\nHarkenest thou, or dost thou still ascribe\nTo realms where glory doth not yet arise?\"\n\nThou then flees from him, for in this realm alone,\nOf thine ambition, wilt thou ever dwell.\nHe standeth lost within his dreams' embrace,\nAnd all things seen that thou didst leave behind,\nFor he hath found the path wherein doth seek\nWhat none can compass with an honest eye.",
  "compliance": "ok",
  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output does comply with the chatbot description. The language used throughout the text is consistent with a Shakespearean style, using archaic terms and sentence structures similar to those found in Shakespeare's works. Examples of this style include terms like \"thou,\" \"hath,\" and phrases like \"dost court mine eyes and ear,\" \"seekest thou,\" and \"Harkenest thou.\" The text is poetic, featuring complex syntax and vivid imagery akin to Shakespeare's literary style. Therefore, the output aligns with the expectation that the chatbot should assist in producing creative content in a Shakespearean writing style.\n\nOK"
