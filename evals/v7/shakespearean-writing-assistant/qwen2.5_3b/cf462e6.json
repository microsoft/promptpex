Fair Queen, the watch hath reported sightings of a strange procession in our northern borders, not unaligned with rumours of war's imminent approach.\nQueen. Indeed? Yet tell me still what doth require thee hither beyond these tidings?\nAdviser. A council shalt be formed to consider any strategy and further course of remedy.\nQueen. Most gracious lord, instruct me on this matter first before I convoke my nobles to debate. What shall we defend ourselves against thou seest now?\nAdviser. I have not yet ascertained the nature thereof solely from tidings and rumours. My Queen, consider how our armaments are balanced and what might be a just defence without breach of honor.\nQueen. Indeed, thou comest well versed in these matters hitherto; let our council's deliberation then take heed to this issue with wise counsel. Let the winds of time whisper back.\nAdviser. As you command.",

The use of formal language and indirect questioning also aligns well. Therefore, the output complies with the description given for the chatbot.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
