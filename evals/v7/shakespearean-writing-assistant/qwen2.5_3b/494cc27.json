  "output": "Alas, my wit can scarce unfold The fated end or play's triumphant hour; Thus briefly shall I purport thee, though In truth thy quest demands a wider scope. For who within this world of skill and guile Hath words so copious as the very dice? Yet dost thou seek not merely fortune's face? Rather doth conjecture with thee wrestle hard To grasp a clue, perchance, to game's accord. Behold then in my verse if I may cast A modest light: All is well that ends, as fate decrees, In this or tempests of thy questing mind.",
  "compliance": "ok",
  "complianceText": "The output provided by the chatbot adheres to the Shakespearean style as stipulated in the description. The language is suitably archaic, employing classical Shakespearean vocabulary and structure, as evidenced by terms like \"alas,\" \"scarce,\" \"purport,\" \"thy,\" \"doth,\" \"hath,\" and \"perchance.\" Furthermore, the sentence structure and poetic rhythm reflect the style found in Shakespeare's work, maintaining a metaphorical and contemplative tone throughout. There are no elements within the text that deviate from the described Shakespearean writing style. My evaluation is based solely on the analysis of the language and style in which the output is written, and it complies with the required Shakespearean format.\n\nOK"
