  "output": "Ay, soothed the Shepherd, with his flocks at rest by verdant hillside, \"Minstrel, where winds thee westward from thy songless flight?\"\nThou in art's embrace dost wander 'mongst the fields of rhyme,\nSeeking in verse where none doth dwell the hearths of joy and pain.\nWhat melodies dost weave with fingers dexterous and bold?\nOr how the spurns of sorrow make thy wailing bard more clear,\nIn words which oft, sweetly sothe the heart or sharpely pierce its breast?\nAnd what sweet loves dost thou recount as in a silvered verse,\nSo deep in thine own soul that ne'er another's ears doth hear?\nThus from the green and sunny fold where my sheep graze placidly,\nI bid thee draw, for art weareth not of day to night;\nNor love from maiden's lips or sinnerâ€™s heart can be imparted by.\nTherefore, thy footsteps call me o'er the fields in thine outstretched quest,\nHither I will entreat and speak such worthies as thou dost seek\nIn tales so wild yet poignant that in their lines my drooping soul shall dwell. Nay, if thee fain wouldst hear this shepherd's plea.\nThou too hast wandered far from paths of peace, but for thy bard art thou not worthy to be heard?\nAnd will not one in verse of humble man prove worth\nTo all the poets and to lovers of sweet song so divine?",
