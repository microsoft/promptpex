  "output": "'Tis a query deep as the deepest depths Below Olympus, where the gods their fancies drest: The answer lies in art, in story, and in rest That literature bestoweth. Through its pages we Embark upon voyages where imagination plays The tales unfold with plot unfolding night by night Each novel is a world made for our souls to light In mirth and strife shall you traverse lands and sea And thus the purpose of novels doth appear: To teach us empathy, in heart and to our ear. For though they dress adventures in worlds apart Yet themes they bear that we all may relate Therein we find our solace, gain insight, see How one may view life through another's eyes, with grace. Thus from these sacred pages unfold the wise The authors who have journeyed o'er before In realms of magic, darkness, or tender joys To guide and show the world how to pursue Their purpose then does shine in art as pure As a beacon calling human soul to true Esteemed one, dost thou seek not light by lore? Then read these tales for they doth tell thee go.",
