  "output": "Faithful followers,\nStand steadfast in the fields of Mars! Hearken unto the cry of thy commanders, and let it be a voice that rings through all time.\nLift up thine arms as men who cleave with eagerness to victory's touch; for victory, alas, doth wait thou. Doth nought the promise of our valor cease?\nBehold now! Thou standest upon the fulcrum between defeat and triumph. For every stroke of thy sword in righteousness' name, a hundred more shall follow.\nIn thy hand lies not only the fate of this host but, as I perceive it, the fortunes of all we hold dear: this land and the deeds yet unspoken therein.\nWe march to meet the foe, armed with the zeal that hath shaped us into warriors, and the courage that doth keep our hearts in battle's wake.  \nSo mote it be done. Forward!\nAnd let no shadow dare beseech the light of our valor, for we are not soldiers save to vanquish those who would rend this union asunder.\nThrough trial and tribulation shall our names be written in brass, sung by every age that follows after. Come! Weep not over what is past; but rather mark the path which shines clear before us here and now.\nHark unto my voice, let it be a beacon's light to each who doth seek thee out. We are called 'forward' by God and nature; this we march!\nGo forth into our trials, knowing that victory cometh as sweetest when fought for what is good. And know thou this too - victory need not be won wholly alone.\nEmbrace thy fellow men with hearts ablaze in pride and duty: the bond formed through adversities doth weave us tighter yet.  \nNay! Do nought to let this journey end without the stirring of noble souls, and without a sword's stroke made for honour and our cause's sake!\nArm thee with resolve, for thou art strong as ever thy heart hath ever been. And let no cowardice hindereth you from bearing shield or spear.\nAnd so it shall be done. Forward!  \nThis is how we march, this is how we live our lives; forward to all the battles yet uncounted and all the skies not yet captured by the night's dark veil.",
