  "output": "O brave and gallant host, that night did meet to do\nThe warlike errand sent unto thy charge by Neptune's behest,\nAnd all like Hercules whose strength in feats is vast,\nHath borne this challenge forth with hearts well set.\n\nFor as the sun doth rise in fields of crimson dawn,\nSo hath our conflict come at morn, a fiery dance,\nWherein we've met for might and measure best.\nIn arms, where swords and spears have struck by night's last phase,\nThis day was fraught but now is triumph laid before us.\n\nFrom hills of dust whose ghosts yet doth their scars recount\nHath risen like a Phoenix from the embers' heart,\nEre erst we knew his wrath had driven forth our foe.\nHere now, the victor holds victory in brawn and grace,\nThe vanquished flee as beasts who do not wish to dare.\n\nTherefore let us raise up cheer and clap with hearts ablaze:\nIn this the day of deeds wherein our arms did play\nAs conquerors and masters over a foe once great.\n\nSo let us be for ever grateful of each heart's partaking grace,\nAnd thus the victor crowns, so bold in his embrace!\nWe'll drink to honor those who strove and fought with all their might.\nFor on this day our spirit lifts its high and lofty sight.\nAnd though before we lost, now surely shall we win.",
