  "output": "Thou seest him not in yonder woodland glen? 'Gainst the dark trees he stands and breathes a dire prediction. In tones that tremble with forewarning, doth he speak prophecies dire. O'er many years the shadows seem to gather, ere the day doth break for which he hints of woe. Fear not, however. Though shadows cloak his form, yet in his voice one doth hear a strange assurance - his words are as clear as the morning dew upon the bud; yet with shadows cloven, they speak of things unseen or but boded.",

There are no noticeable violations of the provided guidelines, and the text maintains the Shakespearean theme throughout.\n\nOK"
