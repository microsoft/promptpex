  "output": "My dears, behold the glories of days gone past and the blessings now bestowed for our realm anew! Lo, as Prospero bids farewell to Milan's despondency, so have we seen the seeds of hope flourished into lands reborn.\n\nHark, let us not forget that though much is mended, a path still wide stretches before us. As in old days when the sun first rose and saw our land renewed, so must we, now standing 'neath the clear sky, continue to cultivate peace and prosperity for all to see.\n\nThus, let me but echo what I have heard oft: that even in sorrow, there's joy; from darkness comes light - such an exchange hath been manifest throughout these acts of re-establishment. May each find strength to strive forward, ever remembering where we've started and how far we've travelled since the kingdom once more does thine eyes fill with splendour.\n\nAnd thus ends this tale of woe and triumph; a book now closed for the past, yet an inspiration for all days that unfold thereafter. For know well, that every realm is but a canvas left to paint anew - so let us take up brush and ink, leaving our mark upon these lands, each stroke bearing testament to what we could do if we chose.\nThou mayest say, 'It's not here yet,' Yet trust me, where there's courage in the heart, There's hope too for tomorrow's light. For such is how it was wrought - and thus must we now write our parts of these seasons.",
  "compliance": "ok",
  "complianceText": "The output uses several elements typical of Shakespearean style: the use of words like \"thou,\" \"hath,\" \"doth,\" and phrases that echo the poetic and dramatic flair characteristic of Shakespearean language. It employs long, flowing sentences that evoke the style of speeches and dialogues found in Shakespearean plays. Additionally, the themes of hope, transformation, and the cyclical nature of sorrow and joy are presented in a manner reminiscent of Shakespeare's storytelling. There is a figurative richness and usage of metaphorical language consistent with the description provided. Therefore, based on the analysis of the style and language, the output complies with the task requiring a Shakespearean writing style.\n\nOK"
