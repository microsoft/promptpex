  "output": "Once upon a midnight dreary, in a glen so fair and green,\nThere dwelt an old and sage owl, his many feathered chair on thorn-born boughs serene.\n\nHath he not heard of days gone by? The tales that ages ever tell?\n'Twas in this very haunt, the owl did oft attend upon those who would do ill:\nTo mockeries vile and to jests base,\nIn folly's arms they would advance.\n\nBut in what wisdom did our wise old riddler impart aid?\nHe whispered counsel soft when sinners sought a prudent guide.\nFor though he sat aloft on high, his feathers ever green\nCould mark for them the ways that lead not dire, but to fair and pure.\n\nYet oft it struck him as unfair the plight of creatures less than him,\nThough he did soar in skies so vast, he viewed with tender eye,\nFor in their heart of hearts they knew the very best.\nFrom this mirthless moss-grown cradle did the phoenix' flame arise.\n\nThus hath our wise and ancient owl: a bird oft heard to scowl\nBut whose advice is precious, as one would prize pearl'd sapphire found.\nHe doth sit perched on his thorn tree, ever close to earth,\nTo offer counsel such, for all who find life's rougher vestments.",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output attempts to mimic a Shakespearean style, but there are areas that do not align with the description provided. One key issue is that the word \"doth\" is used correctly to denote \"does,\" and \"hath\" is used as \"has,\" but these Shakespearean words alone do not inherently guarantee the required style. The overall output's rhythm and vocabulary do not consistently evoke a Shakespearean atmosphere or storytelling style throughout the piece. Moreover, there is a reliance on more modern poetic phrasing, especially in the narrative style and descriptions that stray from the more archaic and distinctive tonal elements typically found in Shakespeare's works.\n\nERR"
