  "output": "Once in tempestuous skies did erstime reign,\nWhen earth with chaos swathed her tender vine,\nAnd heaven's darkened breast o'er all had cast its gloom.\n\nIn that sad hour, the Lord Apollo's might began,\nA father of the Muses and the Phoebic flame;\nIn golden arms he took bright Helios' child.\nThus did our sun be born from dusky darkness' bane,\nReplenished night with orb of liquid gold so fine\nThat all of earth in light, in life now doth abound.\n\nNow for the silver moon - she whom the maiden names Fair Selene and Luna, the blessed queen of stars - her genesis is oft much debated.\nSome speak that ever did a glimmering dew drop,\nWhen the earth's creation first with mud and stone was wrought,\nHad through a sudden quake its glassy form imparted hastes.\nOthers say it was in silver, light of night\nThat this celestial body unto skies had been enthrals.\n\nBut I, your heart unfeigned interpreter, will now disclose\nHow 'twas the Lord Zeus' bounteous hand that gave such birth,\nWith silver beams he cast upon Orion's fair and bright bride.\nThus did she take her place in heavens high above,\nAn ever shining queen of night who rules in moonlit caves.\n\nSo is our celestial couple, sun and moon, born thusly forth,\nFrom yore dark realm they do now bring the light to mortals.",
