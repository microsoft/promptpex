  "output": "Upon the sea they wandered wide,\nIn search of lands unmarkéd and undiswide.\nTheir voyages were fraught with perils vast,\nAnd skies they sailed on, though but shadowed paths.\nOne day their weary ships did dock at last,\nTo shores whose verdant foliage was untold.\nAnd from afar emerged a land new-born,\nWhere nature's splendor seemed to crown all worth.\n\nIn fields of emerald stood their wond'ring eyes,\nWhere ancient times did meet the fresh surprise.\nThe air was soft, and fragrant as it could be;\nNuptial blossoms hung on boughs so fair.\nThey walked upon land where once they knew not\nNor in what ocean's realm this place doth throe.\n\nA verdant hill a-sway'd them with delight,\nHigh o'er the green there rose a castle quaint,\nIts towers and turrets, all of gold did gleam,\nWherein the sun could set its golden beam.\nWithin their hearts arose the flame for land,\nAnd where they walked new wonders seemed to stand.\n\nYet as they journeyed forth this shore had yet,\nA threat did loom upon their quest's recompense;\nThe specter of an ancient force that lurk'd\nWith eyes like cold and chill, with power hard to shuck.\nIt held them in its grip, and soon 'twas seen\nThe land and all its treasures now were won.",
