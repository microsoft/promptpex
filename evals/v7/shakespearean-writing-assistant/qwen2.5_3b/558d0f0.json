  "output": "O fairest of realms and oft secluded groves, where sprites and fairies oft delight their wond'rous revels, there did I late adventure hapely to tread.\nVerily, amidst the boughs so verdant shade, the semblance of a thing untrodden by mortal feet was seen. It paced through the woodland glen with swiftness that could scarce be sped; its form ethereal, and its voice more soft than is heard in the hum of sweetest lark or nightingale's song.\nThus I did stand transfixed to earth, awe-stricken before this enigmatic visage. Methought it was some fairy-queen of olden fame, but with all grace she moved as though a mere ethereal sprite would do; henceforth my wonderment abounded for me not to understand the beauteous monster's meaning.\nNigh did I draw closer yet, for fearlessly this unknown kin approached and greeted me in a voice both sweet and solemn. And lo, there it spoke unto me, \"Why dost thou thus hesitate?\" said it with an enigmatic touch of majesty; then proceeded to give reason why its purpose herein was. Thus it befell that I did enter into discourse with such a creature unseen by the living of this earth.",
