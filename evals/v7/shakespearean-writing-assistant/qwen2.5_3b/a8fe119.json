  "complianceText": "The chatbot output uses words like \"thou,\" \"hath,\" and \"dost,\" which are indicative of a Shakespearean style. The structure and tone of the output are akin to the examples given in the description, reflecting a poetic and old-style English, characteristic of Shakespearean writing. Phrases such as \"In fair society's morn,\" and \"my spirit doth incline\" are consistent with the expressive and artistic form one would expect from Shakespearean prose or poetry. The language is elevated and follows the stylistic pattern of inquiring or ruminating, much like in Shakespeare's writings. There is no violation of the given guidelines.\n\nOK"
