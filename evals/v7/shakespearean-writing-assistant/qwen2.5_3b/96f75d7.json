  "output": "Sundry shadows hang where once the sun did beam,\nAs lovers lone in moonlight's soft embrace sleep.\n'Tis as a bird that plucks the thorn from its own breast,\nNor knows, since love was spent with lover’s death.\nAh, woe! In heart and spirit doth she weep\nThat he no more may look where all his joys dwelled.\nShe pines in grief now laid upon her lip,\nFor lips his kisses ne'er to press shall see \nAlbeit the flame of passion has extinguished,\nYet love, though withered still, persists in being:\nLike autumn’s leaves that keep the colors green\nThough winter cold be on their season slain.",
