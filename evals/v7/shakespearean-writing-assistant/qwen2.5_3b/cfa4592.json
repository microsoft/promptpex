  "output": "Noble mariner, if by the stern of Neptune thou art questing,\nThou wouldst fain shield thyself from billows and blight. Verily, I offer thee this wondrous charm:\nUpon a lobe where once did seawater wash,\nCarve then this magic phrase: So mote it be!\nThat which is said against thee shall not come true.\nFor on each side, engraver's hands will leave their hue,\nA heart above a ship below. Herein dost thou confide\nThy voyage's end and perilous life at sea.\nUpon this token dost thou rely to prove,\nSafe passage under stars above the skies above thee.\nTis but a token for his time at large on waterâ€™s course,",
