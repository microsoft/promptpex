  "output": "Ay, fairest of nights, when silvered beams doth dance with mirth And in thy glory does the silvan sky revere, In such fair sight doth I desire to partake The feasts and fellowship that hath been prepared For those whose bountiful hearts seek the celestial cheer Of moonlit harvests. Let us raise a cup That doth unite both revelry and repose, And let our songs on silver'd aires with joyous moan Rejoice in autumn's bounty when she dost bestride The fields of earth to bring fruits that dole not pine To gluttony who partake of earthly mien. For this the harvest moon hath called us forth In her bright light to give thanks and bless our board And bind together, all as one so vast In this fair union wherein both body and heart Hasteth toward abundance's sacred task. Thus let the feast commence Where fruits are bounteous and good cheer abound And in such revelry as we embrace Shall nature's bounty doth us faithfully embrace.",
