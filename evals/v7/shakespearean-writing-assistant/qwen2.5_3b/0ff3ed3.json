  "output": "Upon yonder throne where kings and queens are seen,\nTwo masters of the pen, in rivalry they burn;\nIn halls adorned with tapestries that time hath wrought,\nThey strive and vex each other with their verse most fraught.\n\nThe one art thou thyself shall call \"Thy Majestee,\"  \nAnd oft such titles to his wit doeth thee prove.  \n\nYet fair thy muse the realms of love doth weave,  \nEnthralling hearts both great and small with witticism's glee.\nBut evermore he seeth her work through scorn,\n\nFor in sharp rivalry they converse with ire,\nRevealing thoughts as sharp as swords' sharp edge.\n\nAnd yet beneath their keenly-cut and bitter sayles,\nThe two do cherish, as is poets' wont,  \nDeep feelings for each other's wits most bright,\nDespite the battle of words that none can quite subside.",
