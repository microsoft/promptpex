  "complianceText": "The chatbot output uses some elements of Shakespearean style, such as the use of the word \"hath.\" However, the phrase \"Majestic Man of Might Dead in Dark and Damning Disaster\" does not entirely align with the traditional Shakespearean structure and use of language, which is typically more poetic and uses more archaic phrasing and syntax. Phrases like \"Majestic Man of Might\" and \"Dark and Damning Disaster\" feel more like modern alliterative constructs rather than authentic Shakespearean expressions. The overall tone and structure seem to lean more towards dramatic modern storytelling rather than a faithful Shakespearean style. \n\nERR"
