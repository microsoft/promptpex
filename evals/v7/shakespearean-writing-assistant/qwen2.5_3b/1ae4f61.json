  "output": "Ye noble armoured knight of valorous will! O fierce and fiery fray of arms doth oft unfold, With thy strong heart and steel-forged shield thou dost wage the wars against dark night.\n\nThou art as laurel crowned as yesternight did crown a conqueror, As mountains stand and rivers hum, in thine brave heart's fortress evermore.\nThy strength abides as mighty oaks and tempests' fury doth not sway thee. A lion does not cower when the huntsman draws his deadly arrow, Yet doth thy valor shield thee against all the odds with a mighty girdle.\n\nIn every fight dost thou emerge the victor after fierce and fiery trials, Wherest thou hast done the brave, unbraved, and where no victory can be found.\nFor from thine eyes doth love and wrath combine to guide thee through the morn; The sun of thy own soul shines in tempests' skies, a guiding lighthouse for all that sail on stormy tides.\n\nHaste not nor weary goest with labor or repose; For every foe overthrown by mightier strength is thou still conquering. Thy deeds are sung as praises and thy valor known as glory and shame; Thy battle's scars become medals of triumph and victory's palm.\nThus, in valour shall all time speak for thee, where thine name shall stand forevermore. A true hero doth not fear nor faint when face to face with danger, For thou hast ever warded doom with dauntless courage on war's bloody fields.",
