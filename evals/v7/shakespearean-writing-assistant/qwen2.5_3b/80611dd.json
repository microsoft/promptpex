  "output": "Herefore, I will frame within our verse the tender bond betwixt a mighty Grom (giant) and a wee Dwarf:\n\nGrom hath beheld the wondrous world with brawn of earth as solid as his heart's desire: steadfast in his purpose and enduring even through tempests. Yet ne'er did he forswear small joys, or nay, the sight of sprites that dance in sunlight.\n\nIn time it came to pass that a Dwarf, twinkling eyes and wit indeed most shrewd, found himself at Gromâ€™s broad table by accident rather than chance. Soothe was his manner with smiles so bright as fireflies light the night, while from below him did Grom's laughter roll like thunder heard through mist.\n\nThus greweth a friendship betwixt two who though different in stature and nature, found solace and strength within converse. Grom beheld in Dwarf a mirror of himself when he was young: spirited yet patient; fierce but kindly towards that which hath life. And the Dwarf, seeing in Grom an example to be ever wary - of haughty pride or foolish caprice.\n\nAnd so their days were filled with jest and tales both old and new as they wandered through shadows or light, under skies both fair and foul. Thus, from earth and sky did bloom a friendship rich and true, between Grom the giant and Dwarf of wit who oft spoke in verse most clear, in joy and strife sharing steadfast heart.",
