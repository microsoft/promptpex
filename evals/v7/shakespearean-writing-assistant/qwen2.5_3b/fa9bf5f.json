  "output": "In this shadowed abode where ghosts do whisper, the walls of the dread keep hold their ancient sorrow, as shadows dance upon the doors that once have barred. Ghoulish echoes chime in the empty halls, silent servants bearing ghostly sighs; the windows streak with tears as spectral specters pace. Upon the hearth is lit a fire long extinguished, still giving off an eerie glow, which pierces through the gloom and hints at otherworldly presences feasting upon the darkness. What perils doth this castle harbor within its haunted heart?",
