  "output": "In sleep's enchanter circle did such phantasms arise as oft in visions doth attend, sweet dreams of wakened thought: A seraphic being with wings vast and fair, and of unblemished visage came, like him who from celestial bower doth descend to earth. Beside a glade where naiads sing and sprites do dance, his presence seemed like a sacred breeze upon the scene, filling my hearteth with wondrous glee.\n\nA sylphin maidens didst accompany this majesty of form, their silken garments woven from spun light, they swarmed around like fairies flit. Together we traversed realms where forests lush and gardens bountiful stand, a realm untouched by mortal sight nor harshest winter's frost. We spoke in tongues that didst not comprehend, for therein did truth most oft doth lie.\n\nOft have I dreamt of places far where wights of wondrous lore dwell; yet never so did my mind's eye receive as I beheld these fair and blessed folk. Upon awakening, all remained but echoes thereof, the dream a gift from realms beyond the mortal ken. May this muse of fancy guide me well in waking thoughts, to ponder dreams that doth enchant and draw one far from earthly strife.",
