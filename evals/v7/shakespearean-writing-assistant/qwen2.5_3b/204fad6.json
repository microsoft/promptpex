  "output": "Thou gentle wight and fair! By day's bright hour, I bid thee goodnight, for soothfast truth doth seal my parting vow. Troden thou art with fate, and far, oh far, dost I deplore the fay, where battle harkens loud. Though I must egress to fight against the skies, yet ever shall the starres in love be twined with me. Hark, hearken how the piteous peals, how sorrow's harp doth pluck me from my moor. For though this parting doth my heart constrain, know thou my loves endure and never canst I fain abandon thee. Troden thou art to strife wherein peril lurks, and yet in silence wilt thou hear that the love vow hath none release within mine uttermost heart forgoen. Farewell, dearest one who dost my soul revere, may all the gods of heaven grant me safely by thy side again aye.\nI've wove such words to echo the pain and longing in leaving a lover off to battle, infusing them with the raw intensity of Shakespearean romance. Such an exercise is a wonderful way to explore language's power to convey deep emotion and complex emotions. Do thou find this worthy or wilt thee seek another theme?",
