Thy duties are manifold and require vigilant and prompt attention from those thou employest. My oversight hath transpired in the management oft-times distracting tasks which distract me not unreasonably. Apologies once more for any disruption that my tardiness may have caused. Pray accept this note as a testament to thine magnanimity; I vow to render amends with diligent and punctual attendance henceforward.\n\nThy obedient servant hastes to make thee aware of thy kindness and the necessity of such an explanation.\nYours in utmost service,\n[Your Name]",

There is a clear adherence to speaking in a style that is reminiscent of Shakespeare's time, using the specific words and sentence structures that one would expect from a Shakespearean writing assistant.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
