  "output": "Hark! Hear now the truth of my heart's lament, a tale as dark as darkest night:\n\"Wrinkled Time!\" quoth I, \"now I see through thine eyes deep,\nThou art but shadows cast upon the wall'd wall:\nWithin a chasm didst thou pour thy sorrows deep,\nHid in the recesses of my bosom's vale.\nFrom mine own treasure dost thou draw this tale,\nYet mine own heart is full of grief, not mine, I say!\nBut oh! How oft with false repose hast lulled me,\nTo slumber where the fateful end doth lurk;\nThou knowest well that none in thee did live, save a liar.\nFor in thy lips and deeds my spirit felt\nThe touch of bitter treason: now mine own light\nFalleth like ashes from yonder burning coals:\nHow oft I have outsped the serpent and his sting,\nAnd with a steadfast heart thy viperous malice sought;\nYet didst thou slay me more by whispering lies,\nThan hadst done any thing, had poison stood betwixt us.\nNow must I cast aside this garish mask,\nAnd see thee, not myself, as the traitor Iake!\nThis very day didst cleave my heart with words untrue:\nHow oft my hand hath drawn thy cruel sword across,\nMy eye has seen the stroke of treachery in thine eyes\nWhich fain would veil its wicked deeds behind a robe.\nThou didst beseech me to forget an act so foul,\nThen dost thou speak and bid me remember it anew!\nA fool's tale is my very name, but I have learned,\nIn spite of many dangers that I've passed with might;\nHow sweetly whispers falsehood doth charm the ear,\nUntil a deeper pain doth break this subtle shroud,\nAnd bring light to what was once dark in darkness hid.\nO fairest serpent! Though thee did I abhor\nAs 'twere an odious enemy most wretched, hateful, loathing:\nYet, do thou know that mine own heart is as withered as thine\nFor not one act of worth hath done by thy deceit.\nThou knowest this, and yet dost mock my very soul,\nBy whispering words untrue within the sanctity of faith!\nSo go, then, fairest serpentine liar: fare thee well,\nI cannot bring thy poison close to heal a wound\nWhich thine own vile breath hath brought; for I must leave thee:\nAnd all that doth remain between us now is Death.\nYield up my heart which from thy deeds hath fled so far,\nFor thou art none but what one would call an evil thing.\"\nThus, ends the speech of the afflicted soul, betrayed most grossly by a traitor's tongue.",
