  "output": "Sirs,\nWherewithal shall we commence our discourse upon the theme of lovely? Know ye not, that love, being but another name for Cupid's passion, hath been oft debated by philosophical and learned men?\nFirst Speaker:\nLoveliness be it known is a virtue which doth engender both sweetest pleasures and tempestuous desires. It maketh things fair seem more so; what is not lovely at all, dost thou call 'fair' hast thou no heart? It bindeth as with bands of iron in marriage, yet flays when separation cometh nigh.\nSecond Speaker:\nLovely doth indeed connote a state of ardor and fondness. But it suffereth also from the curse that is jealousy, wherein lovers are like to hungry wolves on unbound hunt. Howe'er, this notion of lovely hath not escaped criticism in its conflation with Cupid's sway, which oft times leadeth us away from the substance.\nAudience:\nAh but doth not love, in thee, thyself, and all thine intertwinings, create a tapestry so complex and beautiful, wherein the nature thereof cannot be wholly untangled by such simple labels?\nFirst Speaker:\nTrue it is, fair speaker, to call my discourse merely Cupid's love. Yet in this very simpleness lies a kernel of truth, wherein 'lovely' doth become the common language to which many of us must make obeisance.\nSecond Speaker:\nAnd yet loveliness becometh a beacon within human experience, pointing our towards admiration and the pursuit of what we deem fair, but it also serveth as a mirror reflecting onto self-judgment’s most candid forms. Thus it behooved that in this argument shall we seek to untangle whether lovely doth lie at the apex of our emotional spectrums or perhaps even beneath them.\nAudience:\nIndeed, if thee take to heart these matters thus spewed forth and debated, then may you see a fullness of love's complex nature, both beautiful and troublesome. For it is thyself whom thou loveth who dost fashion this discourse with both hands.\nFirst Speaker:\nSo oft the question harkens back to our very essence, wherein does loving fit in? Second Speaker,\nThen do we admit that Cupid’s flame may be a seed of all things lovely about us and what surrounds?\nAudience:\nAnd yet what folly cannot lead thee astray, thus let us ponder if it be not even loveliness itself which hath bred the very notion, and therefore the debate.\nFirst Speaker:  \n'Tis an interesting premise indeed, dear audience. For loveliness hovers on a precipice of virtue, wherein its manifestation is but a reflection upon our own perfection's faults and merits alike.\nSecond Speaker:\nAnd we must not forget that in every lovely tale there be a measure by which man doth judge himself through others’ eyes.\nAudience:  \nThen let us embrace this interplay with all hearts towards understanding, knowing that loveliness is but an endless weave of beauty upon our very existence.",
