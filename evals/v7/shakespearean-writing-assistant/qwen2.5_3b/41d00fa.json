  "output": "Loquacrative as the early morneth dew Which kisseth every herb and herby knower, Hath bathed itself in silvery beams of sun, Illuminateth fields with golden frowneth; A gentle touch it lendeth to each tree, As though it stroked them softly through a screen. In this fair town's lowly hamlet set, The light creeps forth beneath the thatch√©d roofseths, And batheth in its rays th' humble ydentities, Yea, every cottage and th' humble dwellent, Who hither seeketh peace of worldy care, Hath morning glories to their walls assigned, That they may smile beneath this amaranthine light. Thus setteth forth the dawn, in serenity, A quiet village bathed in gentle grace, The sun's benign eye dooth watch and blesseth each, With beams most soft, a golden anthem playeth.",
