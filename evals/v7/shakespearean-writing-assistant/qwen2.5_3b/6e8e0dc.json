  "output": "Once upon a time morn, in high old days gone past, a crown once gazed from royalty's vast thrones, had vanished in mist or light unseen, though many seek did strive their utmost might in search thereof.  \nFor who amongst the land's denizens hath not heard of Cymbeline's crowns so gilded? They speak of gleaming plumes and jewelled bands entwined with gold, this crown they call Elegance, long lost did it in days of old, no trace of where hath shown the way.\nYet now new quest was born anew: a crown must be sought by noble or by humble, bold man or maiden fair, each heart aglow, for glory to restore the realm once more. Thus began their tales and lore with each, they ventured forth into lands unknown, to seek the lost Elegance in hidden glen or city's walls.\nFierce feuds did divide in ancient times, where rivals took by force of sword, the crown itself at war, it was said its power could not be hid from clashing steel. In halls of mighty kings and lords, in shadows dark as ever there is strife, this crown lay hidden away, sought by one with courage bold and wisdom held.\nThus sirs and wench were called to arms once more, both fair and base, seeking the lost crowns, none deemed so worthy but Elegance's claim of old. For years their quest did continue forth, each day brought near enough or far it fell, till at last a sign did show, as clear as silver blade or star in air unclouded night.\nA herald'd call unto the searchers' heart was set upon this fateful day, to mark their path and guide them well, that crown once more they might have seen. So rode each one forth with bold intent, through mountains green or wood where beasts they met did grow, till came a time at last when shadows thin were left and far were all the doubts.\nAnd there upon an island stood in mist entwined, this crown's dark jewel held within its golden form once more gleamed like sun above. Told it was said that in the quest's first hour a mighty lord had died for love prize alone; but his heirs now sought anew, and found the crowns where many felled, and all who would did fall before.\nNow free to reign, as lords and knights they danced upon their new-made throne's gold-plated back, for this crown in every heart was held an unyielding prize of old. Thus doth the tale unfold, when right is sought and wrong at last does know, to find such treasure lost did make them brave it best, and conquer all that once were feared.",
