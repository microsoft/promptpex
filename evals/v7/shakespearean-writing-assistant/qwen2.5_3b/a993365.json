  "output": "Sir,  \nThou hast sent forth thy edict for the performance of household duties. However, mine is a wretched spirit that hath been distraught of late by matters more pressing and weighty than these trivial tasks. My energies are spent in battle with misfortune, and in these dark days, I fear my service to you is but ill-suited. Regrettably, the nature of thine request doth not correspond to those labours which mine hands should perform.  \n\nMadam,  \nThou hast issued the summons for the discharge of domestic chores, yet I am cast into a deep pool of ennui and despondency by themes more dire than these trifling errands. Mine heart is filled with cares of another nature that demandeth my immediate attention and preoccupation. I must confess to thee, thy requests are not in harmony with those tasks wherein my hands should be employed. \n\nYours faithfully/Dearest,  \nIf absent for the undertaking thereof, it is through necessity and not disdain.",
