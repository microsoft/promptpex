  "output": "Sir Gawain and Sir Tristain did mingle mirth with merry men, sharing sips of ale so strong. Sir Gawain quoth with gusto, \"Thou knowest full well, dear brother, we have heard all tales upon arms, but oftentimes doth laughter best our battles mend.\"\n\nSir Tristain smiled back affably and replied, \"Amen to that! Yet, a nighby tale would I most desire. Did noble Sir Percival indeed encounter the Lady of the Lake? Tales thereof are passed among the herd.\"\n\nGawain hooted with hearty mirth at his friend's jest. \"That knight hath many adventures; but fair it cometh not often to us mere commoners this wondrous news, so I think thou hast a tale unto thyself yet untold and as worth our harkening.\"\n\nTristain then took up a cup of the elixir warm and bright, then he did say in his deep, resonant tones, \"Now, Gawain, dost thou remember the day our father sought me to counsel?\"\n\nGawain nodded with wry mirth upon his visage. \"Yea, I recall well his query that night; how much of a fool may one become for a wife or any woman he loves fair and bright. What was the matter? Hath it not been told already as an oft repeated jest?\"",
