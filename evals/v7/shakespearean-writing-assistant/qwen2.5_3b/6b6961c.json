Thine eyes gaze like stars in twilight dim, yet fate's cold steel shall rend us asunder, leaving but a lone sigh to pierce the gloom.\nThou sayest thou art but flowers to my heart's clay; yet, in thy absence, I hang by thorns untaught. Thus doth my soul weep o'er our parting woes like a tempest driven ship cast forth upon an angry sea.",
