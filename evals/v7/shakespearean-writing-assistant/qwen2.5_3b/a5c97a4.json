  "output": "'Night', fair Rosalind; by thine eyes,\nI love thee more than they which doth wear the sun.\n'Twas thou that first didst steal through yonder walls of wall,\nTo bid me gaze upon thy beauty's balm.\nYet Romeo, though I bear thee a fond care,\nThy heart dost seem to harbour fierce dismay,\nBy speaking thus. For now thou hast no need\nOf thine own woe; for if thou wearest grief\nThe heavens doth oft the fairest faces mark:\nSo that thy beauty doth not suffer it.\nFor hush, my love, be silent! Let our lips press,\nAnd let us in this holy place declare\nOur mutual vows. Thou, gentle Rosalind,\nThou art by reason a fairer star than all\nWhich from the sun dost steal away his glory.\nBut more my love shall cause my joyous heart\nTo dance with thee and to do thy will.\nBe silent now, and let us both in peace,\nThe stars' swift light should guide our souls.",
