  "output": "Within the midnight's hallowed domain\nWhere shadows softly whisper tales old,\nAnd blooms luxuriate in silent sighs, there dost unfold\nA secret rendezvous untold\nIn th' enrobing shades of lavender and rose\nWhen whispers of sweet love interlace\nHow Venus hath her bower with nature most ardent close\nBeside the chimes that all the air caress,\nWe blend within the mystic garb of Night's own cloak, doth sheath thee\nWhose very essence in th' enchantment is plenished  \nThat no sight could pierce the veil of love to our meeting true.",
