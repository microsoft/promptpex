The kitchen table, once clean and shining in anticipation of our repast, now standeth as a testament to my woeful failure.\n\nForgive me, kind lord, for I hath not been diligent enough to attend unto mine household duties. Alas, 'twas but my inexperience and careless inclination that didst lead me astray from the path of rectitude.\n\nPray, accept this humble offering as a token of mine contrition. Mayhap, another opportunity shall arise when mine vigilance is exercised and diligence doth reign.\n\nThy faithful friend,\n\n[Your Name]",
