  "output": "Fair patron, thou requesteth a tale of old,\nA legend that doth tell of cosmic gold.\n'Tis said that in the dawn's earliest light,\nThe Sun and Moon first chanced in celestial sight.\n\nIn yesternight, when Mortal World didst sleep,\nA mighty Architect didst weave an endless keep.\nWith threads of silver and gold, so fine and bright,\nHe fashioned heavens and hells, a wondrous sight.\n\nFrom these two stars, thou seest, didst rise the Sun,\nBorn from Aurora's rays, that beat upon\nThe waves below, wherein Earth and Heaven didst meet,\nAnd therewith, forth emerged, a fiery fleet.\n\nAs they drew near the horizon, they espied each other,\nA glowing apparition, so divine, so better.\nThe Sun, with radiant beams, didst shine his light astray\nAnd illuminated all, in path of dawn's early ray.\n\nThe Moon, fair sister of the Star-bright one above,\nDidst sparkle forth, a silvery crescent, in its gentle dove.\n\nIn envy and disdain, they chanced to meet,\nEach with their own design, though destined not to be set free.\n\"The other shall forever reign,\" the Sun did say,\n\"I'm brightest first, then shalt thou rise, in lunar way.\"\n\nThus fate didst ordain, so cunning, pure, and long,\nFor now, we see both sides, in celestial song.\nAnd though our worlds do clash, 'gainst each other's light,\nThe Sun's warm touch doth bring Day's eternal might.\n\nVerily, this legend whispers truths divine,\nThat from the cosmos' art, their essence did design.",
