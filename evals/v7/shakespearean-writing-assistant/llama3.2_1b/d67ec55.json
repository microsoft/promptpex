  "output": "Thou dost request a verbal revelry to ensue,\nIn this humble tavern, where folk do gather round,\nA hushed aside spoken in a murmur'd tone\nDoth spread like wildfire 'round the town.\n\nHere's a conversation that stirrings forth from yonder debate:\n\n**Barkeep:** Hark! Good sirs and madams, gather 'round!\nWhip up some chatter, lest our mugs be empty'd!\n\n**Tavern Wench (Maeve):** Verily, I do declare,\nThis fine ale is pass'd its prime. Methinks it's time\nTo swap the wooden spoons for a lively tune,\nLest we all join in merry revelry anew.\n\n**Bartender (Finnley):** Fie upon thy words, fairest Maeve! Thou dost protest too much!\nYet I'll not be swayed by thine urbane charm. Share\nThis flask and listen to the tales that go round,\nFor in thy wisdom, we may glean a new renown.\n\n**Maeve:** Ah, good Finnley, thou dost seem quite bold,\nThy wit doth shine like silvered moonlight cold.\nI'll humor thee for now, but heed my claim:\nIf 'tis ale no more doth satisfy mine ear,\nPerhaps I must take up the rustic guitar's frame.\n\n**Finnley:** By all that's holy! Thy rife singing shall astound!\nNow if thou wilt be quiet, and not make a sound,\nThe patrons' hearing may catch thy merry strains, anon!\n\n**Tavern Man (Grimgold):** Hear ye, hear ye! Gather 'round this tale,\nA mighty bear didst roam these woods in yore's pale veil.\n\n**Grimgold:** Aye, 'twas said he feasted on berries sweet\nUnder moonlit skies where glades their vigil keep.\nA chase did follow him, till down the stream his roar\nDid echo loud and wilder still, when last he strayed from shore.",
