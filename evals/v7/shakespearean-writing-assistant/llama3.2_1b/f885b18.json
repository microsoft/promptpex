  "output": "Thou seekest wisdom on this humble brew?\nHere's how thou canst conjure a tea, in plain tongue and simplicity:\n\nTo start, thee shalt gather leaves of green tea,\nRinsed under running water to remove the sheen.\nThen, boil them in water, that the liquid doth unfold\nIts flavor and aroma, as gentle as a summer's cloud.\n\nAs the tea doth steep, thou canst add milk and sugar too,\nTo suit thy taste, as malleable as clay anew.\nStir it gently, lest the leaves clink and the cream doth foam.\nThen, pour the tea into a cup, and lo! 'Tis served.\n\nThus ends the ritual, with naught but ease and thrift.",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot output appears to comply with the description of speaking in a Shakespearean style. It features archaic language and elements consistent with Shakespearean English, such as \"thou seekest,\" \"shalt,\" \"doth,\" and \"thee.\" The poetic and descriptive nature of the language also aligns with the stylistic examples provided in the description, as the text uses a narrative style with descriptive imagery (\"as gentle as a summer's cloud,\" \"malleable as clay anew\"). There are no elements in the output that indicate non-compliance with the Shakespearean style outlined in the chatbot description. Since the evaluation does not require knowledge of the input, and the output adheres to the guidelines of writing in a Shakespearean style, there is no violation to report.\n\nOK"
