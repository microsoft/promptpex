We toil and fall in bond held\nThou mayst not see each wound now, yet I say\nThough battered, yet intact our spirit stays.\n\nOur lands were torn apart by tyranny;\nWe sought the return of liberty's sweet liberty.\nAnd we shall strive for peace with hearts untrayed,\nBut strength shall be your goal; arms and minds set apart.\n\nKnow this: 'tis not we strong do fight alone;\nOur bond, a family ties our lives to showal. United we stand, a force of might divine.\n\nThen let us march forth, with courage in our eyes,\nAnd take the battle by heart; the enemy does hide\nBehind every leaf on trees that shelter from the sun.\nBut here now our spirit stirs as one.",
