The tale of two fair maidens, with faces that did surprise.\n\n'Twas once in Verona's sun-kissed streets,\nTwo lasses chanced upon an enchanted seat.\nThey spied a ruddy rose, with leaves so bright,\nAnd thought 'twas Aphrodite's favor on their sight.\n\n\"Thou art as lovely as the morning dew,\" one did claim,\n\"I too would have thy hand – and in thine eyes, I see our hearts' eternal flame.\"\nAphrodite, laughing, replied with merry jest,\n\"My love comes not from beauty, but from heart's true quest.\"\n\nUndeterred by words of her gentle voice,\nThis maiden did confess her innermost choice.\nTo find the rose's secret, she did ask a wise old sage,\n\"Forgive me, fair Aphrodite, who doth this token engage.\"\n\nThe sage, with wit and quick discerning eye,\nAnswered, \"My lass, thou dost mistake me for another high-born sigh:\n'Gainst thou not my love – but true and kind – though not the royal blood of thee?\"\n\nThus both did laugh, in merry amazement's glow.\nAnd so they parted ways – two maidens with a tale to bestow.\n\nTheir hearts now entwined, yet with wits untold,\nDid dance through days and nights, in love's sweet gold.",
