  "output": "A request most fine and dear:\nTo satirize the hapless scribe there,\nWho doth mishandle quills with reckless air.\n\nHis papers flutter, his ink does stray\nAs he attempts to write with steady sway,\nThough oft 'tis spilling across the floor's pale way\nAnd letters scatter'd like a careless hour.",
