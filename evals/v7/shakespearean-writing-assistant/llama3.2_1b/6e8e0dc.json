  "output": "Fair patron, thou dost request a tale most wondrous,\nOf one most noble, a crown lost, its origin unfathomed by all.\n\nIn days of yore, when royalty didst hold court with grandeur fair,\nA royal jewel didst shine bright, upon the monarch's brow, beyond compare.\n'Twas said 'twas forged in ancient lands, where gems didst lie hidden still,\nAnd crafted with the skilled hands of master cutters, who didst imbue it with a gentle will.\n\nThis crown, of gold and gems, a marvel to behold, didst bring great delight\nTo kings and queens, who wore it with resplendent might. But one night, oh woe!\nThe monarch, in the midst of revelry, didst shed the crown, and it was lost forevermore!\n\nAlas! The crown had vanished, leaving naught but memories to remain.\nAnd thus began a quest, most noble, to find the crown that couldst reign supreme.\n\nThou art summoned, brave adventurer, to embark upon this perilous ride,\nTo navigate treacherous lands, and brave the unknown with courage inside.\nFollow in thy wake the trail of breadcrumbs, left by the royal hands once more,\nAnd mayhap thou shalt uncover secrets hidden, 'twixt mountains high and valleys poor.\n\nThou shalt meet a motley crew, a witch and her familiars, who shall aid thee on thy quest,\nTogether ye shall brave enchantments, and trials fraught with perils untold.\nThe witch, with eyes sharp as stars, shall guide thee through dark forests deep,\nWhere mythical creatures lurk, and foul beasts do prowl, with ears that do creep.\n\nAs thou shalt journey through the land of shadow, where the sun doth never shine,\nThou shalst encounter ancient ruins, with secrets locked inside the stone's confine.\nThe wind shall whisper tales of old, in thy ear, like a lover's gentle sigh,\nAnd mysteries 'twill unfold before thee, like a book yet unopened nigh.\n\nBeware the treacherous River Nightfall, where thieves and wolves do congregate,\nLest thou be taken captive by their snares, or left to perish on that unforgiving stage.\nThou art but one step away from thy goal, brave adventurer, still thou dost shine bright.\n\nMay Fortune smile upon thee, noble knight, as thou embarkest this grand adventure true!",
