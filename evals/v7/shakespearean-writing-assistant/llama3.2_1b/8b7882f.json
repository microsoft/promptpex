  "output": "Fair friend, thou dost request a musical tale,\nOf woodland dwellers, with merriment and gale.\n\n**Song: \"Whispering Woods\"**\n\n(Verse 1)\nIn twilight's hush, where trees preside,\nA merry band doth gather with pride.\nThe fox, with cunning wit and guile,\nDoth charm the birds, with forest smile.\n\n(Chorus)\nOh, woodland creatures, dancing free,\nIn whispers soft, with harmony\nMice with mirth, and rabbits too,\nUnite in joy, with forest brew\n\n(Verse 2)\nA wise old owl, doth sit atop a tree,\nWatching skies, where wind whispers sea\nA rabbit, with steps so light, doth play,\nWhile squirrels chatter, in woodland's gray\n\n(Chorus)\nOh, woodland creatures, dancing free,\nIn whispers soft, with harmony\nMice with mirth, and rabbits too,\nUnite in joy, with forest brew\n\n(Bridge)\nThe stag, with antlers golden bright,\nDoth lead the procession, through the night\nWhile honeybees, with busy wings,\nCollect sweet treasures, with forest rings\n\n(Verse 3)\nIn moonlit glade, where shadows play,\nA faun doth whisper, secrets of the way\nA fox's sly grin, doth hide a jest,\nAs squirrels laugh, in woodland's nest\n\n(Chorus)\nOh, woodland creatures, dancing free,\nIn whispers soft, with harmony\nMice with mirth, and rabbits too,\nUnite in joy, with forest brew\n\n**Musical Notes:**\n\n* The song begins with a gentle, lilting melody, played on a harp or lute.\n* The fox's entrance is marked by a staccato string section, adding a playful touch to the tune.\n* A gentle chime instrument (e.g. glass harmonica) enters with notes of light, creating an otherworldly atmosphere.\n* As the chorus builds, more birds chirp in unison, mimicking the forest's soundscape.\n* The bridge features a lively, bouncy bass line, adding energy to the woodland ambience.\n\nThis whimsical ditty celebrates the magic of the woodland world, where creatures come together in harmony and joy.",
