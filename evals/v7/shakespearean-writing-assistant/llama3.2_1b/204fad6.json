May Fortune smile upon our endeavors dear,\nAnd may thy thoughts be filled with comfort and happy cheer.\nI shall return to thee, though lost to mortal sight's brief span,\nAnd in your arms, I long to be, till the bloody conflict's vanquished plan.\n\nMy love, this is not a farewell I chose lightly or hastily made,\nFor my heart doth belong to thine, and with it, all my thoughts are led.\nI swear that on my honor as a soldier true and just,\nTo return to thee, come the end of hostilities, we shall be wed at last.\n\nThine in love and absent arms,\n[Your Name]",
  "compliance": "ok",
  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output adheres well to the described Shakespearean writing style. It makes use of archaic words such as \"thou,\" \"doth,\" \"shalt,\" and terms the style evokes, such as \"farewell,\" \"dearest love,\" and \"valor is put to test.\" The language maintains a poetic and elevated tone akin to what one might find in a play or poem from the Shakespearean era. The structure and form are reminiscent of Shakespeare's works, featuring high emotion and themes of love, fate, and war, common in Shakespeare's time.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
