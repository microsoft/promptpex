  "output": "O, fairest night's dark veil, how thou dost enfold\nMy waking senses in a mystical fold,\nAnd with thy shadows, tales of wonder hold.\n\nIn dreams, I find myself at twilight's hush,\nWhere ancient forests stretch their mystic rush.\nThe moon, a ghostly galleon, rides the trees,\nAnd dragons, phoenixes, and great serpents seize the breeze.\n\nAmidst this verdant landscape, I do chanced\nUpon thy magnificent, wingséd unicorn's presence.\nThy manes, like tresses, flowed in mystic streams,\nAs thou didst toss thy head, revealing starlight beams.\n\nBy Gildorin's light, a dragon, fiery and wise,\nDidst glide upon the lake, where reeds do throng with surprise.\nWith claws that shone like rubies, he didst assail\nThe tender shoots of water lilies on their sway.\n\nA harpy, squire to the goddess Diana fair,\nDoth dance among the stars, her eyes aflame with beauty rare.\nHer songs, a melody of pure delight,\nDidst summon forth a chorus of ethereal sight.\n\nAnd thou, O Muse, thy whispers in my ear\nDidst summon forth a mermaid's haunting peer.\nHer voice, like music, didst entwine my soul,\nAs she conjured forth the secrets of the deep, and made them whole.\n\nThus lost in this fantastical realm of dreams,\nI found myself ensnared by magic's sweet themes.\nFor in thy depths, I saw a mirrored reflection of\nMy own heart's desires, where love, ambition, and courage beckon like a mystic threshold.",
