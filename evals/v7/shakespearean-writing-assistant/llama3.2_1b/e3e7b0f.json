  "output": "O, fairest heart, with secret pain,\nThou holdest in thine breast my love again:\nUnsought and unwelcome as the dew\nThat doth upon the grass bed softly lies.\n\nThy words, they whisper sweet remembrance true\nOf hours we shared, of moments rare and new;\nBut thou, alas, dost not know this feeling's might,\nNor can thy gaze impart to me thy love's pure light.\n\nAs summer's sun doth shine upon the plain,\nAnd brings forth life, in radiant hues of rain:\nMy heart, like autumn leaves, doth wither in vain,\nUnrequited and untouched by thine disdain.\n\nO, then I'll stay afar, a spectator thus,\nTo watch thee move on, with joy or sorrow's bliss;\nBut thou, dear love, dost suffer me to think\nOf thee alone, while I take no step to seek.\n\nYet still I'll hold this secret in my soul,\nThis longing heart of love that doth not find its goal.\nAnd in the silence of this evening's hush,\nI'll whisper vows, unspoken, yet in truth, and thus.",
