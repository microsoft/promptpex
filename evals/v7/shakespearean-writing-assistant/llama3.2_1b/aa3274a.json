  "output": "Dear patron of love and secrecy,\n'Twixt thine eyes and mine, a midnight tryst I shall devise.\nA glade, hidden from the world's eager gaze,\nShall serve as stage for our love's conspiratorial ways.\n\nThe sun doth set, casting long, dark shadows deep,\nWhen mortal hearts are most awake and stealthy keep.\n'Tis here, in this sweet garden of my dreams,\nThat we shall meet, with whispers, soft, and secret themes.\n\nThine arms, so strong and yet, so gentle as a sigh,\nShall enfold me close, and I mine own secret sighs reply.\nThe night breeze stirs not, still and quiet as a stone,\nAs our lips meet in a kiss that all the world is grown unknown.\n\nA thousand midnights hath I spent in idle brooks,\nAnd countless hours, in silent, moonlit walks,\nBut none have compared to this one special hour,\nWhen, with thee, dear love, my heart doth pour out its deepest power.\n\nOh, blessed surprise! 'Tis thou again, and yet no form is seen,\nOnly the magic of our love, like starlight, pure and serene.\nWith every kiss, a secret shall grow strong and free,\nA midnight tryst in this enchanted garden, for thee and me.",
  "compliance": "ok",
  "complianceText": "The output uses the Shakespearean style, with words like \"thine,\" \"doth,\" \"hath,\" \"thee,\" and \"thou,\" conforming to the described style. It also employs a poetic and old-language structure reminiscent of Shakespeare's works. The use of terms such as \"patron of love and secrecy,\" \"midnight tryst,\" and \"enchanted garden\" adds to the Shakespearian theme, creating a romantic and expressive piece. The language flows in a distinctly poetic and rhythmic manner, much like the examples provided in the description. There is no specific rule violation based on the output alone.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
