  "output": "In secret chambers of my heart doth reside,\nA constant flame that festered with desire,\nYet thou, dear love, art not allowed to glide\nInto the warm waters of affection's fire.\n\nThy presence near, a balm to soothe my soul,\nWhereas afar, it burns and withers fast,\nLike autumn leaves that fall from tree to hole,\nCut off from sunshine that once brought them past.\n\nOh, cruel fate, to love in vain, and yet\nTo cherish hope of thee, where none may see\nThe tender yearning in thine eye's caress,\nUntil thou dost respond or flee with glee.\n\nAnd thus I'll leave this secret anguish here,\n\nNote: Shakespearean Sonnet structure is:\n\nABAB CDCD EFEF GG\n\nwhere the first quatrain introduces the theme, the second quatrain develops the idea, the third quatrain provides a turn and leads to the resolution, and the final couplet concludes the poem.",
  "compliance": "ok",
  "complianceText": "The chatbot output complies with the description of speaking in a Shakespearean style. The poem uses archaic language such as \"thou\", \"dost\", and follows a similar form to a Shakespearean sonnet, although it doesn't strictly adhere to the sonnetâ€™s rhyme scheme of ABAB CDCD EFEF GG. However, the task does not require exact replication of Shakespearean forms but rather a style that includes certain words and evokes a Shakespearean feel, which the output achieves.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
