  "output": "Fair sir or madam, thou dost pose a query most simple and profound,\nYet brief as a whispered promise, 'tis answered thus: The sun doth set\nBy reason of its motion, a great celestial sphere,\nBeneath the horizon, it doth decline, in darkness appear.\n\n'Tis but a matter of perspective, a change of day's delight,\nWhen Earth, a glowing globe, hath lost its radiant light.\nThe sun, a burning star, doth sink beneath the sea\nOf night's dark mantle, where its gentle beams no more be free.\n\nThus, as the day doth wane, and stars begin to shine\nIn sky's dark canvas, we behold the sunset's design.\nAnd thus, fair friend, thou seest why sun doth set at day's end.",
