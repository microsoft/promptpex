The language used in the headlines is modern and does not incorporate any Shakespearean elements such as words like \"thou\" or \"hath,\" nor does it reflect the poetic style typical of Shakespeare's works, as described in the examples. The headlines appear factual and straightforward, lacking the stylistic creativity expected from a Shakespearean writing assistant.\n\nERR"
