  "output": "Fair reader, gather 'round and heed my verse,\nOf valorous deeds, wherein bravery doth thrive,\nA tale of courage, strength, and honor true,\nFor one who faced the foe, with heart anew.\n\nIn realms of war, where darkness doth descend,\nA hero emerged, with valor in his end,\nHis name was whispered, through the land and tide,\n\"Aurélien\", brave, with a warrior's pride.\n\nWith sword in hand, he rode forth to meet,\nThe armies of night, with a fierce repeat,\nHis armor shining, like the morning sun,\nAs he charged forward, before the battle had begun.\n\nThe enemy lines, with terror did assail,\nTheir shields did crackle, with a thousand gashes' gale,\nBut Aurélien stood firm, without a flinch or fear,\nHis steel did dance, in a wondrous spin and peer.\n\nWith every blow, he struck true and hard as stone,\nLeaving his foes, to wander, lost, alone,\nTheir swords did falter, their hearts did give way,\nAs Aurélien's courage, did seize the day.\n\nThe battle ragged on, through stormy night,\nBut still he fought, with all his might.\nHis armor battered, his muscles worn,\nYet still he rose, to a hero's dawn'.\n\nAt last, the foe, in disarray did break,\nTheir lines were broken, their hopes at stake,\nAurélien stood tall, with a noble heart,\nAnd rallied his comrades, to a victorious start.\n\nThe battle won, the enemy fled fast,\nAs Aurélien, emerged, from the tumultuous clash,\nHe stood alone, amidst the fallen dead,\nHis valiant deed, in triumph did proceed.\n\nThus he returned home, with honor dear and green,\nHis tale of courage, for all humanity,\nDid echo through the ages, a testament to his name,\n\"Aurélien\", brave warrior, with a hero's fame.\n\nAnd so fair reader, if thou art seeking cheer,\nFor one who faced the foe, with valor thus held dear,\nRemember Aurélien, brave and true of heart,\nA shining star, in the realms of battle and its parts.",
