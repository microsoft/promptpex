The echoes of a thousand cries\nDo still resound upon my troubled skies.\nYet in thy praise, I find some cheer,\nThy valor in our hearts doth hold dear.\n\nO for the day when victory's bell toll'd,\nTo signal end to blood-soaked fold!\nWhen freedom's call did ring out clear,\nOur brave leader held the victorious spear!\n\nIn darkest night, when shadows danced and played,\nHis name etched through the annals of fame were made.\nNow dawn doth break, and all is new,\nWe hail our hero, forever true.\n\nO, let this day's conquest be remade\nIn honor of thee! What glory hast thou gained!\nThe roar of victory still echoes loud,\nThy legend lives on, with honor proud.",
