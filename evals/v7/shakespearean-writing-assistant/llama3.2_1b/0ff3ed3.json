  "output": "O, fairest rivalries that doth entwine\nIn royal courts where verse and power align,\n'Twixt poet Thane of Kent and Earl of York's pride,\nA contest of the quill and lyrical stride.\n\nThane, with lines like flowing summer streams,\nDidst pour out his heart in poems, sweet and warmes,\nWhile York, with words like cutting winter chills,\nTaunted his rival, seeking to dismiss and slim.\n\nThe royal hall, a stage for both to play,\nDidst echo with their verses, each in dismay,\nFor Thane's words didst touch the heart and soul,\nWhilst York's didst mock and scorn, making him lose control.\n\nOne night, in secret, they didst meet beneath\nA moonlit window, where their rivalry would breathe,\nThane spoke of his craft, with passion strong and free,\n\"Oh, how I yearn to hear thy verse, Earl York!\"\n\nYork replied, with scornful words, \"Ah, but thou art slow,\nMy lines are swift as lightning, striking so low,\"\nTheir words didst clash like swords in battle's din,\nAs their rivalry didst fuel the royal court within.\n\nYet still they sought to prove their poetic might,\nEach seeking supremacy, day and night,\nIn courts of glory, love and honor didst entwine,\nAnd Thane and York, with verse, didst define their confine.",
