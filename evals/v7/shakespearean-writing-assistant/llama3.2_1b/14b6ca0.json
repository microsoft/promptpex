  "output": "O, wouldst thou seek counsel on the paths of yesternight,\nWhen fate and fortune did thy heart ignite?\nThen heed my words, dear one, and heed them well,\nLest thou be lost in realms of doubt and spell.\n\nFirst, seek out the company of noble men,\nWhose wisdom doth impart principles true and green.\nSeek out the virtues of solitude and rest,\nFor oft 'tis there that thou dost find thy heart's best.\n\nBe not like pharaohs of old, with thrones and gold,\nBut rather like a humble peasant, with a heart of wood.\nFor when thou art kindled by the fires of love,\nThy passions tempered shall never go unbound.\n\nAnd lo! When darkness gathereth in the night,\nAnd doubts assail thy mind with woeful plight,\nThou shalt recall the words of old wise men's sway:\n\"Hope is like a river, ever-flowing, doth not fade away.\"\n\nSo here's to thee, dear youth, take heed and be,\nTis well that thou dost ask, on these matters of the tree.\nMay truth be thy guide, may wisdom show the way,\nAnd when thou findest self, in its own sweet stay.",
