Let thus unfold the tale\nOf strife within, that doth beset the soul:\n\n**Scene: The Chamber of Regrets**\n\nA maiden fair, with beauty's radiant glow,\nFindeth herself, as night beneath the moon doth shine.\nA love, that once didst burn with fervent fire,\nNow flickers out, like wisps of dying desire.\n\nShe looketh inward, where heart and mind do play.\nHer thoughts do whirl, in chaotic tumultuous sway,\nAs she confronts the doubts that threaten to ensnare.\n\"Why hast thou left me, when love's sweet flames were bright?\nWhat wickedness have I done, that thou didst depart from mine own sight?\"\n\nA pang of guilt doth cut her troubled breast,\nAs memories of joy and laughter pass, and find no rest.\nShe thinketh back on moments shared with glee.\nBut like a fleeting dream, the mirth doth vanish wild and free.\n\n\"O cruel fate!\" she exclaimeth with desp'rate sighs!\n\"As if my love, that once didst light me up, could ever passively lie\nIn thine arms? A mockery, a deceit to the heart?\nIs this the way of things? Do we but play a bitter part?\"\n\nHer mind doth wrestle, struggling for peace,\nAs conflicting emotions in turmoil wildly cease.\nShe searcheth out answers, in a desperate quest,\nYet findeth none, that soothes her troubled unrest.\n\nThus trapped in darkness, lost to sorrow's sea,\nShe longs for release, as hope and joy depart from sight.",
