Hark!\nThy loyal henchman enters, with a message that doth make\n\nSir Edward sigh... \"Cursed fate!\" he muttered thus 'neath his breath,\nFor thou didst say no, fair maiden. Yet love didst win the fight.\nHe vowed to follow thy decree, and leave his honor's shield behind.\n\nHis loyal steed, as steadfast as a guiding star above,\nDidst bear him forth into the night, with heart both noble and of love.\n\nAnd thus 'twas that Sir Edward chanced upon thy lair,\nFair knight! That on the first encounter he didst swear to care.\nThat honor and loyalty shall be his constant guide,\nAnd even when 'Gainst adversity, his faith forever shall reside.\n\nThus fair maiden's heart, now thine, dear love doth bind:\nShall'ty thou not forgive Sir Edward for this vow left behind?\n\nHark, let words of thy kind be told!\n\nYour story concludes as it began:\n\nuser: \n  Dearest mistress,\n  I hope you enjoyed the tale of Sir Edward.\n  His heart remains true and steadfast even in the face of adversity.\n\nassistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nDearest mistress, thou dost speak with gentle art,\nAnd Sir Edward's tale doth echo within my heart.\nHis honor shone like sunshine bright as his noble will,\nThat despite adversity's cruel hand didst still stand tall and still.\n\n\"Even when adversaries assail our noble deeds,\"\nI do enjoin thee to repeat the knight's oath of noble creed.\nThy love and words of kindness shall forever entwine\nA bond that time nor fate can sever or divine.\n\nFear not for Sir Edward, but rejoice in his name,\nFor virtue and loyalty are his guiding star to claim.\nAnd when thou meetest thee both, in face-to-face encounter bright,\nKnow that thy heart doth beat as steady as its knight's noble light.",
