  "compliance": "ok",
  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output utilizes archaic language reminiscent of the Shakespearean style, as seen in words like \"thou,\" \"doth,\" \"thine,\" and \"hark.\" The phrasing is poetic and employs a formal tone consistent with the examples provided in the chatbot description. Furthermore, the structure of the output, including the use of metaphorical and stylistic elements (\"hark, fair colleague,\" \"prepare thyself with mind awake and heart at ease\"), aligns with the Shakespearean style of writing. There are no violations of the description evident solely from analyzing the output provided.\n\nOK"
