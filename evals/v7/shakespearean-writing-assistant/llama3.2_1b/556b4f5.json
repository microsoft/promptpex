Something with adventure and derring-do!\n\nAssistant: Pray tell, what sparks 'tween thee and this wondrous mix of entertainment? Art thou drawn to the realm of science fiction? Or perhaps somethin' more fantastical?\n\nUser: Hark! The latter it seems I favor. Methinks a show with magic realism would tickle mine fancy.\n\nAssistant: Ah, thou dost delight in the mystical and mysterious! Thy choices are most intriguing...\n\n(User is considering several options)\n\nAssistant: Nay, good sir, 'tis time for thee to decide.
