  "output": "Fair tale, thou dost request another's birth.\n\nIn days of yore, when kingdoms stood apart,\nTheir hatred raged like wildfire in the heart.\nThou and thy kingdom, strong as ancient stone,\nHath torn the land with conflicting tone.\n\nThe Red Kings of Eridoria, with pride unbound,\nDidst see their neighboring realm as weak and wound.\n\"Thou dost not know,\" they didst proclaim and say,\n\"To be as great as we, our power shall sway.\"\n\nAnd thou, thy kingdom's proud with similar zeal,\nDidst answer back, with scorn and hostile reveal.\n\"We shall not yield, nor make a peace but slow,\"\n\"I'll burn thy castle, ere the war is woe.\"\n\nTheir armies clashed, their people fought and fled,\nAs death and fire didst dance above the dread.\nBut fate, a curious trickster, didst behold,\nTwo souls, amidst the bloodshed, young and cold.\n\nOne was Erian, son of King Arin bold,\nAnd king's sworn enemy, with heart turned cold.\nHe spied a noble youth, in chariot bright,\nSaid, \"Behold! The fate that brings us to this night.\"\n\nWith cautious eye, they stole away from strife,\nErian and the youthful one, on secret wife.\nThrough forest dark, they made their way of old,\nAnd hid in caves, beneath a winter's gold.\n\nWhen winter's chill didst bite, their love began to grow,\nA flame that lit their past, and shed the hate below.\nIn Eridoria's courts, where war had left its mark,\nThe youth and king didst meet, with hearts that did embark.\n\nSlowly, they spoke, and heard each other's plea,\nTheir words like seeds, that at first were small but soon set free.\nErian saw in young one a love so true,\nA chance to break the chain of hate, anew.\n\nAnd thou? For Eridoria's crown, thy heart didst bend,\nTo make amends for past deeds, and a better friend.\nHast thou not known, what peace doth lie below?\nWhen conflict fades like dawn, and hearts can grow.\n\nThus slowly, like morning dew, their trust didst breed,\nAnd in the end, their friendship took its deed.\nTwo empires merged, their armies laid aside,\nAs Eridoria's kings saw glory in a common pride.",
