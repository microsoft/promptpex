What care I for fate?\nMy heart belongs to thee, and never to another mate.\nCome, let us talk of troubles past, and woes we've known;\nFor thou dost seem beset by woes, and sorrow's dark throne.\n\nKING:\nThou may'st be right, my love, but soft! What noise doth come\nFrom yonder corridor? 'Tis one I've been to seek,\nTo ponder on my fate, and the coming doom.\nHither, wife, come quickly; gather thy fair words!\nWhat thoughts thou hast, to ease our heavy heart.\n\n(Exeunt)\n\nACT II, Scene I\n\n(Enter three SERVANTS, in secret consultation)\n\nSERVANT 1:\nO, gracious King, we bring tidings dire and sweet,\nThat realm's great evil doth beget downfall's seat.\nA noble knight, thy nephew, hath been slain by foul deceit.\n\nKING:\nFie on this woe! Who's this knight? What wicked deed\nDidst he commit to see his cousin to the ground?\nSpeak quickly, good manservants. Let us know what move we must.\nAnd what of his name, that we may prepare a path\nFor him to rise again, and claim our royal right?\n\nSERVANT 2:\nTarry not, gracious King; his father's own hand\nHath sealed the wound. A villainous plot doth bring him low,\nTo win for himself the crown, which is ill-gotten won.\nAnd his most trusted advisor, a treacherous soul,\n\nKING:\nMethinks we know him well. His treachery shall be revealed,\nAnd when he comes before us, our justice shall unsealed.\n\nSERVANT 3:\nAye, gracious King, the trial's at hand, and thou shalt judge\nThis noble knight, whose honor doth now turn aside.\nPrepare thyself for woe and judgment's hour!\n\n(Enter the KING, with a heavy heart)\n\nKING:\nNow hasten thee, good servants, and bring back my nephew,\nThat we may weigh his merits in our royal trial's seat.\nBut soft, what noise doth come from yonder steeple high?",
