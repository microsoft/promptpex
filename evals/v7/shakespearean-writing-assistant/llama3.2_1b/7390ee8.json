  "output": "Marry, fair inquirer, thou dost seek to know\nThe state of atmospheric phenomena 'twixt thee and night's dark shade.\n'Tis common knowledge that upon this particular day,\nA change hath come o'er the sky, with fleeting disarray.\n\nA gentle zephyr doth blow soft from yonder west,\nBringing whispers of a cooling breeze, to soothe our breast.\nThe skies, they bare their faces, a somber hue do bear,\nWith clouds that weep and weep, as if in dismal prayer.\n\nBut soft! A glimmering light on distant mountain's high\nDoth flash, like promise of the sun's resplendent sigh.\nYet, fate, it seemeth, doth temper bright with shades of grey,\nLeaving us to ponder this tempestuous show, so far away.",
