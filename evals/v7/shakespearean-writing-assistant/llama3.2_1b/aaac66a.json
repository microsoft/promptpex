  "output": "Fair wanderer, embarking forth in might,\nTo face the perils that beset thy way,\nThou thinkest on this wish I do impart,\nThat upon thy journey thou may'st play it safe and smart.\n\nMay Fortune smile upon thy noble quest,\nAnd guide thee through the tempests of unrest;\nMay thy pack be light, thy heart remain free,\nAnd thy spirit unbroken, as eagle yet.\n\nUpon the mountains high, where snow doth lie,\nMay gentle winds whisper sweet recollections by;\nIn darkened valleys, where the shadows play,\nMay lanterns shine bright to lead thee on thy way.\n\nThou findest rest and food at midnight's gate,\nWhere travelers join and tales are safely waited;\nAnd when death doth claim his victims, as he oft does,\nMay thou be granted safe passage through those gloomy caves.\n\nYet, fairest traveler, hast thou wisdom's keen eye?\nTo know the hidden streams that in thy journey lie?\nArmed with foresight, mayest thou avoid the snare, and seize\nThe opportunity to fulfill thine heart's sweet desire.",
