  "output": "Fair sir or madam, gather 'round and heed my tale,\nOf one who once set sail on open seas to prevail.\nA journey fraught with peril, test of wills and might,\nTo navigate the waves, without a guiding light.\n\nAt dawn's break, he stood upon the deck so tall,\nThe stars faded fast, as morning's radiance did enthrall.\nThe winds they whispered secrets, as the gull's sweet song\nDid echo through the void, where nothing else belonged.\n\nHe cast his line into the blue, and waited patiently long,\nFor a finger's gentle tug, to prove his fortune strong.\nBut naught but stillness met his eyes, no sign of prey,\nOnly the vast ocean's darkness held its sway.\n\nHis provisions ran low, as sunbeams waned away,\nAnd night did creep upon him like a thief in disarray.\nHe sought shelter from the stormy eye of the moon,\nA temporary refuge, till the tempests' fury had flown.\n\nIn desperation he turned to the stars above,\nFor guidance to his fate, to help him navigate the tides.\nThe North Star shone bright, as steady hand did lead,\nThrough darkness's veil, where shadows fled before ye be dead.\n\nDays lost their passage, and though a glimmer remained,\nYet still he sailed on, in vain expectation yet unseamed.\nAnd when at last, his shipyard soothly did arise anew,\nHe stood upon its keel, with heart both firm and true.\n\nHis journey ended, thus: From mortal doubts to steadfast glee;\nThe stormy night spent, his trust in stars now freed.\nFare thee well, brave sailor! May these waves not hold thy sway,\nAnd though the sea may be unforgiving, never let it lead thee astray.",
