  "output": "When first thou spring's sweet gentle breeze didst blow,\nAnd warm'st my heart with tender shoots to grow,\nThe forest green and woods, in vibrant hue,\nDidst bloom beneath thy radiant beams anew.\n\nBut then, as summer's warmth didst start to seep,\nMy slumbering dreams were oftened by heat's keep,\nThe sun doth shone with fiery passion bright,\nAnd verdant scents do pierce my nostrils' plight.\n\nYet, as the autumn leaves began to lose their prime,\nAnd golden fingers of decay didst entwine,\nI felt a melancholy sadness creep,\nA time of letting go that my heart would keep.\n\nBut lo! The winter's icy kiss was sent,\nAnd frosty whispers woke my heart's intent;\nThe stars did sparkle like diamonds bright and white,\nAs snowflakes danced in silence, on this silent night.\n\nYet still we wait for spring to unfold its might,\nWhen life beneath the earth doth stir anew in sight.\nFor then shall summer's warmth awaken from her sleep,\nAnd forest green shall bloom once more, and softly creep.\n\nBut till that time, I'll hold the beauty of each season true.",
