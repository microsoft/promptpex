  "output": "O, fairest patron, with heart of gold,\nThou seekest a tale to be told.\nOf valor and honor true,\nIn the land of chivalry anew.\n\n'Tis I, a knight, with steed in view,\nTo embark upon a noble quest, anon.\nMy realm is threatened by a wicked might,\nBy forces fierce, and dark of night.\n\nI ride forthwith, with heart aflame,\nTo save my people, and their rightful claim.\nThe forests deep, with ancient lore,\nGuard secrets hidden, and enigmatic score.\n\nOur quest begins in twilight's hush,\nWhere shadows dance, and wild things rush.\nA mysterious path unfolds before mine eyes,\nThrough mystic symbols, whispered by the trees' wise sighs.\n\nThe wind whispereth secrets, as I rode,\nOf dragon's lair, where fire burns aloft, and gold is trodden.\nMy armor shines like moonlight bright,\nAs I approach, with knightly might.\n\nThe beast awakens, fiery coals aflame,\nAnd we engage in strife, with valorous game.\nBut lo! A sage owl, with silken wings,\nSaves thee from fire, with witching rings.\n\nThe beast lies vanquished, yea, the quest is won,\nYet I remain, at thy behest, to carry on.\nMy heart doth sing, my spirit free,\nFor justice done, and honor's decree.",
