  "output": "Fair villagers, rising with the dawn's pale glow,\nThe morning light, like liquid gold, doth slowly flow.\nUpon thy quaint thatched rooflines, gentle beams do play,\nAnd whispers of the night, now faded, fade away.\n\nWith softest touch, the dew-kissed grass doth start to gleam,\nAs sunrise' radiance, in misty veils, doth beam\nThe morning's promise: peace, hope, and harmony divine.\nAnd in this tranquil scene, all hearts, with joy, are thine.",
