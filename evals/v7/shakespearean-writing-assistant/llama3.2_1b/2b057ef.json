I shall conjure up a prediction most rare,\nAdhering not to the mundane concerns of thee and me in this fair air.\n\n**Thou wilt \"weather\" with clear skies and calm delight**\nOn days when sun shines bright, without a cloud in sight.\nThe winds that do softly whisper through the trees\nShall rustle leaves in gentle harmony, as nature's peaceful breeze.\n\nOr perchance thou mayest request a turn of fate,\nAs showers bring forth blessings to thy garden's state.\nA light drizzle or two shall mark the start of summer's heat,\nBringing new growth and verdure to all that's at thee.\n\nIn times when storms do rage, with thunder's mighty roar,\nThe earth shall tremble beneath, yet in calmness lie more.\nYet 'tis not a guarantee, for nature's whims are cold,\nAnd weather becometh capricious, like the moods of women bold.\n\nThus, listen thou to the wind and its gentle voice,\nFor in its whispers lies the answer to thy wishy-bye rejoice!",
