  "output": "A gentle stream doth flow beside,\nAnd on its tranquil surface, my thoughts reside.\nThe river's waters, like my soul's deep sleep,\nDo whisper secrets that my mind doth keep.\n\nWhat mysteries beneath this verdant shore\nShall I discover? Shall wisdom be in store?\nIs't merely a desire for sustenance and rest,\nOr is there more to life than mere mortal quest?\n\nThe ripples on the water's glassy face\nRefract the sun's bright beams, a kaleidoscope of blue and white.\nDoth not this symmetry of order prevail,\nA mirrored reflection of the universe's great tale?\n\nIn days of youth, I wandered 'neath this tree,\nHeard whispers of the world, wild and carefree.\nNow, as an echo-keeper of their refrain,\nI ponder on the journey through life's maze in vain.\n\nStill, I press onward, through the quiet's steady hush,\nWhere thoughts like willows sway, and wisdom in my cup\nDo gently stir, a soft awakening of the mind,\nTo secrets hidden 'neath the waters' mystic fold.",
