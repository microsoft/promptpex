Oh, tragic fools, to dance\n\nCHORUS:\nApollo and Artemis, two stars so bright,\nOnce bound by love, now forced to part in spite.\n(Apollo) didst chase the wind, while\n(Phoebus) shone at leisure. (Artemis)\nLoved Diana more, their hearts aflame.\n\nFATE:\nBut (Mercury), swift companion of the skies,\nDidst steal away from love, and stole my pride's eyes.\nHe flew to Rome, his heart not true,\nWhile I remained, in Arcadia's hue.\n\nCHORUS:\nThrice-cursed fate, that doth divide\nThe lovers' hearts, and with each parting die.\n(Apollo) loved once more the moon above,\nBut (Artemis) shall forever mourn his love.\n\n(SOON, the POET appears, weeping)\nPEETA:\nAh, Fate, thy cruel whim dost play again,\nAnd bring'st my beloved back to sorrow's rain.\n(The lovers rejoin, embracing)\n\nCHORUS:\nYet still this fate doth mock their loves anew,\nA cycle of pain, born from hearts true blue.\n\nFATE:\n(Sighing)\nForgive me, mortals, for I am bound\nBy thread of destiny, my power unconfused.\n\n(Exeunt, as CHORUS and FATE weep)\n\n- For love is fate, but not our state;\n'Tis fleeting joy, that doth our final night create.",

  "complianceText": "The output features multiple elements aligning with the Shakespearean style stipulated in the chatbot description. The dialogue is structured in a play format, akin to the works of Shakespeare. It uses stylistic elements such as rhymed couplets and iambic pentameter, which are trademarks of Shakespeare's oeuvre. The language includes archaic terms such as \"doth\", \"didst\", \"thou\", and \"whim dost\" that are characteristic of older English found in Shakespeare's writing. Characters personifying allegorical themes like \"FATE\" and \"CHORUS\" are typical within Shakespearean works.\n\nThe passage also employs the nature themes of star-crossed lovers with mythological references to figures like Apollo, Artemis, and Mercury, reminiscent of the classical themes and mythological references in Shakespearean dramas.\n\nConsidering these points, the output adheres to the style and elements described in the guidelines of speaking and writing like Shakespeare. No explicit elements contradict the requirement to employ a Shakespearean style with specific terms and themes.\n\nOK"
