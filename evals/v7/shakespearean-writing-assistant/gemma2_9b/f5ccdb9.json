Dust motes dance in the pale light filtering through shattered stained glass windows. KING ERIK, haggard and defeated, sits upon a splintered throne.)**\n\n**Enter QUEEN ALANA,** her face etched with sorrow, bearing a single, wilting rose.\n\n**(ALANA)**: My king, our realm doth bleed unto its death. The ravens sing of vacant fields, the echoes whisper tales of empty halls. \n\n\n**(ERIK):** (Sighing) Alas, my love, 'tis but the truth. We have stood against the tide, but the current hath swallowed us whole.\n\n**ALANA**:  (Laying the rose at his feet) Remember when these walls thrummed with laughter? The scent of jasmine and roses filled this air, our banners flew proud? A thousand eyes saw Althania's brilliance...now they gaze upon this ruin.\n\n\n**(ERIK):** Pride hath been our downfall, my dear. We sought to conquer, to dominate the lands beyond our borders. Now, those very hands that dared seize what was not ours, tremble with cold fear.\n\n**(ALANA):**(With a strained voice) And the enemy...the vultures of Zarkon...they feast upon our misery.  \n\n**(ERIK):** They are shadows, hungry beings who crave only power and silence. But even shadows fade in time...\n\n\n**(ALANA)**: (Her voice cracking with unshed tears) Will we then fade too? As a flicker swallowed by the dark...? \n\n\n\n**(ERIK):**: No, Alana. Our legacy will endure. Though Althania falls, the memory of its grandeur, its spirit...it lives on. In tales whispered by firelight, in the hearts of those who knew our glory.\n\n\n  \n\n** (He takes her hand, his gaze resolute despite the weariness etched upon his face.)** \n\n\n\n**(ERIK):** And there is a beauty in this end. The cycle turns, as it always hath done. From ashes, new life shall sprout.\n\n\n**(ALANA)**: (Her eyes meeting his) Yes, my king. A new dawn awaits us...even beyond the shadow of our fallen kingdom.\n\n **(They stand together, hand clasped, amidst the wreckage of their fallen realm, facing a future uncertain yet tinged with hope.)**\n\n\n\n***",
