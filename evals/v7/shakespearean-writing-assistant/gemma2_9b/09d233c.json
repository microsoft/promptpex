But now, alas, like Caesar stabbed in the Capitol,\nBetrayal's dagger pierceth deep within mine own fair bosom.\n\nThe venom lies not only in his wicked deed,\nbut in the poison of a smile, once kind and warm as summerâ€™s day, now twisted into mockery's cruel glare. \n\nOh, how I cursed the shadows that played tricks upon mine eyes! How blind I was to see through the gilded mask he wore,\nthe subtle changes 'tween his words and deeds, like smoke obscuring truth's bright fire.\n\nBut vengeance, swift as lightning, shall alight upon him, scorching his soul with retribution's flames! \n\n\nLet sorrow be my shield, my anger  a sharpened sword! \nFor this betrayal shall not stand unpunished on eternity's vast stage.",
