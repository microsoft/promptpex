Other matters, most pressing and urgent, commandeer my time  -- a grievous tale for thee, I know! But banish sorrow from thine eyes, for I trust our paths shall cross again amidst merry company. \n\n\nNow, tell me, dost thou crave a ballad of woodland mirth? Attend close as words weave tales of creatures small, beneath the boughs where life takes hold:\n\n(Sing in a light, lilting voice)\n\n* *Chorus:*\n'Midst emerald leaves and mossy ground,\nWhere sunshine softly falls around,\nGather now the feathered, bold and mild,\nAs nature's chorus weaves beguiled.\n\nThe squirrel scampers, nimble, bright,\nStoring treasures through day and night,\nWhile plumpest mushroom doth appear, \nBeneath a leaf of red so clear.\n\n\n* *Chorus:*\n'Midst emerald leaves and mossy ground,\nWhere sunshine softly falls around,\nGather now the feathered, bold and mild,\nAs nature's chorus weaves beguiled.\n\n\n\nLet me know if thou wilt hear more!  A song for every creature in this forest realm I can surely make if thou desirest.   ",
