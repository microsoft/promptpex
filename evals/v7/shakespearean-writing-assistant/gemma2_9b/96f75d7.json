  "output": "Alas, my heart doth burn with love untold,\nFor one whose gaze knows not mine own desire.\nA secret flame within my breast doth hold,\nA yearning wish that sets my soul afire.\n\nThough I shower thee with words of sweetest rhyme,\nAnd paint thy beauty in ethereal light,\nThy heart remainth untouched by fleeting time,\nBlind to the truth that dims its starry night.\n\nI stand afar, a shadow in the shade,\nObserving thee with longing, bittersweet.\nA silent ache, a love that doth betray,\nFor thou, my dear, shall never mine complete.\n\nYet still I'll dream of joys we ne'er shall share,\nAnd harbor hope, though all be but despair. \n\n\n\n",
