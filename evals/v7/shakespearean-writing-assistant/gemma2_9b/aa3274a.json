  "output": "Hark! 'Tis past the witching hour, and moon doth paint the garden silver bright.  Two souls, their hearts aflame with secret fire, do meet beneath the stars' embrace, concealed from prying eyes.  \n\nThe air is thick with jasmine scent, and whispers soft as lovers' sighs do fill the dew-kissed night. A clandestine glance, a touch that sets afire, forbidden fruit doth tempt their lips in stolen kisses. Moonlight glistens on a gown of silk, cascading like silver waterfalls, while eyes meet, reflecting love untold. \n\nBut dawn approaches, painting the eastern sky with streaks of rose and gold. 'Tis time to part, yet memories of this sweet embrace will linger long, a tapestry woven from moonlight, passion, and secrets whispered in the garden's heart.\n\n\n\n\n",
