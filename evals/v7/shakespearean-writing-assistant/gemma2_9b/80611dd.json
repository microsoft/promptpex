  "output": "Hark! A tale I spin of friendship most unlikely, \n'Tween mighty Giant, grim with eyes like thunderbolts, \nAnd nimble Dwarf, small as the sparrow in flight,\nWhose wit did shine brighter than any sunbeam gold.\n\nBig Barnaby, the Giant, stood tall 'neath stormy skies,\nHis footsteps shook the very earth, his voice a rumbling tide.\nBut within him lived a gentle heart, forlorn and lone,\nFor none dared speak with him save in trembling tones.\n\nThen came Tim Tiny, small and bold, with laughter light as air,\nUnfraid of Barnaby's size, he climbed upon his knee and there\nDid spin him tales of wondrous lands, with dragons fierce and bright,\nAnd Barnaby, enthralled by speech so merry and full of might.\n\nFrom then did bloom a friendship strange, yet dear to both their souls,\nThe Giant sharing wisdom deep, while Dwarf with stories trolls\nAnd jests would fill the lonely hours, 'til laughter echoed round,\nTwo friends so different, bound by love, on common ground.\n\n\n\n\n",
