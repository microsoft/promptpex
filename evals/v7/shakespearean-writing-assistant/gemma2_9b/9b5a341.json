The air is thick with merriment, as joyous music fills the space, while noblemen in velvet robes, do grace this regal place. A king sits proudly at his throne, a crown of jewels adorning thee.  His queen, a vision fair and pure, doth smile with beauty, free.\n\nRound tables groan with bounty rare, from roast boar grand to sugared mead.

A banquet fit for kings, it seems, yet danger lurks in shadows gray... \n\n\n\n",
