Victory! Our foes are slain,\nTheir banners fall, a crimson stain!\nLet trumpets sound and voices rise,\nFor glory earned beneath these skies!\n\nThe leader fell, his army broke,\nTheir spirits crushed, their fortune choked.\nWe stand triumphant, strong and bold,\nA tale of valor now to be told! \n\n(Chorus)\nVictory! Victory! Our foes are slain,\nTheir banners fall, a crimson stain!\nLet trumpets sound and voices rise,\nFor glory earned beneath these skies!\n\n\n",
