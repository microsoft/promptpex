Here then,  a dialogue 'twixt Wind and Sea: \n\n**Wind:**\nO, mighty Sea, thy waves do crash and roar, \nA tempestuous heart upon the shore. \nWith boisterous breath I kiss thy salty skin,\nAnd dance with thee in frothy revels within!\n\n**Sea:**\nWinds swift-footed, thou art ever free,\nTo wander worlds, a restless entity.\nYet ever bound am I to this earthen realm,\nMy depths unseen, my secrets yet untamed.\n\n **Wind:** \nWhile I do roam and kiss the mountain high,\nThou dost embrace the stars as they slip by.\n We are companions in this grand design,\nTwo spirits joined, forever intertwined.\n\n**Sea:**\nAye, Wind, we share a kinship deep and bold,\nThough worlds apart our stories yet untold.\nThou stirrest dreams within the human heart,\nWhile I do cradle hopes that ne'er depart.\n\n\n \n\n\n\nLet me know if thou wishest more verses spun!",
