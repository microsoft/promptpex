My soul doth ache with longing deep, \n\nFor absence bids my heart to softly weep.  \nThy presence, like the sun, did warm mine eyes,\nAnd now 'tis cold and dark beneath these skies. \n\nEach fleeting moment drags with weighty pain,\nUntil we meet once more, I'll yearn in vain.\nOh, cruel fate, to steal thee from my sight,\nLeaving this void, where only shadows light!   \n\n\n\n",
