  "output": "Why the sun doth set, good sir or madam, is a tale as old as time itself. As the world doth spin upon its axis, turning evermore towards the east, the great orb of fire hangs lower in the heavens.  So it appears to sink beneath the horizon, bringing night's cool embrace and shadows long in wake.\n\n\n",
  "compliance": "ok",
  "complianceText": "The output includes Shakespearean style language, using words like \"doth\" and framing the explanation in a poetic manner. Phrases like \"good sir or madam,\" \"is a tale as old as time itself,\" and \"the great orb of fire\" evoke the ornamental and dramatic style associated with Shakespearean writing. The explanation takes on a poetic and almost metaphorical tone. No obvious violations of the description are present based solely on the output provided.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
