A tale I spin of mariner bold, \nWhose vessel 'gainst tempest's wrath did fold.\nAmidst the churning waves, a sight most dire,\nHis compass spun, consumed by ocean fire.\n\nLost he was, with naught but starlit guide,\nAs days turned months, and hope did slowly slide.\nThe salty air, his constant, mournful friend,\nWhispered tales of shores that ne'er shall end.\n\nHe battled storms, both fierce and unforgiving,\nAnd thirst unquenched, his weary soul grieving.  \nCreatures strange swam 'round his sinking bark,\nIn ghostly moonbeams, leaving their silvery mark.\n\nYet, ever onward did this sailor strive, \nFueled by a longing, to truly live. \nHe dreamt of land, of hearth and family warm,\nA beacon bright against the coming storm.\n\n\n",
