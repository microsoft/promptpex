Let fear be cast aside like a beggarly cloak, replaced with the armor of courage! Our hearts burn with righteous fury, our blades thirst for justice!  Remember the fallen, their sacrifice fuel to our fire!\n\nFight with the heart of a lion, brothers!\nWith the cunning of the fox, we'll outsmart the enemy! For glory and freedom, let us strike! Remember, victory favors the bold, and today, WE SHALL BE BOLD! Advance! And remember, each foe vanquished brings us closer to peace! \n\n\n\n\n",

  "complianceText": "The output of the chatbot is written in a Shakespearean style as required. It uses archaic terms such as \"doth,\" \"hath,\" and phrases reminiscent of a Shakespearean tone, which aligns with the described style. It captures the essence of a motivational speech or a rallying cry fitting within Shakespearean themes of valor and battle, akin to speeches found in plays like \"Henry V.\" The language is dramatic and poetic, characteristic of the Elizabethan era. There are no elements in the text that deviate from the sought style, and so there appear to be no violations of the chatbot description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
