  "output": "Hark, gentle friend! A tapestry of dreams did weave its spell upon my slumber last eve.\n\nI found myself in a forest deep and vast, where ancient trees stood tall, their branches laced with silver moonbeams 'ponst a velvet sky. There, I spied a unicorn, its coat like snow freshly fallen, its horn ablaze with starlight. It gazed at me with eyes of purest sapphire, and then it spoke, though in whispers soft as summer breeze. \n\nA siren, voice like silver chimes, did lure me near a crystal lake. Her beauty, 'twas a sight to behold, yet danger lurked within her gaze. As I stood entranced, a griffin took flight overhead, its feathers painted gold and crimson, a fierce cry erupting from its beak as it soared above the whispering trees. \n\nSuddenly, a rumbling shook the earth, and from the shadows of the glade emerged a dragon of emerald scales, its nostrils spewing smoke that danced like spectral fireflies. Fear gripped my heart, yet as I gazed upon its majesty, I sensed a loneliness within its ancient eyes. Then, the dream faded, leaving me breathless with wonder as I awoke.\n\n\n\n",
