  "output": "Hark! The wheel of time doth turn anew, \nAnd Nature paints her canvas fresh and bold.\nThe summer's blush, a crimson hue so true,\nGiveth way to autumn's fires untold.\n\nLeaves doth ablaze in fiery gold embrace,\nTheir verdant crown replaced with shades of rust.\nA mournful wind whispers through time and space,\nAs Nature slumbers, wrapped in winter's crust.\n\nThen springtime bursts with life, a tender shoot,\nA symphony of birdsong fills the air.\nFlowers unfurl, their petals gently loot,\nAnd Earth awakes from slumber, free from care. \n\nSo turn we now to summer's sunlit grace,\nAnd marvel at Earth's beauty in its chase!\n\n\n\n Let me know if thou desirest another composition.",
