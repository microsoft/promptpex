A hush doth fall upon the throng,\nAs sunlight through the stained-glass windows flung,\nCreates a tapestry of vibrant light,\nUpon the dais, bathed in golden might.\n\nA gilded crown, with gems that sparkle bright,\nLies waiting there, a beacon in the sight.\nThe ancient lineage, their duty done,\nAnoint the heir, 'tis victory won!\n\nWith solemn words, and voices raised on high,\nThey swear allegiance to the new-made sky.\nUpon his brow, the crown a weight most fair,\nA symbol of dominion, power to share. \n\nThe trumpets blare, a joyous sound they make,\nAs crowds erupt in joyful, wild partake!\nA king is crowned, his reign now doth commence,\nMay fortune smile upon him, and his presence bless.\n\n\n\n",
