Cruel Fate hath spun her tapestry, weaving threads of sorrow and tearing at the fabric of our love.\n\nRosalind, my fairest flower, thy beauty outshines the sun, yet darkness clings to us like morning mist. By ancient decree, thou art promised to Lord Balthazar, a union forged in ambition's cold fire. While I, but a humble bard, can naught but offer thee verse and weary sighs.\n\n\"Oh,\" thine eyes do weep, \"if only Fate could hear our love's lament!\"  But alas, deaf are her ears to pleas, blind is her heart to tenderness. I see the chains of duty bind thee, and with a heavy heart, I whisper farewell. Go now, my Rosalind. May life grant thee happiness, though 'tis not in these arms that thou shalt find it.\n\n\n\n",
