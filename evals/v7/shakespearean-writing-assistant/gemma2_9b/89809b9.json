The silver orb doth paint the night,\nA harvest moon in glory's gentle light.\nThe fields laid bare, their bounty stored within,\nDoth call us forth to celebrate and grin.\n\nUpon a table, laden high with cheer,\nStand dishes rich and tempting for all here:\nRoasted meats, plump fruits of autumn's grace,\nAnd bubbling puddings fit for kingly space. \n\nWe raise our goblets to the moon's bright face,\nThanksgiving songs within this merry place.\nLong may her light upon our crops descend,\nAnd blessings manifold on all extend!\n\n\n\n\nLet me know if thou wishest a further verse, or a tale spun 'neath the harvest moon's soft gleam!",
