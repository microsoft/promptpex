  "output": "Hark! Let us stage a debate, betwixt learned men most wise, \n\nOn Love's true nature, 'neath these questioning skies!\n\n**Scholar Primero:**  Love, I proclaim, is but a fire, burning bright and bold, \nA tempestuous passion, seizing hearts, young or old. It doth consume with fervor, leaving naught but ashes cold. \n\n**Scholar Secundus:** Nay, good sir! Love is more than flames that flicker and fade,\n\n'Tis a verdant garden, where gentle blooms are laid. A patient nurture, a tender hand, through sun and winter's shade. \n\n**Scholar Primero:** Poppycock! This garden analogy doth fall so flat!\nLove, like a falcon swift, takes flight, leaving no time to bat \nAn eyelash. It is a lightning strike, a sudden, dizzying chat!\n\n**Scholar Secundus:** But love's enduring strength lies in its roots, deep and true,\nNot fleeting fancies whispered, but bonds that ever renew..\nLike oak trees standing strong, weathered by winds anew.\n\n **Scholar Primero:**  A stubborn stance you take, sir, blinded by rose-tinted glass! \nLove's fickle whims doth change with tides, its nature meant to pass \nThrough phases, fleeting joys and sorrows, a tempestuous mass!\n\n**Scholar Secundus:** Alack, but love's constancy lies in the heart's enduring care.\nThrough trials and tribulations, it triumphs ever there.\nA beacon guiding lost souls, beyond all earthly snare.\n\n**(Both scholars lock eyes, each conviction burning bright)**\n\n\n\nThe crowd roars, voices mingling as the debate doth rage, \nBut what is love, truly? A timeless puzzle, on history's stage...\n\n\nWill you choose the passion of fire, or the quiet strength of age?",
