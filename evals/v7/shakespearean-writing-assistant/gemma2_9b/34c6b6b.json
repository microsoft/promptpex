When shadows loomed and fear did grip the land,\nA simple peasant, with trowel in his hand,\nHeedless of peril, stepped forth from the crowd,\nHis voice, though humble, clear and strong, allowed.\n\nWith naught but courage as his armor bright,\nHe faced the monstrous foe, 'midst darkest night.\nNo knight he was, nor lord of noble name,\nBut in his heart, a hero's burning flame.\n\nWhile others fled and cowered at its might,\nHe stood unyielding, bathed in lantern light.\nHis words, like arrows, pierced the fiend's dark hold,\nAnd 'pon its back, a valiant tale was told.\n\n\n\nLet me know if thou wisheth to hear of further feats! \n",
