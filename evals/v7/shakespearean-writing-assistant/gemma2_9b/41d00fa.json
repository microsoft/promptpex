The morn hath kissed the slumbering hills, \nAnd painted dewdrops on each blade of green. \nA blush upon the heavens, softest chills, \nAs golden rays o'er tranquil fields convene.\n\nThe village slumbers, wrapped in morning mist, \nEach cottage door a humble mystery.  \nBirdsong doth rise, a sweet and gentle tryst,\nAnd whispers through the branches, light and free.\n\n\nLet me know if thou desirest further verses! \n",
