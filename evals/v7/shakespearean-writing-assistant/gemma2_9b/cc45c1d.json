The tempestuous nature of my own actions hath cast a shadow upon our once unshakeable bond, and for that, dear friend, I offer no excuses, but only my deepest regrets.\n\nKnow that words cannot express the sorrow I feel at the pain I hath wrought. Time alone can truly mend the breaches I have made, yet I pray thee to find it within thy generous heart to forgive this errant soul. \n\nWith every fibre of my being, I pledge to amend my ways and prove, through actions more than words, the steadfastness of my loyalty and affection.\n\n\nWith heartfelt remorse,\n\n[Noble's Name]  \n\n\n\n",
