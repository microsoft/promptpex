  "output": "My heart, a captive bird within its cage,\n\nDoth sing a song of longing and despair,\n\nFor thee, fair maiden, on whose radiant stage\n\nMine unseen passion plays with hopeless care.\n\nThy eyes, twin stars, that pierce the darkest night,\n\nShine bright upon another's worthily grace,\n\nWhile mine own soul in shadowed chambers dwelleth,\n\nYearning for warmth from thy celestial face.\n\nOh, cruel fate! to love and yet be loveless,\n\nA bitter draught I swallow with regret;\n\nBut though my hopes may wither, passion, truest,\n\nShall burn within, a fire I cannot fetter, yet. \n\n\n\n\nLet me know if you desire more verses upon this theme, good sir or madam.  \n",
