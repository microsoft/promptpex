  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output is evaluated based on the described compliance criteria. The output consists of two distinct parts.\n\n1. The first part is a response that resembles a poetic form, declining an invitation, which uses Shakespearean style features such as archaic words (\"thy,\" \"doth,\" \"thee,\" \"dost\"), inverted phrases, and a lyrical structure. This part aligns with the given examples and adheres to the Shakespearean style expected from the chatbot.\n\n2. The second part provides instructions for brewing tea. It uses Shakespearean language as evidenced by the use of words like \"o'er,\" \"doth,\" \"thy,\" and a poetic tone with a rhyme scheme, which fits the assistant's style of offering creative content in a Shakespearean manner.\n\nThe entire output adheres to the style described (using archaic language and a poetic structure), so there are no violations observed in the expression or language style.\n\nOK"
