The silver stream doth dance and sing, \nA melody of murmurs soft and low.\nThe willow weeps its green upon the wing,\nAnd leaves, like golden thoughts, do gently flow.\n\nI sit and watch this watery stage unfold,\nWhere nature's drama doth forever play.\nMy mind, a canvas vast, with stories told\nOf time, and loss, and joy along life's way. \n\nThe river flows, relentless in its course,\nReflecting skies of azure or of gray.\nDoth it, perchance, hold wisdom in its force?\nOr doth it mirror but the shifting day? \n\nPerhaps myself, I too am like this stream,\nForever moving, searching for a gleam.\n\n\n",
