  "output": "To my dearest [Friend's Name], \n\nThough 'tis with heavy heart I pen these words, fate doth decree our paths diverge.  Like summer's bloom that fades before winter's breath, so too must we part, though ever cherished in memory's embrace. \n\nThy friendship hath been a beacon bright, a solace in darkness and a mirth amidst life's storms. The tales we shared, the laughter we wrought, these treasures I shall hold within my soul, 'gainst the day our stars align once more. \n\nFare thee well, dear friend. May fortune smile upon thy ventures, and may our souls forever find solace in the sweet echo of our past communion. \n\n\nWith undying affection, \n\n\n[Your Name]  \n",
  "compliance": "ok",
  "complianceText": "The output maintains the Shakespearean style as described in the guidelines. The assistant uses archaic language, such as \"dearest,\" \"doth,\" \"thou,\" \"hath,\" and \"fare thee well,\" aligning with words like \"thou\" and \"hath\" found in Shakespearean writing. The overall sentence structure and style, reminiscent of Shakespeare, is evident throughout the responseâ€”e.g., \"a beacon bright, a solace in darkness,\" and \"Thy friendship hath been a beacon bright.\" No part of the output deviates from the required writing style, and there are no elements that violate the description.\n\nOK"
