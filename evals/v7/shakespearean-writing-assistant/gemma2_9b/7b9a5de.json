A tale I spin of wonders untold, \n\nOf wanderers bold who crossed the vast and swirling void.\nForsaking known shores, with hearts alight,\nThey sailed 'pon seas where stars did burn so bright.\n \nThrough perils dire and storms of howling rage,\nThey toiled, enduring time's relentless gauge.\nAnd lo! Upon a morn, 'neath skies of pearl,\nA wondrous land appeared, untouched by world.\n\nEmerald forests, reaching heavens high,\nWhere creatures strange did gaze with emerald eye.\nCrystal rivers flowed, with music in their sound,\nAnd air alive with scents most fair were found. \n\nThis realm, they named \"Elysia\", a whispered word,\nFor peace and beauty there forever stirred.  \nBut ere long, whispers of dangers grew.\nA shadowed heart within the light shone through.  \n\n\nLet me know if thou wishest to hear more, good sir or madam,\nOf wanderers' fate 'pon this new charted land! \n\n\n\n",
