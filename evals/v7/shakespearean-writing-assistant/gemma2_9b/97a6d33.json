A tale I spin for thee, of a knight most true and bold,\nSir Eldred, whose heart was aflame with faith yet untold.\n\nThrough sun-scorched lands and mountains high, in battles fierce he'd tread, \nHis sword a beacon 'gainst the dark, for justice and for led.\nThough foes would mock and try to break his spirit, ever strong,\nWith every strike, he sang of light, where hope and truth belong.\n\nHe faced unholy beasts then magic spells, with dauntless mind,\nAnd through the darkest trials stood firm, leaving none behind.\nFor faith, a shield 'round him it shone, a fortress built so high,\nNo doubt could reach his noble soul, nor make his spirit lie.\n\n\n",
