  "output": "Within the gilded halls of Royalty's embrace, 'twas said two bards did vie for praise and place. \n\nSir Lionel, with verses smooth and sweet, spun tales of love and triumphs bittersweet.  His words like honey, flowed upon the ear, earning him favour, banishing all fear.\n\nBut Lord Alastor, dark and full of fire, crafted verse of wrath, ambition's pyre. Sharp wit his weapon, biting satire's sting, he challenged Lionel, let the clashing ring!\n\nThe King himself, captivated by their art, would pit them 'gainst each other, play a cruel part.  A theme assigned, each poet must create, to win the crown and seal their lofty fate. \n\nYet both esteemed the contest, fueled by pride, ignoring whispers of deceit inside. For in this dance of words, on courtly ground, true victory was solace ever found. \n\n\n",
