A whisper through the crowd did fall, 'Twas uttered by a stranger, pale and tall. \n\"A serpent bright, with scales of midnight hue,\nShall rise upon the throne, and fate renew.\n\nHis words shall pierce like daggers to the heart,\nAnd tear asunder worlds, both near and far.   \nBeware ye all, for darkness doth descend,\nThe hour shall come when tyrants rule, my friend.\"\n\nThen vanished he, as swiftly as a dream,\nLeaving behind but shadows and a scream.  \n\n\n\nLet me know if thou wishest more of this tale to unfold!   \n",
