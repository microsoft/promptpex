A Hero's light hath fled the sphere, \nHis valiant deeds now silent 'midst our fears.\nA soul so bright, consumed by darkest night,\nLeaving behind a void of endless plight.\n\nOh, fallen champion, thy spirit doth soar,\nAmongst the stars, forevermore.\nThy courage bold, thy wisdom ever keen,\nA memory etched, a sight most serene. \n\nBut shadows gather, grief doth fill the air,\nAs we lament thee, beyond compare.\nThe world grow darker, for thy light is gone,\nYet in our hearts, thine embers brightly drawn.  \n\n\n\n",
