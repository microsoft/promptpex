A tapestry, once vibrant hues, now hangs in tatters, its faded threads spun with tales of tragic loss. \n\nIn yonder hall, a grand fireplace stands cold and hushed, where embers danced not long ago 'tween revelry and laughter light. Now, only whispers echo 'pon the marble floor, remnants of forgotten feasts and fading glory.  Each step doth creep upon thy soul, for unseen eyes observe thee from the shadows, and icy chills betray the presence of those long departedâ€¦\n\n\n",
