All ye nobles, and fair ladies fair, \nThe shadows lift, the darkness doth despair!\nOur valiant king, restored by hope's bright ray,\nHath vanquished woes and ushered in a day\n\nWhere peace doth reign, and laughter fills the air.\nThough trials grim did test our hearts with care,\nWe rise anew, with joyous songs we sing,\nThe kingdom blessed, its future now shall spring!\n\n\nFrom fertile fields, good harvests will arise,\nAnd friendship's bonds bind loyal hearts and eyes.\nSo let us celebrate, with trumpets bright,\nThis noble end, a triumph borne of light! \n\nGone is the strife, the bitter feud, the pain.\nA golden age begins, a sweet refrain.\nRemember well this tale, so hard fought, true,\nAnd may our kingdom ever prosper through!  \n\n\n\n",
