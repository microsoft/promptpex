  "output": "A youthful heart, like spring's first tender bloom,\nDoth burst forth green upon the earth's bare face.\nWith vibrant hues and joyous, dancing plume,\nIt greets the sun, and leaves a gentle trace.\n\nLike budding boughs that stretch towards heaven's light,\nYoung spirits soar with dreams both bold and deep.\nTheir laughter rings, a symphony so bright,\nThat echoes through the meadows where they leap.\n\nYet fickle Spring may fade to summer's heat,\nAnd youthful blooms, like roses, wilt with time.\nBut memories of beauty shall we greet, \nIn Autumn's grace, when seasons intertwine.\n\nSo let us cherish youth, its fleeting grace,\nBefore winter's chill doth leave not a trace.\n\n\n\n",
