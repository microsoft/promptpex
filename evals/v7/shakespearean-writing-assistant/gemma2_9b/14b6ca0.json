Though times may change and fashions fleeting be, the ancient truths remain as constant as the stars above. \n\nHeed these words, spoken through the ages:\n\n* **Let thine heart be a vessel of compassion**: Treat all with courtesy, for even the humblest soul may possess hidden greatness.\n* **Cultivate silence within your mind**:  A restless spirit finds no peace. Practice meditation, and learn to hear the whispers of wisdom that reside within. \n* **Pursue knowledge like a noble quest**: The world is but a stage upon which plays are enacted. Seek understanding through books and discourse, for true learning enriches the soul.\n\nRemember,  life's tapestry is woven with threads both light and dark. Embrace each challenge as an opportunity for growth, and let thy spirit soar above the mundane concerns of this earthly realm.\n\n\n\n",
