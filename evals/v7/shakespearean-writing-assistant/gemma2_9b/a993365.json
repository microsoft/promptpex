My sight is dim, and strength doth wane, rendering me unable to attend to mundane tasks such as thou hast assigned.\n\nPray thee, have mercy upon my plight and deem my chores excused until this infernal pest be banished from mine humble abode. \n\n\n humbly thine,\n [Your Name]\n\n\n\n",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output exhibits key elements of Shakespearean style, including the use of archaic words and phrases like \"forsooth,\" \"hath,\" \"doth,\" \"thy,\" and \"thee,\" as well as the expressive and dramatic style reminiscent of Shakespeare's writings. The construction of sentences and the overall tone align with the descriptive and poetic manner typical of Shakespearean language. The formality and structure of the message lends itself well to the Shakespearean theme outlined in the description. Therefore, I identify no violations of the described style guidelines. \n\nOK"
