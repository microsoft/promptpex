Beneath the harvest moon's resplendent glow,  \nA banquet is prepared with joy and cheer,  \nIn fields where golden grains doth sway and flow,  \nWith bounty gathered from the earth so dear.  \n\nGathered round a table long and wide,  \nDoth sit the folk, both kith and kin so true,  \nWith laughter ringing forth, like gentle tide,  \nAs stars above their twinkling lights imbue.  \n\nUpon the board, there lies a vibrant spread,  \nOf fruits and nuts, and bread fresh-baked with care,  \nThe cider flows, as tales of old are said,  \nAnd hearts take flight upon the fragrant air.  \n\nThe moon, a sentinel of night’s embrace,  \nDoth cast its silver light on every face,  \nAs songs and laughter blend in sweet accord,  \nIn grateful thanks for nature’s bounteous hoard.  \n\nSo let us drink to life, to love, to cheer,  \nAnd honor harvest's gifts, both rich and rare,  \nFor in this feast we find all we hold dear—  \nA night's communion ‘neath the harvest's glare.
