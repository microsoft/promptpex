  "output": "In yon enchanted glade where sunlight weaves,  \nAmidst the whispering leaves and gentle breeze,  \nI chanced upon a creature most sublimeâ€”  \nA fae, resplendent, in her prime.  \n\nWith silken wings that shimmered like the stars,  \nHer laughter danced upon the air, afar.  \n\"Good morrow, traveler,\" she did gently say,  \n\"What brings thee to this enchanted fray?\"  \n\n\"Fair spirit,\" quoth I, \"I wander lost,  \nIn search of solace, not caring for the cost.  \nThis forest's charm hath beckoned me so near,  \nYet here I find both beauty and great fear.\"  \n\nShe tilted her head, with a gaze so profound,  \n\"Fear not, dear soul, for in magic thou art found.  \nBut heed my warning, for shadows dost creep,  \nWhere dreams take flight, dark secrets doth keep.\"  \n\nWith an enchanting smile, she swirled about,  \nAnd with every twirl, the woods sang with shout.  \nA moment so fleeting, yet forever to stay,  \nIn my heart's quiet chamber, it shall solidly lay.  \n\nThus, I departed, with a heart now light,  \nGrateful for the fae, who brought forth the light.  \nIn woodlands deep, where whimsy doth dwell,  \nLies magic enshrined, and stories to tell.",
