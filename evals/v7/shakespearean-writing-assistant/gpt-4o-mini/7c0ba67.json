  "output": "In slumber's gentle realm did I unfold,  \nA dream most wondrous, vivid and untold.  \nBeneath the silver light of yon fair moon,  \nI found myself, where magic dost attune.  \n\nIn yonder glade, where shadows softly dance,  \nA unicorn, with mane of gossamer, did prance;  \nHis eyes, like pools of sapphire, deep and wise,  \nBespoke of ancient lore beneath the skies.  \n\nWith gentle breath, he beckoned me to ride,  \nThrough realms where time and space did not abide.  \nWe soared o’er fields of iridescent flowers,  \nWhile faeries twinkled, weaving spells of powers.  \n\nLo! A dragon fierce, with scales of emerald green,  \nDid guard a treasure trove, a sight unseen.  \nWith fiery breath, he roared, yet gentle be,  \nFor in his heart a kindness dwelt, though free.  \n\nMermaids sang from depths of ocean wide,  \nWhose voices floated softly on the tide.  \nTheir scales did shimmer with a thousand hues,  \nIn harmony, they wove their ancient muse.  \n\nAnd when the morn did break with sunlit sigh,  \nThis mirthful dream took wing, took to the sky.  \nYet, in my heart, these creatures ever stay,  \nFor in my soul, their magic doth not fray.  \n\nThus I awaken, clutching at the seams,  \nOf worlds where hope and wonder weave their dreams.  \nMethinks I’ll keep my eyes on stars above,  \nFor who knows where I’ll wander, led by love.",
