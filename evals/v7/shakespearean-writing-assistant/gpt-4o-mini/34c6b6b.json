Together we fight!  \nLet not this foul darkness extinguish our light.  \nFor who shall defend if we falter in fright?  \nIn unity strong, we can conquer this blight!\"  \n\nThus, amidst discontent and the echoes of dread,  \nThe peasant did rise, and the hearts of the dead  \nWere quickened with faith, as they followed his lead,  \nFor courage begets hope in the face of all greed.  \n\nAnd so, with his kin, he did vanquish the night,  \nA beacon of bravery, a spirit of light.  \nIn the annals of time, let his tale be enshrined,  \nFor a peasant may be small, yet in heart, he designâ€™d.
