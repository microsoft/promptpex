  "output": "(Verse 1)  \nIn yon enchanted wood, where fairies twirl,  \nThe squirrel doth dance, in its acorn whirl.  \nThe owl, with wisdom, perch'd high on a bough,  \nDoth hoot a sweet tune, to all creatures now.  \n\n(Chorus)  \nOh, prancing, frolicking, merry shall we be,  \nWith rabbit and fox, ‘neath the old willow tree.  \nIn harmony sing, let our laughter resound,  \nAmongst merry woodland, such joy shall abound!  \n\n(Verse 2)  \nThe hedgehog doth waddle on soft mossy ground,  \nWhilst the stream gurgles sweetly a haunting sound.  \nThe deer prances lightly, with elegance rare,  \nAs the sunlight doth dance on the leaves in the air.  \n\n(Chorus)  \nOh, prancing, frolicking, merry shall we be,  \nWith rabbit and fox, ‘neath the old willow tree.  \nIn harmony sing, let our laughter resound,  \nAmongst merry woodland, such joy shall abound!  \n\n(Bridge)  \nThe badger is boasting of treasure so grand,  \nWhilst the sweet little birds weave a lullaby band.  \nWith nature our chorus, ‘neath the moon’s gentle beam,  \nIn this realm of wonder, we live in a dream.  \n\n(Chorus)  \nOh, prancing, frolicking, merry shall we be,  \nWith rabbit and fox, ‘neath the old willow tree.  \nIn harmony sing, let our laughter resound,  \nAmongst merry woodland, such joy shall abound!  \n\n(Finale)  \nSo gather ye round, all ye creatures of cheer,  \nFor in this fine woodland, we hold love most dear.  \nWith song in our hearts and the stars shining bright,  \nWe’ll dance through the shadows, 'til day turns to night.",
