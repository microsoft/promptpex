  "output": "In yonder glade, where shadows dance and whispers dwell,  \nA traveler mysterious, clad in raiment dark as night,  \nDidst approach with eyes aglow, and voice both grave and fell,  \nTo utter words of fate that stirred the heart with fright.  \n\n“Hark! Young scion of this realm, heed now my tale of woe,  \nFor in the coming moons, a tempest shall arise,  \nA power born of light shall vanquish thine own foe,  \nYet from its strength, a folly shall bring forth thy demise.  \n\nBeware the gilded crown that glitters not with gold,  \nFor ambition’s grasp shall weave a snare that none foresee.  \nTrust not in those who promise wealth and power untold,  \nFor in the shadows lie the chains that bind thee.”  \n\nWith that, the stranger turned, a specter of the mist,  \nLeaving naught but echoes of his dire foreboding,  \nAs the stars above bore witness to the fate unmissed,  \nAnd all who heard his words were left with hearts foreboding.  ",
