  "output": "O dearest heart, within the shadows of mine affection doth dwell a whisper, a sweet echo of longing that surpasseth mere words. As the sun doth rise each morn, casting its gentle light upon the world, so too doth my heart stir for thee, though in silence it remains cloaked. \n\nThou art the hidden rose in a garden of thorns, whose fragrance doth beckon from afar, igniting a fire within thy humble admirer. In dreams I wander through the realms of thy beauty, yet in the waking world doth fear hold sway o’er my tongue.\n\nThere lies a current, strong as the tide, that draws me close, yet I weave my thoughts in subtle threads, fearing the tempest that honesty may stir. But know this, sweetest soul—if the stars align and fate be kind, I would brave the tempest for but a glimpse of thine essence. \n\nIn the hush of twilight, I confide to the stars, though the world may remain oblivious—my admiration for thee is a sonnet unspoken, rich with all the hues of passion's delicate blush. In shadows deep, my heart hath chosen thee, though the dawn may never know its name.",
