An unforeseen circumstance hath conspired against me, as the carriage I did summon was delayed most grievously by the foul weather and rugged roads.\n\nI assure thee that it is with remorse I pen this missive, for I value my duties most dearly and seek to fulfill them with utmost diligence. I have taken measures to prevent such a mishap from occurring again henceforth.\n\nI appreciate thy understanding in this matter and vow to redouble mine efforts to meet the expectations thou dost hold for me.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Your Name]",
