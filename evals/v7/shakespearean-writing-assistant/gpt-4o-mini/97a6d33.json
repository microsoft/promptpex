  "output": "In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,  \nThere dwelt a knight, Sir Alaric, strong and keen.  \nWith armor bright and spirit true as steel,  \nHe roamed the lands, with faith his guiding wheel.  \n\nNow, he did pledge his heart to the divine,  \nIn battles fierce, he called upon the sign,  \nWith every foe that crossed his noble path,  \nHe spoke aloud, invoking heaven's wrath.  \n\nUpon a day, when darkness did descend,  \nA dragon fierce, with scales as dark as sin,  \nDid wreak havoc 'cross the meadows fair and bright,  \nAnd stole away the maiden, pure and light.  \n\nThe townsfolk trembled, filled with dread and woe,  \nYet Alaric stood, his face aglow:  \n\"Fear not, good people, for I shall not waver,  \nMy faith in God shall guide my sword and favor.\"  \n\nWith lance in hand, he rode 'neath blood-red sky,  \nHis heart a fortress, he knew not to cry.  \n\"O sainted spirits, grant me strength this hour,  \nTo face this beast, and prove my noble power.\"  \n\nWith courage drawn from faith’s own sacred well,  \nHe came upon the dragon's lair, a hell!  \nIt roared like thunder, teeth like blades of ice,  \nYet Alaric pressed forth, heedless of the price.  \n\n\"Beast of the night! Thy reign doth come to end,  \nWith faith as my shield and heaven as my friend!\"  \nHe charged the beast, with shout both fierce and bold,  \nAnd struck with fury, brave, undaunted, and uncontrolled.  \n\nThe dragon’s cry did echo through the air,  \nYet Alaric stood firm, his heart laid bare.  \nWith every blow, he called upon the light,  \nHis faith did bring forth strength to win the fight.  \n\nAt last, the dragon fell, with one last roar,  \nAnd thus the knight did save his love once more.  \nThe maiden, freed, with laughter like a chime,  \nDid bless the knight, who stood through fear and crime.  \n\n\"Thou art my savior, true as faithful sun,  \nWith love and courage, this great battle's won!\"  \nAnd so, in tales both vast and legend bright,  \nSir Alaric lives, a knight of purest light.  \n\nFor faith, unwavering through the darkest night,  \nShall ever guide the heart, and set it right.  \nThus, let this tale of valor resound clear,  \nThat love and faith shall conquer every fear.",
