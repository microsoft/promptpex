  "output": "In yon tranquil hamlet where slumber doth fade,  \nThe morning light doth gently cascade.  \nAs Aurora ascends with her golden hue,  \nSoftly she kisses the earth anew.  \n\nFrom yonder hills, the sun doth arise,  \nIts beams like diamonds, doth glisten in skies.  \nShadows retreat with the night’s tender breath,  \nWhilst whispers of dawn celebrate life’s bequeath.  \n\nThrough clusters of trees, dappled light does play,  \nWaking the flowers to greet the new day.  \nThe brook bubbles forth with a melodious tune,  \nAs nature rejoices beneath the fair moon.  \n\nThus, in the stillness, the village awakes,  \nWith hearts full of hope that each morn new life makes.  \nA tableau of beauty, so gentle and bright,  \nAs morning light dances, dispelling the night.",
