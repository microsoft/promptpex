Enter JULIET and ROMEO, cloaked in shadows, as the night wraps around the two fated hearts.)**\n\n**JULIET:**  \nO, Romeo! Thou knowest not the weight  \nOf this cruel world, which seeks to tear us hence.  \nMy heart doth ache, ‘tis fate that dost conspire  \nTo keep our souls in torment, far apart.\n\n**ROMEO:**  \nFair Juliet, dost thou speak of cruel fate?  \nWhat fortune frowns upon our tender love?  \nCan the stars above, with their eternal light,  \nNot weave for us a destiny more kind?\n\n**JULIET:**  \nAlas, my sweetest love, we stand on quaking ground,  \nFor thou art bound by honor’s heavy chains,  \nAnd I, a daughter sworn to family’s name,  \nIn shadows dark, our love is doomed to pain.\n\n**ROMEO:**  \nThen let me be thy knight, forsake all ties,  \nFor in this moment, nothing else matters.  \nI’d steal thee from the hands of destiny,  \nAnd drown our sorrows in the sea of bliss.\n\n**JULIET:**  \nNay, gentle heart, for what would I become—  \nA wretched thief, who robs her kin of peace?  \nIf fate decrees that we, in dreams, must meet,  \nThen so be it! I shall endure this grief.\n\n**(A sudden gust of wind stirs the trees, echoing the tempest in their hearts.)**\n\n**ROMEO:**  \nO bitter winds, that blow between our souls,  \nWith thine icy breath dost thou sever our bond!  \nBut hear me now, I’ll fight against this fate,  \nFor love’s sweet power, I shall never scorn.\n\n**JULIET:**  \nYet, Romeo, the hour beckons me away.  \nThou must return, ere dawn doth break our night.  \nIf fate should part us, know this truth I swear—  \nMy love shall endure beyond the realms of light.\n\n**(They embrace, a moment suspended in time, but the distant chime of bells reminds them of the harsh reality.)**\n\n**ROMEO:**  \nThen take this token, a vow sealed in my heart,  \nThat I shall cherish thee till stars forget to shine.  \nThough fate may part our bodies, souls entwined  \nShall whisper sweet as evening’s gentle breeze.\n\n**JULIET:**  \nFarewell, my love, let tears fall not in vain—  \nFor in the echoes of our hearts, we’re one.  \nThough cruel fate hath wrought this bitter pain,  \nI'll carry thee upon the wings of dreams 'til day is done.\n\n**(With hearts heavy and spirits entwined, they part, shadows fading as destiny claims its prize.)**",
