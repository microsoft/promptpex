  "output": "**Title: The Tragedy of Eldoria**\n\n*Setting: A once-magnificent throne room, now draped in shadows. The tapestries, once vibrant, hang tattered and faded. The atmosphere is thick with despair as courtiers gather, their faces pale and drawn. King Theodric stands at the head of the room, sword in hand, his expression a mix of fury and sorrow.*\n\n---\n\n**[King Theodric]**  \nO wretched fate, that which hath robbed me  \nOf joy and peace! Thy treacherous whispers  \nDoth echo through the hollow halls of Eldoria.  \nWherefore hath the light of our great kingdom  \nFallen into this abyss of ruin? \n\n**[Lady Isolde]**  \nMy liege, the tides of fate dost not favor us.  \nThe traitor’s hand hath risen against thy crown.  \nThe banners of rebellion wave upon yon hills,  \nAnd the hearts of the people dost tremble with fear.\n\n**[Lord Cedric]**  \nO King, dost not despair! Yet still there be  \nLoyal souls who rally to thy noble cause.  \nThe gallant knights of yore, armed with resolve,  \nPrepare to do battle ‘gainst the usurper’s might.\n\n**[King Theodric]**  \nNay, Cedric! What hope remains when trust is lost?  \nThe very soil hath betrayed our sacred ground.  \nOur allies be gone, like shadows in the mist,  \nAnd our enemies draw closer like vultures to prey.\n\n**[Enter Cassandra, a seer of ill omens]**  \nHark! What dost thou, my liege, implore?  \nThe wheel of fortune spins with cruel intent.  \nI bring tidings cloaked in darkness and dread:  \nThe prophecy foretells of blood and betrayal.\n\n**[King Theodric]**  \nThou speakest of shadows, yet give me light!  \nWhat dost thou foresee? Speak plain, unvarnished truth,  \nSo that I may steel my heart ‘gainst the blows to come.\n\n**[Cassandra]**  \nThe stars align to weave a tapestry ghastly;  \nA throne soaked in sorrow, a kingdom laid waste.  \nBeware the friends who kneel, for in their hearts  \nLie daggers poised to pierce thy royal breast.  \nTrust not their smiles, for they be laced with poison.  \nThe kingdom’s end is nigh, ere the dusk of thy reign.\n\n**[Lady Isolde, distraught]**  \nO heavens! What cruel jest dost fate employ?  \nCan a kingdom wrought of valor and pride  \nSurrender to whispers, to treacherous hearts?  \nSpeak not of doom, for hope yet lingers!\n\n**[King Theodric, in despair]**  \nWould that I could banish this foul specter!  \nYet as I gaze upon my loyal kin,  \nI find naught but shadows of what once was.  \nThe threads of fate unravel ‘neath my grasp,  \nAnd the tapestry of Eldoria frayeth.\n\n**[Lord Cedric]**  \nRise, my King! Speak not of surrender!  \nGather thine arms and prepare for the storm.  \nFor even in darkness, a flicker may spark—  \nA flame may ignite the hearts of the brave!\n\n**[King Theodric, with newfound resolve]**  \nThen let us face the tempest with hearts ablaze!  \nIf we must fall, let us not do so in vain;  \nBut raise our swords ‘gainst despair’s cruel hand,  \nAnd though the end may loom, we shall stand as one! \n\n*The courtiers, emboldened by the King’s words, exchange glances of determination, poised to face the impending storm that threatens to consume their beloved kingdom.*\n\n*Exeunt omnes, the sound of clanging swords fills the air as they depart to meet their fate.*\n\n---\n\n*Thus ends the lament of a kingdom, caught in the throes of treachery and despair, yet still yearning for bravado as the clouds of doom gather o’er Eldoria.*",
