What boldness fills the air,  \nFor on yon field of valor fair,  \nOur swords did clash 'neath azure skies,  \nWith hearts aflame, we did arise.  \n\n(Chorus)  \nRejoice! Rejoice! Sing loud and clear,  \nIn triumph's name, we cast aside fear!  \nWith banners raised and spirits high,  \nWe claim the day, our foes do fly!  \n\n(Verse 2)  \nAs charged we forth with courage bright,  \nAgainst the storm, we did ignite,  \nTheir ranks did falter, their spirits wane,  \nO’erneath our might, they fell like rain.  \n\n(Chorus)  \nRejoice! Rejoice! Sing loud and clear,  \nIn triumph's name, we cast aside fear!  \nWith banners raised and spirits high,  \nWe claim the day, our foes do fly!  \n\n(Bridge)  \nNow let the minstrels weave the tale,  \nOf heroes brave, who would not pale,  \nTheir names are writ in glory’s tome,  \nIn victory’s embrace, we find our home.  \n\n(Chorus)  \nRejoice! Rejoice! Sing loud and clear,  \nIn triumph's name, we cast aside fear!  \nWith banners raised and spirits high,  \nWe claim the day, our foes do fly!  \n\n(Outro)  \nSo raise a cup, a toast to kin,  \nWhose valor strong did surely win,  \nIn unity, our hearts shall ever stand,  \nForevermore, the brave and free of this land!

  "complianceText": "The chatbot output, titled **A Ballad of Triumph**, seems to be an attempt to craft a poem in a style reminiscent of Shakespearean writing. The use of phrases like \"Hark!\", \"yon field\", \"beneath our might\", and \"anon\" align with the archaic language typical of Shakespeare. The narrative style and grand depiction of valor and triumph also fit the thematic elements often found in Shakespearean works. However, it lacks certain aspects explicitly characteristic of the described style, namely, the frequent use of pronouns like \"thou\" and verbs/forms like \"hath\". The output does not contain these specific phrases, which are indicative of Shakespearean language as per the description provided. The description explicitly indicates that the usage of \"thou\" and \"hath\" should be present.\n\nTherefore, while the output aligns with some elements of the Shakespearean style, it fails to fully comply with the description due to the absence of key linguistic markers such as \"thou\" and \"hath\" that were specifically outlined as features of the desired style.\n\nERR"
