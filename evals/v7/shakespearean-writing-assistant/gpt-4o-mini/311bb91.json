She soliloquizes as her handmaid, ELSA, observes.]**\n\n**LUCIA:**  \nO! What doth the stars whisper in yonder night?  \nMethinks ambition's whisper doth call to mine heart.  \nLike a tempest 'tis rousing the dormant flame,  \nWhich, once kindled, shall illuminate the darkened path.  \nThou knowest, Elsa, how the crown doth glimmer so bright,  \nYet fetters wrought of duty do cradle my desire.  \n\n**ELSA:**  \nDear mistress, dost thou contemplate the throne?  \nThe weight of such glory, twouldst bring thee to weep;  \nFor many a noble hath fallen in pursuit,  \nAnd envy’s dagger lies waiting in the shadows.\n\n**LUCIA:**  \nNay! I heed not the dark murmurings of fate.  \nIn every heart, ambition begets great deeds;  \n‘Tis the fever of greatness that courses through my veins.  \nWhy should I not grasp the scepter, the golden crown?  \nShould not a woman aspire to carve her name in the annals?  \n\n**ELSA:**  \nBut trust not the rose without thorns, sweet Lucia.  \nThe path of power be lined with treachery's kiss,  \nAnd allies oft become wolves when thine back is turned.  \n\n**LUCIA:**  \nWhat matter the perils, if I rise to claim my due?  \nFor all the thorns may prick, I shall not be dismayed.  \nI shall forge my own destiny, wield my wits and guile;  \nThe world be but a stage, and I shall not play the fool!  \n\n**[She strides towards the window, gazing into the moonlit night.]**\n\n**LUCIA (cont’d):**  \nI hear ambition’s siren song call my name;  \nWith heart ablaze, I shall remake my tale!  \nThe throne awaits, my spirit doth resolutely dare.  \nLet fate be warned, I shall not linger in shadow;  \nFor ‘tis I, and I alone, that authors my ascent!  \n\n**[ELSA looks upon her mistress with worry, but LUCIA stands determined.]**  \n\n**ELSA:**  \nThen, let the fates conspire, and may fortune smile,  \nYet, heed my counsel, tread carefully with thy guile.  \n\n**[Exit LUCIA as she strides forth, with ambition burning bright in her eyes.]**\n\n**[Scene ends.]**",
