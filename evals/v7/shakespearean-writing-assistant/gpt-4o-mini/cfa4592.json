  "output": "O fair sailor, heed my words, for I shall craft a charm most fine,  \nTo keep thee safe ‘neath heaven's grace, where waves and tempests intertwine.  \nLet it be a simple token, wrought of silver, bright and true,  \nA pendant shaped as a compass rose, to guide and guard thy voyage through.  \n\nInscribed upon its gleaming face, a verse of solace, light, and cheer,  \n“Stay thy heart, brave mariner bold, for the stars shall ever be near.”  \nA strand of braided sailor’s thread, in blue of sea and white of foam,  \nLet it dangle from thy neck with pride, a symbol of thy seafaring home.  \n\nAs storms do rise and winds do howl, clasp this charm with steady hand,  \nFor fortune favours those who trust, and anchors hope ‘neath ocean’s grand.  \nSo sail, good friend, with heart afire, let this blessing steer thy way,  \nFor love and courage shall not tire, and guide thee back to light of day.",
