  "output": "Upon a mournful night, my heart dost sigh,  \nFor loveâ€™s sweet bloom doth wither in the shade;  \nThou art the sun, yet I but shadow lie,  \nA flame that flickers but cannot invade.  \n\nThy laughter rings like music from the skies,  \nYet each sweet note dost pierce mine aching soul;  \nIn dreams I dwell, where naught but hope can rise,  \nBut waking brings me naught but bitter toll.  \n\nI pen thy name in every whispered prayer,  \nYet thou, fair one, dost not the ink receive;  \nAs roses bloom, so doth my heart declare,  \nIn silence, I must bear what I believe.  \n\nThough love be blind and fate doth cruelly steer,  \nMy heart remains, forever bound, yet near.

  "complianceText": "The chatbot output provided is in line with Shakespearean style, as requested by the description. It employs typical elements of Shakespeare's language, including the use of words like \"dost,\" \"art,\" \"thou,\" \"thee,\" and \"doth,\" which are reminiscent of the Elizabethan English style. The text is arranged in a poetic form, reflective of Shakespeare's known style with rich imagery and emotive language.\n\nThere seems to be no violation of the requirements that can be assessed without the input. Specifically, the style is clearly Shakespearean, evident from the vocabulary and form used in the creation of this poetic piece. The precise compliance with the use of words such as \"thou\" and \"hath\" is in line with the requirement to use a Shakespearean style. Additionally, the melancholic theme and the expressive presentation, focusing on love and fate, align well with typical Shakespearean themes.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
