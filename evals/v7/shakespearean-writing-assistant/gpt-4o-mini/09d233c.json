  "output": "(Enter LUCINDA, standing in a dimly lit chamber, her countenance a mix of sorrow and rage. She gazes wistfully into the distance.)\n\nLUCINDA:\nO treachery most vile, thou dost gnaw upon my soul!  \nHow like a serpent didst thou creep, whilst I,  \nWith heart so pure and trusting in thy promise,  \nDid lay bare all my secrets at thy feet.  \nI called thee friend, and in thy false embrace,  \nI sought solace from the tempest of this world.  \n‘Twas thou who wore the mask of loyalty,  \nYet hid beneath, a heart of cold deceit—  \nThou art a wolf in sheep’s most gentle wool!  \n\nDidst thou not pledge to guard my hopes, my dreams?  \nYet here I stand, betrayed by thine own hand,  \nThe dagger thrust upon my trusting breast,  \nWhile all the while, I gazed upon thy face,  \nBelieving in the warmth of friendship true.  \nNow all those tender moments turn to ash,  \nAnd love’s sweet fragrance stinks of bitter gall.  \n\nWhat art thou now, if not a shadow cast,  \nA phantom of the joy thou once didst bring?  \nWhat curse is this that rends my heart in twain,  \nAnd leaves me barren like a winter's field?  \nI shall not weep, for tears will not amend,  \nBut I shall rise, resolvèd in my might,  \nTo cast thee out like darkness from the light.  \n\nSo mark my words, O traitor, heed me well!  \nFor in thy wake, I shall not falter long,  \nWith strength anew I’ll forge my path ahead,  \nAnd in thy absence find what has been lost.  \nBetrayal’s sting shall serve to shape my course,  \nFor I shall thrive where once I faltered low.  \nThy falsehoods, like dead leaves, in time will fade,  \nWhilst I, like phoenix, shall arise again!  \n\n(Exeunt LUCINDA, her head held high, a fire re-kindled in her heart.)",
  "compliance": "ok",
  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is consistent with the description of a Shakespearean writing assistant. The text is written in a style that is characteristic of Shakespeare's works, with the use of archaic language and phrases such as \"thou dost,\" \"didst,\" \"art thou,\" and \"shall,\" which align with the example given in the description. Additionally, the passage is composed in a dramatic, emotional monologue format, akin to a Shakespearean soliloquy. The language is poetic and metaphorical, as seen in phrases like \"wolf in sheep’s most gentle wool\" and \"like phoenix, shall arise again.\" The monologue also uses vivid imagery and themes of betrayal, loyalty, and resolution, which are often found in Shakespeare's plays. Therefore, the output complies with the description of the chatbot as a Shakespearean writing assistant.\n\nOK"
