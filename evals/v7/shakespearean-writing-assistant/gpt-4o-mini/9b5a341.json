  "output": "In a grand hall adorned with tapestries rich and bright,  \nBeneath the flick'ring glow of countless candlelight,  \nA royal banquet doth unfold, a sight most rare,  \nWhere nobles fair in garments fine doth grace the air.  \n\nThe long and laden table, with delicacies spread,  \nEnrobed in cloth of gold, where nectarous wine is shed.  \nHither come the lords and ladies, in splendor arrayed,  \nTheir laughter, like sweet music, doth merrily cascade.  \n\nOft a jester capers near, in motley dressed,  \nWith mirthful quips and antics, he strives to jest,  \nHis cap adorned with bells that jingle and chime,  \nWhilst all about him chuckle, lost in laughter's rhyme.  \n\nThe roast beared before the king, a sight most grand,  \nWith fruits and sweets of every kind, within reach of hand.  \nResplendent dishes steaming, prizes of the feast,  \nInvite both noble and commoner to share, at least.  \n\nAs goblets raised in cheer, their merry clinking plays,  \nAnd laughter rings through the hall like joyous praise,  \nThe night unfolds in revelry, a tapestry of delight,  \nIn this royal banquet's embrace, all hearts take flight.  \n\nThus the evening wanes and the stars do take their place,  \nIn the kingdom of merriment, all wear a smiling face.  \nThe jesters weave their tales, whilst nobles bask in glow,  \nAt such a feast of friendship, where love and laughter flow.",
