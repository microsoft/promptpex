  "output": "O fair spirits of the heavens, I dost implore thee,  \nReveal unto us what manner of weather shall be.  \nIf the sun be cloaked in a shroud of gray,  \nAnd gentle raindrops upon the earth do stray,  \nThen surely, the day shall wear a veil of sorrow,  \nYet hope springs eternal for a brighter morrow.  \n\nIf winds dost howl with a tempestuous roar,  \nAnd clouds dost gather, lo! a thunderous score,  \nThus anoint the fields with their nourishing tears,  \nTo bring forth the blooms of the coming years.  \n\nBut hark! Shouldst the sun shine bright and clear,  \nWith golden rays that fill all hearts with cheer,  \nThen the world dost revel in nature's sweet grace,  \nAs the morn dost awaken in a warm embrace.  \n\nIn all thy musings of weather's fickle hand,  \nTake heed that thou art but a guest on this land.",
