  "output": "In valor's name, with sword in hand,  \nA warrior bold did take his stand.  \nWith armor gleaming 'neath the sun,  \nHe faced the foe, ere day was done.  \n\nOn fields of green 'neath skies of gray,  \nWhere shadows cast in dire dismay,  \nDid rise the clash of steel and might,  \nAs stars did blink in fear of night.  \n\n“Come forth, ye knaves!” he cried with glee,  \n“For freedom’s cause, I shall not flee!  \nWith every swing, and every blow,  \nI'll smite thy hearts, ere thou dost go!”  \n\nThe drums of war, they beat so loud,  \nWhilst overhead, the heavens bowed.  \nThe earth did tremble 'neath their feet,  \nAs warriors met, in fierce repeat.  \n\nWith foes as numerous as the sand,  \nYet firm did stand this noble man.  \nHis heart afire, his spirit strong,  \nIn battle's thrall, he did belong.  \n\nWith every strike, his legend grew,  \nA tale of courage, pure and true.  \nAs arrows flew and swords did clash,  \nHe danced 'midst death in fervent flash.  \n\nAt length, the tide of war was turned,  \nWith valiant heart, his flame still burned.  \nAnd when the sun began to set,  \nThe foe lay vanquished, filled with regret.  \n\nO warrior, thou art forever hailed,  \nThy name in songs and legends nailed.  \nFor bravery in flesh and blood,  \nHath made thy fame through fire and flood.  \n\nSo raise a chalice to the skies,  \nTo honor those who fear not dies.  \nFor in this world of toil and strife,  \nIt is the valiant who claim their life.",
