His parchment's now a startled bee.  \n\nOh woe betide! He trips o’er a loose shoe,  \nAnd ink doth fly like raindrops, 'tis true!  \n“Pray pardon me!” he cries with a splutter,  \nAs words transform from prose to a jumbled mutter.  \n\nSo if thou seek'st a tale both wise and deft,  \nBeware of this scribe, for naught shall be left!  \nYet blesséd be the laugh that follows his plight,  \nFor in clumsiness doth hide a heart full of light!",
