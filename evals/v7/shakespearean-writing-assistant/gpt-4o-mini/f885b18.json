  "output": "To brew a cup of tea, first, take fresh water and pour it within a kettle's embrace. Place the kettle upon the flame, allowing the heat to rise until the water doth bubble and steam. \n\nWhilst the water dost heat, take a vessel—thy chosen cup—and place within it a tea bag or loose leaves, as thou preferest. \n\nOnce the water hath reached its boiling point, pour it carefully o'er thy tea, permitting it to steep for several minutes—be mindful of thy chosen strength. \n\nWhen the time hath come, remove the tea bag or strain the leaves. If thou desirest, add a spoon of sugar or a splash of milk to temper the brew. \n\nFinally, take a sip and revel in the warmth it bestoweth upon thy soul. Thus, a simple cup of tea is made.",
