My lute sings of yore,  \nOf love’s tender tales and the battles of lore.  \nIn forests and meadows, I've roamed far and wide,  \nWhilst the echoes of songs in my heart doth abide.  \n\n**Shepherd:** Thy music is sweet, like the babbling brook’s flow,  \nYet tell me, good sir, wherefore dost thou go?  \nWhat prompts thy restless feet to wander this way?  \nDost thou seek fortune, or the Muse’s bright sway?  \n\n**Minstrel:** In search of kindred souls, I doth travel and roam,  \nFor in the hearts of men lies the true spirit’s home.  \nEach village I visit, I gather their tales,  \nOf joy and of sorrow, of love that prevails.  \n\n**Shepherd:** A noble endeavor, to weave hearts with thy song,  \nIn the fields where I toil, I oft dream to belong.  \nPray, sit with me now as the sun starts to set,  \nAnd share thy sweet melodies, let us not fret.  \n\n**Minstrel:** Aye, dear shepherd, I shall gladly abide,  \nFor in thy humble company, my soul doth confide.  \nLet us trade tales of life, as the stars start to gleam,  \nIn the hush of the night, let us dance in a dream.  \n\n**Shepherd:** Then take this staff, and before the dusk falls,  \nTogether we’ll sing, ‘neath the moonlight’s soft thralls.  \nWith each note that we play, let the world fade away,  \nFor in friendship and music, we shall forever stay.
