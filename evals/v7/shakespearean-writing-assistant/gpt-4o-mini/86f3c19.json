  "output": "In fair Verona, where we set our scene,  \nThere dwelt a servant, humble and unseen,  \nBy name of Thomas, loyal and most wise,  \nBeside the lord, who sought with cunning guise.  \n\nThis lord, Sir Reginald, of lofty air,  \nDid boast of riches and a proud affair.  \nHe held a feast, and called his friends so grand,  \nYet sought to cheat the servant at his hand.  \n\n“Thou art but lowly, Thomas, servant meek,  \nWhat sayest thou to wager? Hast thou streak?  \nFor thine own purse is empty, whilst mine’s gold,  \nA golden cup, shall mine own hand behold.”  \n\n“Good sir,” quoth Thomas, with a gentle smile,  \n“Pray grant me leave to play, ‘tis worth the while.”  \nThe lord, with laughter loud, did nod his head,  \nYet knew not what was in the servant’s thread.  \n\nThe game began with stones both black and white,  \nThe lord, in pride, believed he played outright.  \nYet Thomas, deft of hand and quick of wit,  \nDid turn the tide with each computer’d bit.  \n\nWith teas’d confoundment, Reginald did fall,  \nAs Thomas wove a tapestry from all,  \nAt dusk, with triumph shining in his eyes,  \nHe saw the cunning lord in deep surprise.  \n\n“A cup of gold, now claim it, if thou can,  \nFor wisdom oft doth triumph over man.”  \nThe lord, bewildered, yielded forth the prize,  \nAnd learned in time, a heart hath worth much more than lies.  \n\nThus, Thomas, humble servant bright and keen,  \nDid teach the lord that greed is but a screen.  \nAnd so they parted, wiser, each in kind,  \nFor oft it is the meek that teach the blind.",
