  "output": "Upon the verdant bank where waters flow,  \nA thinker sits, enrapt in depth of thought.  \nThe gentle murmurs of the stream bestow  \nOn him a rhythm, soothing and distraught.  \n\n\"What is the essence of our fleeting plight?  \nWhy doth the river wind so smooth and free,  \nWhilst man, in toil, doth wrestle with his night,  \nAnd seeks to know what not yet he can see?  \n\nLo! The waters shimmer 'neath the sun’s warm gaze,  \nReflecting life, its joy and its despair.  \nYet doth each ripple hold the passing days,  \nA testament to time, both rich and rare.  \n\nHere, nature speaks in whispers soft and clear,  \n'Tis but a moment’s breath, this life we spend.  \nIn yon deep flow, I sense both hope and fear,  \nFor all must yield to time, that silent friend.\"  \n\nThus mused the sage, as currents danced and swirled,  \nIn contemplation of this fleeting world.
