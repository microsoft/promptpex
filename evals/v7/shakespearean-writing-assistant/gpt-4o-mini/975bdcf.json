  "output": "Upon the stage of Nature’s grand discourse,  \nWhere time dost weave its tapestry of fate,  \nThe seasons twirl, like dancers, with a force,  \nFrom spring’s sweet bloom to winter’s silent gate.  \n\nBehold! In spring, the daffodils do sing,  \nWith petals bright that greet the warming sun;  \nThe songbirds chirp, and joy begins to spring,  \nAs life returns, and all the world is one.  \n\nThen summer steals upon the joyous scene,  \nWith golden rays that paint the fields in light;  \nThe laughter of the children, pure and keen,  \nAs days stretch long ‘neath skies of azure bright.  \n\nYet autumn's brush dost tint the leaves with fire,  \nA palette rich, where crimson meets the gold;  \nThe harvest moons, they gather and conspire,  \nTo whisper tales of bounty yet untold.  \n\nAt last, the winter cometh with its chill,  \nA solemn shroud of white doth blanket all;  \nThe world, now silent, feels the frozen thrill,  \nAs dreams of springtime linger, soft yet small.  \n\nThus seasons pass, a cycle ever turning,  \nWith lessons deep in every shade and hue;  \nIn nature's heart, a grateful fire burning,  \nFor in each change, a beauty we construe.
