The nobility doth conspire, and shadows loom over the crown.\n\n**Queen:** Pray, speak clearer, good counsel! What treachery dost thou perceive amidst these gilded halls?\n\n**Advisor:** The Duke of Lancaster hath summoned allies to his side, seeking perchance to usurp thy rightful throne.\n\n**Queen:** Afoot indeed, it seems, are foul machinations. Yet, what wouldst thou suggest to thwart this vile ambition?\n\n**Advisor:** A show of strength, my liege! Gather thine loyalists and display thy might; let neither doubt nor fear reign in their hearts.\n\n**Queen:** Then by my crown, so shall it be! I shall rally my faithful subjects and gather our forces. Let them know that I, their queen, shan't yield to usurpation.\n\n**Advisor:** Wise is thy resolve, fair majesty. Together, we shall thwart these conspirators, for the crown doth rest upon a head most worthy.\n\n**Queen:** Come, let us devise a plan most cunning. We shall not only preserve our throne, but also strengthen the bonds of our kingdom!",
