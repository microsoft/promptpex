  "output": "**A Ballad of Sir Cedric's Quest**\n\nIn days of yore when valor shone,  \nA knight named Cedric brave was known.  \nWith heart of steel and spirit high,  \nHe sought a quest 'neath azure sky.  \n\nFrom castle grand to forest deep,  \nHe rode where shadows dared to creep.  \nWith sword in hand, and armor bright,  \nHe vowed to prove his worth in fight.  \n\nA dragon fierce, with scales of green,  \nDid roam the land, a terror seen.  \n'Twas said that should its wrath descend,  \nNot even the bravest soul could wend.  \n\n“Oh noble Cedric, heed the call,  \nFor thou alone can save us all!”  \nThe village cried, with hope and fear,  \nFor in their hearts, the knight was dear.  \n\nWith steed of black and helm adorned,  \nHe galloped forth, his heart was warmed.  \nThrough thicket thick and mountain cold,  \nThe tales of courage soon were told.  \n\nAt last he came to the dragon’s lair,  \nA cavern dark, a foulness there.  \nWith breath of fire and fierce red eyes,  \nThe beast did loom ‘neath shadowed skies.  \n\n“Come forth, thou beast, and meet thy fate,  \nFor justice, I shall not abate!”  \nSo spake brave Cedric, voice like thunder,  \nAnd charged with speed, like bolts of wonder.  \n\nThey clashed in battle, roar and clang,  \nAs steel met scale, the echoes sang.  \nThe dragon breathed, its flames did roar,  \nYet Cedric stood, unyielding, sure.  \n\nWith one swift strike, his sword did bite,  \nAnd blood did spill in firelight.  \nThe creature fell with a mighty groan,  \nThe knight stood tall, the victory won.  \n\nReturning home, the throngs did cheer,  \nFor Cedric’s name rang loud and clear.  \nA hero true, with heart so bold,  \nThus ends the tale of knightly gold.  \n\nSo raise a glass to courage bright,  \nTo Sir Cedric, the gallant knight.  \nFor in his heart forever stays,  \nThe flame of valor that brightly rays.",

  "complianceText": "The evaluation of the chatbot's output involves checking if the poem aligns with the Shakespearean style as described. The poem \"A Ballad of Sir Cedric's Quest\" predominantly utilizes archaic language and elements of classic English poetic structure, which is in line with the provided description. It contains a narrative consistent with the epic tales of valor and adventure typically found in such a style.\n\nThe poem uses words like \"thou\" and phrases that suggest an older form of English (\"In days of yore,\" \"With breath of fire and fierce red eyes,\" \"For thou alone can save us all!\" and \"For in his heart forever stays\"), which aligns with the requirement for Shakespearean language. The construction of the poem including linguistic choices and thematic elements showing noble quests, bravery, and victory, resonates with stories and sonnets of Shakespeare's era.
