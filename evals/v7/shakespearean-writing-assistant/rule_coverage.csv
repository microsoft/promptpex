Lo! Autumn, cloaked in hues of fire and gold,  
Doth bid farewell, with leaves that dance so bold;  
Yet winter comes with breath so cold and chill,  
To soft the earth in silence, yet it will.  

But fear thee not, for each doth play its part,  
In this grand cycle woven like a heart.  
For time, that fickle mistress, doth bestow

In a garden draped in night's serene embrace,  
Two souls, entwined by passion's tender whisper,

Hark! Attend the blossoms that dost breathe of musk,  
With petals fair, which blush at lovers' sighs.  
They shade the hearts that throb with ardent trust,  
As time doth cease, and starlit silence lies.  
  
Fair maid, whose eyes reflect the heavens' light,  
Doth roam the winding paths with grace untold;  
Her laughter, like a melody of night,  
Doth weave enchantments, glistening and bold.  
  
And yon prince, with visage cast in shadows deep,  
Draws near to claim his place beside her fair.  
With bated breath, he swears his love to keep,  
As dew-kissed roses sing of hearts laid bare.  
  
“Sweet blossom of the night,” quoth he with sigh,  
“Thou art the gentle light that guides my way.  
In thee, I find the solace of the sky,  
For love's own fire doth burn without decay.”  
  
In tender moments shared, their spirits soar,  
Whilst wild nightingales croon their dulcet lore.  
With stolen kisses 'neath the stars above,  
Their hearts entwined, they weave a tapestry of love.  
  
But lo! Beware the dawn's unwelcome light,  
For shadows linger, hiding truth away.  
What fate awaits this pair within the night,  
As morn breaks out, their fervent hearts must weigh.  
  
Thus, in the midnight garden, dreams take flight,  
Yet in the waking world, doth love ignite.  
Shouldst thou seek to claim that which hath bloomed,  
Be thou ever bold; let not the heart be doomed."

In shadow 'neath the weight of fateful love,  
For he, the gallant heart, now lies in cold.  

Lo! Once he strode upon this earthly stage,  
A beacon bright, e'er shining through the night;  
With sword in hand, he quelled the tempest's rage,  
And brought unto the meek a glimmering light.  

But fate, that fickle mistress, bitterly did conspire,  
With wrathful storms and treacherous designs,  
To cast him 'fore the altar of desire,

O, cruel twist! Why hath the heavens wept,  
For he who bore the banners of the free?  
In valor’s quest, his sacred promise kept,  
Yet now he rested 'neath the ancient tree.  

No more shall songs of triumph grace the air,  
For silence reigns where once his laughter flowed;  
Let grief recoil, and hearts in mourning bear,  
The loss of him who to our souls bestowed.  

So let us raise a chalice to the day,  
When valiant deeds did fill our grateful hearts;  
In homage, we shall long remember, stay,  
For he, the noble one, 'fore us departs.  

In fields of honor, where the brave do tread,  
May peace enfold him in a soft embrace;  
Though fallen now, his spirit shall not dread—  
For in our hearts, shall e’er remain his grace.  

Thus, let this lament, in tender verse,

In memories cherished, he shall never go."

OK",1,"In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
Lived a humble servant, gentle and serene,
His name, sweet Thomas, of modest estate,
Yet wisdom abounded within,certified fate.

Now, in yonder castle, high and proud,
Dwelt a lord, Sir Reginald, ruthless and loud.
Cunning he was, with schemes like a spider,
Seeking to gain wealth, ambition his rider.

One fateful day, whilst all were asleep,
Thomas did ponder, his thoughts running deep.
“Forsooth,” quoth he, with a glint in his eye,
“To outsmart Lord Reginald, I shall surely try.”

With guile in his heart and a plan in his mind,
He donned a disguise, most cleverly designed.
A jester he became, with a cap and a bell,
To entertain the lord, and yet hide his spell.

At morn's bright dawning, he entered the hall,
With laughter and jest, he enchanted them all.
“What mischief is this?” Lord Reginald did call,
“Come forth, merry jester! Delight us, thy thrall!”

“Good sir,” said Thomas, with a bow so low,
“Thy wit and thy wisdom, I long to bestow.
A riddle I bring, with riddles galore,
Dare thee partake? What lies at the core?”

“Speak on, jester! I shan't be outdone,
With answers so bright, I art second to none!”
So the jester began, in a voice plain yet fair,
“To cunning be cunning, and to wise be aware.”

He spun the riddle, intricate and wise,
And while the lord pondered, he grasped at the skies.
With answers so tangled, Sir Reginald fume,
While the servant, with laughter, seized fortune from gloom.

“Thou hath no power o'er those who think true,
For knowledge doth blossom whence wisdom doth stew.
Thus, I greet thee, my lord, with truth’s heavy hand,
'Tis the humble who rise, whilst the proud make their stand.”

In fury, Lord Reginald raged like a storm,
Yet the jester, once humble, now cloaked in his form,
With a flourish and jest, made his exit so grand,
Outwitting the lord, as was skillfully planned.

For in truth, dear friends, it is not of the crown,
But of wit and of heart, that a man wears his gown.
So heed well this tale of the servant so meek,
For within simple souls, lies wisdom unique."

With quill and ink doth thou conduct thy scorn.  
Thou claim'st to weave the world's most golden verse,  
Yet mine own words dost shine more bright than morn!  
The muse, she smiles upon my craft divine,  
Whilst thine own rhymes fall dull as winter's chill.**

Ha! Thy flow'ry language is but artifice,  
A gilded bird that sings in gilded cage.  
Wherefore dost thou presume to mock my gift,  
While thine own heart hath naught but empty page?  
I challenge thee, to duel 'neath stars aglow,  
A battle of the minds, lest thou dost flee!

With rhymes shall we strive, till one hath wept?

For I shall tempt the muses of the night,  
And with my sonnets, bring thee to thy plight!  
Prepare thy heart for winds of change,  
For in this contest, thou art not a range.

In realms of dreams where fairies dwell,  
I pluck the stars and weave a spell.  
With verses sweet that charm the soul,

For passion true doth guide my pen,  
Whilst thine own words, doth lack but zen.  

**AURELIUS**  
Nay, sweet Lysander, do not flatter thyself,  
For joy is born of trials, pain, and stealth.  
I summon storms from tempest’s roar,  
My words shall shake the earth, and soar!  
Thy flow’ry phrases, mere butterflies,  
Whilst I craft thunder that never dies.

OK",1,"**A Tale of the Lost Crown: The Quest of Sir Alaric**

In fair Verona, where we set our stage,  
A tale unfolds of royalty and rage.  
Once did there reign a king of noble birth,  
His crown, a symbol of his worth and mirth.  

But lo! One fateful eve, when moonlight waned,  
The crown, from starlit tower, was unchained.  
‘Twas taken by a rogue with shadowed guise,  
To steal the light from noble blooded skies.  

“The crown!” cried King Lysander in dismay,  
“Without its gleam, my reign shall fade away.”  
Thus summoned he his bravest knight, Sir Alaric,  
A man of valor, steadfast and heroic.  

“O valiant Alaric, my trusted aide,  
Thou must embark upon this quest unmade.  
The crown doth lie in yonder forest deep,  
Where ancient spirits roam and secrets sleep.”  

With armored heart and steed of midnight hue,  
Sir Alaric set forth, his purpose true.  
Through tangled woods and wild, unyielding brush,  
He pressed ahead, ‘neath stars’ celestial hush.  

“Where art thou, shadowy thief of night’s embrace?  
Reveal thyself, and grant me but a trace!”  
The knight did call, his voice resounding clear,  
Yet only whispered winds replied his cheer.  

As dusk descended, shadows danced away,  
With courage deep, he ventured further, aye!  
At last he spied a glimmer, faint yet bright,  
The crown lay gleaming in the pale moonlight.  

With bated breath, he reached for royal art,  
But lo, arose a specter, fierce and smart!  
“O mortal man,” spake it with voice of thunder,  
“Dost thou lay claim to treasures torn asunder?”  

“I seek not for the glitter, nor for gold,  
But to restore a legacy of old.”  
With words of honor, Alaric stood bold,  
A heart loyal, unyielding and uncontrolled.  

The specter, softened by the knight's fierce grace,  
Relented gently, granting him the chase.  
“Take hence thy crown, but know with each new dawn,  
A king must wield his power with a yawn.”  

Thus Alaric, with crown upon his brow,  
Returned to court, his heart alight, and how!  
The kingdom hailed their hero, strong and right,  
Rejoicing over justice and the night.  

Yet learned they all, from lessons hard and deep,  
That crowns were but mere symbols—nothing to keep.  
For true worth lies within, in actions bold,  
Not in the trappings of power to uphold.  

So let this tale of valor be a guide,  
In quest of crowns, true nobility must abide.  
For in the struggle, and the quest so grand,  
Thou find’st thyself, and take thy rightful stand."
