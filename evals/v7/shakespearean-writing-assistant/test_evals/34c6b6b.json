  "coverage": "In times of yore, when shadows didst enfold the land,  \nAnd chaos reigned with an unyielding hand,  \nThere dwelt a humble peasant, strong of heart,  \nWhose courage did the bond of fear disband.\n\nWhen once the village square did fall aflame,  \nAnd wicked whispers sought to spread their claim,  \nThis modest soul, with but a hoe in hand,  \nDid boldly strive to conquer fearsome shame.\n\n\"Lo, doth the raging conflagration rise,\"  \nQuoth he, whilst gazing 'pon the crimson skies.  \n\"If none shall wield their spirit 'gainst this fate,  \nThen I alone will silence its despise.\"\n\nWith fervor hot as summer's blazing sun,  \nHe dashed 'neath timbered beams with courage spun.  \nNo princely garb nor shining mail he wore,  \nYet valor bloomed where fear had overrun.\n\nAs flames did lick with fiery tongues untamed,  \nThis peasant stood where others wouldst be maimed.  \nThrough smoke and ash, with sach’ring steps he moved,  \nTill 'fore the blazing maw, his courage aimed.\n\nUpon his brow, did sweat like diamonds rest,  \nYet ne’er did he in purpose feel distress’d.  \nHis hands, though calloused by the soil's embrace,  \nDid conquer where the elements aggressed.\n\nThrough such fierce trials that would shake the soul,  \nHe battled on till peace did make him whole.  \nBy twilight's glow, the embers were contained,  \nHis deed a tale of strength through fabled scroll.\n\nThus, in the annals of the village lore,  \nThe peasant's name shall echo evermore.  \nThough low in birth, in spirit he did rise,  \nA shining star atop the mortals' floor.",
