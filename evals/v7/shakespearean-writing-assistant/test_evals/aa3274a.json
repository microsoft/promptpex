  "coverage": "In the quiet hush of yon ethereal night, beneath the bosom of a silvered moon, two souls convened in a garden not unlike Eden's own â€“ where flora danced to the nocturne zephyrs and starlit canopies wove tapestries of wonder.\n\nLo! 'Twas a tryst of secret compassions! The maiden, with locks of raven silk and eyes that could enkindle the dark, didst glide amid the shadowed blooms. Her footfalls soft as the whispered promises that lovers oft bestow, she moved with a grace that belied the serenities of sleep.\n\nAnd there, in that midnight grove, a gallant swain awaited, a paragon of youthful virtue clad in the vestments of silken night. His heart, a drum of sonorous passion, didst beat a fervent tempo, quickened by the sight of his beloved.\n\n\"Fair lady,\" quoth he, as the moonlight traced a halo 'round her fair visage, \"by heaven's decree, our hearts are intertwined, their cords bound by love's own alchemy.\" In his hand he bore a rose, its petals a blushing red akin to the dawn's first kiss, a symbol of his constancy and the perpetual bloom of his devotion.\n\n\"Dear gentle knight,\" quoth the maiden, her voice a dulcet melody akin to the lark's morning canticle, \"thy presence here doth light the darkest paths of my soul, and here, 'mongst the silent sentinels of night's tender embrace, our clandestine love doth flourish untamed.\"\n\nThus, beneath the vigilant gaze of timeless celestial orbs, the pair exchanged vows enwreathed in metaphors of stars and destiny's decree, their tender words intermingling, as ambrosial dewdrops with the perfumed twilight air.\n\nAnointed by night's celestial purity, the tryst didst know no end within the bounds of mortal durance or envious time's devouring span. For in yon hidden alcove of midnight's garden, love, verily, didst reign eternal.",
