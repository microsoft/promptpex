  "coverage": "In fair Verona, where our tale doth commence, there lived two noble youths of gentle grace, each bearing likeness to the other’s face, as if by nature’s jest or fate’s design.\n\nFirst there was Lysander, the charming heir of Montague’s esteemed and ancient line. His visage mirrored the countenance of Dorian, a gentle soul, the son of old Capulet, sworn foe to Montague by grudge long past.\n\nIt fell upon the eventide of Midsummer’s fest, where masks were worn and hearts were light, that Dorian, curious and bold, donned a guise as that of a Montague. Eager was he to spy on young Rosaline, whose fair presence ensnared his humble heart.\n\nYet mark how fate’s tapestry doth weave its artful deceit; for Lysander, pledged to another fair maid, didst that same night barter his own guise for a Capulet’s blended shade.\n\nAmidst the revelry and moonlit dance, both youths did wander, oblivious to their traded masks. Lysander, cloaked in Capulet’s semblance, chanced upon fair Juliet by the whispering brook. Enraptured by her radiant spirit, he wooed her thus with words most eloquent.\n\n“O fairest soul, what light from yonder visage breaks that pierces my soul with Cupid’s dart? Canst thou not feel the gentle weave of fate that doth bind our hearts in twilight’s embrace?”\n\nJuliet, mistaking him for Dorian, replied with blush’d cheek and trembling heart: “Art thou not the son of quarrelsome Capulet, who bears my heart in secret bower kept? For thee, I’d renounce all family name and plight allegiance to thy gentle love.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dorian, caparisoned as Lysander, didst find Rosaline amidst the fragrant grove. His earnest verse poured forth like summer rain: “Dear lady of my heart’s true expanse, doth not thy beauty gild the evening’s peace? Grant me thy love, and thus bequeath mine own.”\n\nRosaline, bethinking him to be Lysander, answered softly: “Thy sweet entreaties do find welcome in mine ears, brave Montague, though our houses be steeped in enmity’s ancient blood. My heart, unbidden, seeks thee thus, my love.”\n\nYet as the clock struck the midnight chime, reality’s harsh light shone upon the guise. Revealed were the youths’ true identities, and confusion reigned. The revelation brought forth a mirthful truce, as laughter echoed amidst once-foes. The mistaken dance of fates forged a bond anew, and henceforth, the Montagues and Capulets found peace.\n\nThus ends this tale of identities mistaken, where love and laughter offered joyful recompense to feuding hearts.",
