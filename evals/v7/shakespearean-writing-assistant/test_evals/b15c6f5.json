  "coverage": "Upon a gentle river’s verdant edge,\nWhere whispers of the waters soft delight\nIntrude upon the thoughts of learned sage,\nAs doth the amber glow of waning light.\n\n’Tis here, upon this rippling stream’s embrace,\nA ponderous soul doth weave his earnest thought,\nHis gaze cast ’pon the water’s tranquil face,\nReflecting truths by Nature subtly taught.\n\n\"Oh, noble river, thou dost ever flow,\nYet still remain in tranquil constancy,\nWhat secrets to the heart dost thou bestow\nTo guide a wandering mind towards clarity?”\n\nThus museth he, our sage, with furrowed brow,\nAs reeds do sway and whisper in the breeze,\n\"Thou art a mirror, river, ‘pon which now\nDoth shimmer Time, unfettered and at ease.\n\n\"Thy waters, like the wild and fleeting mind,\nDo wander ‘twixt yon crag and meadow wide,\nYet here, beneath the arch of Heaven kind,\nThou dost thy ceaseless course with grace abide.\"\n\nSo leave him there, amidst the murm’ring reeds,\nWhere Nature whispers truths both old and new,\nFor in his heart, the flowing truth he reads,\nWrit by the gentle river’s timeless hue.",
