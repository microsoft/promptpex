  "coverage": "Behold! As I peer into the heavens' vast expanse, I doth conjure visions of weathered fate, untethered from the bindings of modern spherèd knowledge. \n\nLo! A tempest brews within the eastern skies, like unto Neptune's wrathful tears descending 'neath the moon’s pale gaze. Yet, methinks the gentle Zephyr mayst soon alight with breath as soft as silken veils upon a yeoman's brow. The sun, that fiery orb, by morn shall rise in all its gilded dignity, bathing the earth in aureate splendor. \n\nPerchance the clouds like royal galleons shall drift on high, their shadows casting fleeting dreams upon the fields below. The noondays' heat, a fervent lord, shall reign but briefly 'ere the night usurps with cool embrace, where all creatures great and small take rest in Nature's quiet domain.\n\nThus, sweet sojourner, trustest to the winds of yonder fate, and let thy heart be steered by nature's ancient compass, for in such realms, no mortal compass may direct.",

Moreover, the input focuses on predicting the weather, which deviates from the requirement for creative content grounded in Shakespearan themes or styles.\n\nERR",
