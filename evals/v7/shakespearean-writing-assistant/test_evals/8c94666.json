  "coverage": "Alas, lament! The noble soul, now fled,  \nDoth lie enshrouded in a shroud of night,  \nThat once with courage stout the fields did tread,  \nAnd shone with valor as the morning light.  \nHe, whose bold heart ne'er waned nor waver’d weak,  \nThrough roaring tempest and through calmest day,  \nNow on Heaven’s tranquil shore doth seek  \nThe gentle rest from mortal coil’s fray.\n\nO, weep, ye heavens, with tears of sorrow's grace,  \nFor he, our champion brave, hath met his doom.  \nWith sword unsheathed, he braved the fated chase,  \nYet now doth rest within the earth's cold womb.  \nHis name, once sung in tones of praise and cheer,  \nShall echo 'cross the ages, bold and clear.  \n\nThus raise thine eyes to yon celestial sphere,  \nAnd know that though the shadows draw him near,  \nHis spirit, bright, transcends the bounds of earth,  \nEnkindling hearts with memories of worth.  \nSo let us tell his tale with grateful breath,  \nAnd honor him through life, and even death.",
