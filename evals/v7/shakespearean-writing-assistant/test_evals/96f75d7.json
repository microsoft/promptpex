  "coverage": "In fair and tender shadows of the night,  \nWhere restless hearts, in silence, doth repose,  \nThere beats a heart ensnared in love's own plight,  \nWhere longing's flame most fervently bestows.  \n\nAye, unrequited passion doth confound,  \nFor in its thrall, the soul is borne astray;  \nYet ne'er doth solitude such solace found,  \nAs love that seeks in vain the light of day.  \n\nForsooth, my heart, thou art a hapless guest,  \nEntwined in dreams that ne'er shall see the morn,  \nThy gentle whispers ne'er shall be confessed,  \nIn absence of affection, left forlorn.  \n\nYet in this pang of unrequited grace,  \nThese tears, like morning dew, do kiss thy face.  ",
