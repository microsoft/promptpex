  "coverage": "In the name of Neptune, sovereign of the deep,\nI conjure forth a charm, this sailor's keep.\nYe spirits of the brine, attend my call,\nAnd guard this vessel 'gainst the tempest's thrall.\n\nOh, gentle tides that kiss the sandy shore,\nLend mercy to this mariner ye implore.\nYe winds that wail upon the ocean's breast,\nLet not thine fury tear him from his rest.\n\nBy Poseidon's trident, seas obey,\nAnd in this charm, my solemn pledge I lay:\nLet not the Kraken rise nor sirens sing,\nNor whirlpool dire the sailor's doom to bring.\n\nBy moonlit beams that on the waters dance,\nKeep safe this ship, from fortune's random chance.\nReturn thee safe to port from farthest quest,\nAnd 'pon thy brow, the gentle zephyrs rest.\n\nThus, with this spell, thou art safeguard by night,\n'Gainst perils vast and dark, a guiding light.\nThis charm, hence doth I softly bestow,\nAs oaths 'neath stars with fervent heart doth glow.",
