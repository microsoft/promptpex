  "coverage": "In a woodland vast, where moonlit shadows creep,  \nThere dwelt a creature of wisdom deep.  \nA noble owl, by name of Sage,  \nPerched high upon an ancient page,  \nWhere boughs did whisper secrets of the night,  \nAnd stars did dance with silv'ry light.\n\nYon forest teemed with beasts both great and small,  \nYet sought they not the owl who knew them all.  \nFor wise was Sage, with eyes that gleaned  \nThe hidden truths that others had not dreamed.  \nIn still of night, when he took flight,  \nHis silent wings did part the ebon light.\n\nNow hear, dear reader, of a humble hare,  \nWho blithely leapt 'neath Sage's nightly care.  \nIt chanced that danger sought the hare one eve,  \nAs cunning fox intent did weaveâ€”  \nTo snare the hare in bonds unseen,  \nYet to the light Sage's eye did keen.\n\nTo thine ears I tell of words thus spoke,  \nIn voice as soft as tender oak:  \n\"Halt thy steps, yon hare fleet and fair,  \nLest thou be snared in luring lair.  \nJourney not the wooded path alone,  \nFor peril lies where the fox's shadow is thrown.\"\n\nIn heed of Sage's wisdom vast,  \nThe hare did swiftly, prudent ask:  \n\"O kindly sage, where shall I safely flee,  \nThat no harm nor fox may come to me?\"  \nQuoth Sage with gentle wisdom bold,  \n\"Seek thy shelter 'neath the willow's fold.\"\n\nThus guided by the owl's gentle lore,  \nThe hare did bound securely to the forest's floor,  \nAnd there beneath the willow's kindly shade,  \nIn peace and safety, there he stayed.  \nHenceforth, all creatures, great and small,  \nLearned favors wrought by wisdom's call.\n\nThus ends the fable, a tale to weave,  \nOf Owl and Hare in sylvan eve,  \n'Tis wisdom, dear reader, that doth shine bright,  \nA guiding star through the shadowed night.",
