  "coverage": "In yonder verdant woods, where doth the shadows play ‘pon the visage of the moonlit ground, there came a most beguiling sight—an encounter with a creature of fabled tales. The night was serene, and the whispering wind didst converse 'mongst the ancient trees. As I wandered, laden with thoughts of mortal life, a sudden rustle didst part the silence like a bard's sudden cry. \n\nBefore mine eyes, in glist'ring hues, appeared a sylvan beast, a unicorn most rare, its horn doth pierce the night with ethereal luminescence. Its mane did flow like rivers of liquid silver, and gentle was its breath, a balm to mine agitated spirit. \n\nThis noble creature, untouched by the hands of time, didst prance amidst the shadows, yet left no mark upon the mossy earth. It beheld me with eyes, deep as the abyssal sea, yet warm with ancient wisdom. I knelt 'fore this paragon of nature, my heart in thrall, for 'twas as if the stars themselves had unto earth descended.\n\nWith a neigh that resounded as a sweet melody, the unicorn didst beckon me to rise. My spirit 'twas lightened, and my soul didst soar, for in that moment—unshackled from the world's grasp—I knewest the touch of the divine.\n\nAnon, as comet doth vanish from the firmament, the creature turned, melting into the forest's embrace, leaving naught but a whisper of magic in its wake. Thereupon, I didst return whence I came, bearing in mine heart the indelible memory of a night so wondrous, wherein I glimpsed the very essence of nature’s sacred mystery.",
