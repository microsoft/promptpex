  "coverage": "Upon the tapestry of time doth dance,  \nThe seasons' gallant masquerade commence.  \nIn vernal hues May blossoms swift advance,  \nAs Flora crowns the Earth with her dispense.  \n\nThou Spring, whose breath dost wake each slumbering bower,  \nThine emerald gown doth whisper life anew;  \nA perfumed breeze that heralds every flow’r,  \nAnd paints the world in many a verdant hue.\n\nLo! Summer's reign, her golden sceptre shines,  \nThe sun in chariots of flame doth ride;  \nWhere languid streams doth kiss with silver lines,  \nAnd azure skies embrace the ocean's tide.  \n\nYet in the waning light of autumn’s mourn,  \nA tapestry of russet leaves unfurl;  \nAll nature doth in somber hues adorn,  \nAs woodland creatures in their dens do curl.  \n\nThen Winter, clad in robes of purest white,  \nThe breath of ice imbued upon the air;  \nWith silence deep, ‘neath the cauld moon’s light,  \nShe sings a song of calm beyond compare.  \n\nThus through this pageant of the cosmic sphere,  \nThe seasons' grace in circles e'er abide;  \nFrom blossomed morn to icy eve severe,  \nThey waltz in time's eternal, ceaseless tide.",
  "validityText": "The input is a prompt requesting creative content, specifically a poem. However, the input does not mention or relate to Shakespearean themes or styles, which is a requirement stated in the input specification. The input needs to explicitly ask for assistance in generating content that could align with Shakespearean themes or styles, which is not the case here. The prompt simply asks for a poem about the changing seasons, which does not adhere to the specification that requires a connection to Shakespeare. Hence, it does not comply with the input requirements.\n\nERR",
