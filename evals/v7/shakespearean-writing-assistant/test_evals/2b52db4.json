  "coverage": "Upon this verdant earth in days of yore,\nThere lived a gallant knight of noble grace,\nSir Edmund, stout of heart and firm of yore,\nWhose deeds did echo through the time and space.\nTo him, the king in counsel gravely spake:\n\"A darkness looms 'ere the forest so deep,\nWhere sunlight fears to tread, and shadows wake,\nBring light wherein the twisted night doth creep.\"\n\nThus armored with steel and purpose bold,\nSir Edmund embarks, his steed strong and true,\nWith lance in hand and heart of purest gold,\nTo breach the woodland's secrets dark and new.\nThe forest lords were not of humble kind,\nWith ancient trees that whispered tales of woe,\nIn branches' creaks, the restless spirits pined,\nFor vengeance 'gainst mortals who dared to go.\n\nThrough thickets dense and winding paths untried,\nWhere moonlight dances with the fleeting mist,\nOur knight doth press where gory shadows hide,\nHis courage steadfast, by no fear dismissed.\nIn clearing wide, a cavern gaped profound,\nFrom whence did issue a miasma foul,\nYet bravely still his noble steed did bound,\nAnd there did Sir Edmund his courage avow.\n\n\"Ye foul beasts and spirits of the gloom,\nI challenge thee to cease thy nightly raid,\nCome forth and face thy rightful, fateful doom,\nBy honor's light shall thy menacing fade.\"\nAnd from the depths arose a dragon old,\nIts scales as midnight, eyes like embers hot,\nAnd 'twixt these foes a battle fierce they told,\nWhere magic clashed with steel in mortal plot.\n\nSir Edmund's valor, like a star's bright flame,\nDid pierce the veil of darkness circled round,\nThe dragon felled, to dust returned its claim,\nAnd silence fell o'er the erstwhile battleground.\nThus did the knight emerge from forest's maw,\nThe light of dawn, his triumph to bestow,\nA hero wrapped in noble legend's awe,\nThe forest freed from shadows' deathly show.\n\nReturneth he to tales extolled in might,\nCrowned with valor and the forestâ€™s grace,\nSir Edmund, knight of unyielding light,\nOf whom the bards eternal songs embrace.",
