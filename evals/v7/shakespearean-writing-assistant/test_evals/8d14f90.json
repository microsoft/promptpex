  "coverage": "When autumn's breath doth paint the leafy boughs,  \nIn gold and crimson hues o'er vale and hill,  \nThe gentle whisper of the zephyr vows,  \nTo usher cold with winter's icy chill.  \n\nThe summer’s warmth abideth now no more,  \nFor winter's frost doth usurp sunlit reign,  \nFair flora hides for spring to thee restore,  \nNew life to maketh o'er the vernal plain.  \n\nYet now the snows doth blanket all the land,  \nIn purity unmatched and silence deep,  \nThe world doth rest beneath its brumal hand,  \nIn dreams of life anew and chrysalis sleep.  \n\nThen shall sweet breezes of the springtime sing,  \nTo waken earth with promises of spring.",
