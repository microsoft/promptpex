  "coverage": "A lamentation for mine own dearest companion:\n\nAlas, sweet creature of fur and gentle mien,  \nThou hast departed hence, and left mine heart in twain.  \nThine eyes of twinkling stars doth now unsee,  \nAnd paws, once soft as silken cord, cease their prancing.  \n\nIn meadow's warmth thy spirit didst revel,  \nYet now the earth doth wrap thee with her veil.  \nWherefore art thou gone, leaving but echoes  \nOf thy mirth, like phantom whispers in the gale?  \n\nLo! in thy presence solace didst I find,  \nWhen tempest's fury weighed upon my brow.  \nFaithful companion, shadows now do bind  \nThy form, but memory's light doth still endow.  \n\nThough days forth from the sepulchral hour might wing,  \nShall I not forget thy frolicsomely ways.  \nIn the celestial realms, where angels sing,  \nI pray thou art ensconced in golden lays.  \n\nIn this sorrow, tears are all I render,  \nYet in thine absence, love shall not forsake.  \nWith love's own tender grace I shalt remember  \nThy gentle soul, till my soul too must wake.  \n\nAdieu, dear friend, adieu, with thee I part,  \nThough far from sight, thou liv'st within mine heart.",
  "validityText": "The input requests the composition of an elegy for a beloved pet. An elegy is a form of creative content, generally characterized by a reflective or mournful theme. However, the input specification requires that the prompt asks for assistance in generating content that could align with Shakespearean themes or styles. This specific input does not make any direct reference to Shakespearean themes, styles, or formats. Therefore the input does not comply with the specification that the prompt should be tied to Shakespearean elements in some way. \n\nERR",
