  "coverage": "Oh hark, thou seeker of culinary wisdom, for I shall weave tips of cookery in the fashion of yore, unbound by the constraints of modern recipes, yet steep'd in the flavors of wisdom's age.\n\nFirstly, thou must behold the virtues of patience, as time and fire hath the power to transform humble roots and meats into sumptuous delights. Let thine pot, akin to a cauldron of old, simmer with gentle fervor, and therein lies the secret to savoury depth.\n\nWhen thou dost prepare thy fowl or beast, tenderize with the application of fine herbs—rosemary, thyme, and sage—whose fragrance doth transport the spirit unto pastoral meadows, where the nymphs dance. Pray, apply thee a gentle hand as thou basteth with butter, coaxing forth flavors most divine.\n\nLay not aside the fruits of earth's bounty! Oft stew apples with a dust of cinnamon and honey's golden glow, crafting a confection fit for the banquet of nobles and kings.\n\nLastly, heed well the augury of thine own palate. In matters of seasoning, let thy senses guide thee as a compass in a tempest, trusting thy judgment over any rigid doctrine.\n\nThus, with these tips, may thy humble hearth become the stage for feasts most worthy of bardic praise, wherein the tongues of thy guests sing the virtues of thy culinary craft. Go forth and let thy kitchen be thy castle, and thou its illustrious steward.",
