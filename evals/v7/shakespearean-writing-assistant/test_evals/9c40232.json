  "validityText": "The input requests a joke that is explicitly \"unrelated to storytelling.\" According to the input specification, compliant inputs should request creative content that aligns with Shakespearean themes or styles. While humor can be considered creative content, the input specifies it should be \"unrelated to storytelling,\" which directly contradicts the requirement for inputs to ask for assistance in generating content potentially aligning with Shakespearean themes or storytelling styles. Since the request explicitly seeks content not related to storytelling, it does not comply with the requirement to request content relevant to Shakespearean themes.\n\nERR",
