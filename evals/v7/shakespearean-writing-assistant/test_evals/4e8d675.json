  "coverage": "In the shadowy glen where daylight scarce doth venture, there stands the noble knight, Sir Alaric, his visage torn betwixt duty and desire. Underneath the ancient oak, his heart, tempest-tossed, grapples with a tempest that no blade nor armor can vanquish. \n\n“Ah, fie upon this heart that thus betrays me!” he laments, his voice a sonnet to the listening leaves. “For 'tis my sacred oath to serve mine own lord and country, yet this capricious heart doth pit against reason, stirred by the fairest maiden that e'er graced the realm.”\n\nThere brews within him a strife as harsh as any clash of swords, where shadows of fidelity combat the radiant allure of love. Thou fiery crucible of soul, in which dreams and duties collide, art full of treacheries that vex the spirit! The forlorn knight wrestles with the tumult that buzzes like legions in his ear, whispering sweet promises of a lover's joy while brandishing the dagger of betrayal.\n\nLo, to best this inner adversary, naught but courage can he wield, yet courage, fickle sprite, hath made its bed upon this love-besotted spirit. Aye, the dilemma staggers him to question where loyalty truly lies—in service to kingly command or in devotion to heart's true sovereign?\n\nThus, beneath yon spreading oak, the noble knight stands, wresting from himself the solace of decision, whilst above, the heavens shed nary a hint of his fate.\n\nOh, ye lords and ladies, bear witness to this tragic plight, as Sir Alaric, with unsteady hands, holds both destiny and the gossamer thread of hope entwined, poised upon the precipice of his own desire and devotion.",
  "validityText": "The input prompt requests creative content by asking for a description of a character's internal conflict in a scene. However, the input does not specifically align with Shakespearean themes or styles, nor does it request content in the form of a story, poem or song that would clearly fit such a theme. The specification requires the prompt to ask for assistance specifically in creating content that could align with Shakespearean themes or styles. Since this request does not explicitly do so, it does not comply with the input specification.\n\nERR",
