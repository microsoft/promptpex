  "coverage": "In lands beyond the ken of mortal sight,  \nWhere mountains kiss the sky and stars with light,  \nThere dwelt a giant, broad of chest and strong,  \nHis voice akin to deepest thunder's song.  \nUpon the selfsame verdant vale there lived,  \nA dwarf of kindly heart, with wisdom thrived.  \n\nThough stature did divide these comrades twain,  \nA bond of friendship, true, did ever reign.  \nGreat Goliath, towering o'er the peaks,  \nHis laughter rang, and joy he'd ever seek.  \nWhile Diminutive Darnel, swift and spry,  \nWith nimble step did dance 'neath azure sky.  \n\nIn revelry they oft would pass their days,  \nThrough sylvan glades and meadows' sunny blaze.  \nWith Goliath's might, he’d lift young Darnel high,  \nAnd turn his gaze unto the eagles nigh.  \nThe dwarf, in turn, would stories weave aloud,  \nOf ancient lore and deeds that made hearts proud.  \n\nTheir union, a tapestry of nether charms,  \nWove strong 'gainst tempest’s wrath and dire harms.  \nNe'er did discord betwixt these friends arise,  \nFor each did cherish truth with open eyes.  \nIn figs of thine countenance, marking time’s tread,  \nA friendship strong, unmarred by fear or dread.  \n\nThus, let all who hear this tale of loyal kin,  \nEmbrace the bond of he who dwells within.  \nFor giants and dwarves alike, when hearts align,  \nAre kindred joined by friendship's sacred sign.  \nIn times of mirth and moments that inspire,  \nMay all find comradeship such as they require.
