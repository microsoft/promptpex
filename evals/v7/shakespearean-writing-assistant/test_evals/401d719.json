  "coverage": "Oh youthful vigor, likened to the spring,  \nIn whose fresh breath doth Nature's chorus sing.  \nThy fervent spirit like the dawning day,  \nAwakes the earth, and chases night away.  \n\nThou art the verdant bloom on tender boughs,  \nWith promises of life, each heart endows.  \nIn vibrant hues dost thou on canvas paint,  \nA glowing palette that shall ne'er grow faint.  \n\nYet fleeting art thou, youth, as springtime's grace,  \nWith gentle pace dost whisper forth thy chase.  \nAs blossom fair must yield to fruit's embrace,  \nSo shall thy season change with time's slow pace.  \n\nThus treasure these sweet days of tender bloom,  \nEre summer's breath doth bid thee swift resume.  ",
