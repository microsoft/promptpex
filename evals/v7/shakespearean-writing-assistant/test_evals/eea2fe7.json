  "coverage": "In yonder halls where parchment doth decoy,  \nA scribe there dwells, a lad of clumsy gait,  \nWith quill in hand, he oft becomes a toy,  \nAs inked blots doth on his scrolls await.  \n\nBehold, the bard of fumbles and of stains,  \nA gentle scribbler who thy mirth incites,  \nHis elbows doth o'er letters leave domain,  \nWhilst spilling pools of dark on words he writes.   \n\nHis spectacles, askew, doth cause him blind,  \n'Tis truth he seeks, but clumsiness he finds,  \nFor every tale he pens hath humorous wind,  \nAnd every script a jest he unwinds.  \n\nHe oft miscalls a king with scurvy names,  \nTransforming lordly edicts into games.  \nYet o'er the parchment wasteth not in shame,  \nBut riseth up, still laughing, and proclaims:  \n\n\"O Muse! Be kindest in thy giddy wrath,  \nLet not my hand be villain to thy path.  \nForclumsy scribes still read with joyful laugh,  \nWhile tales of folly dance in merry bath!\"",
  "validityText": "The input is a prompt that requests creative content, specifically a humorous verse about a clumsy scribe. However, it does not specifically ask for content that aligns with Shakespearean themes or styles, which is a requirement according to the input specification. The prompt doesn't mention any Shakespearean elements such as themes, styles, or references, and thus does not directly comply with the requirement to involve Shakespearean aspects.\n\nERR",
