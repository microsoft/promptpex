  "coverage": "**Act I, Scene II**\n\n*A chamber in an ancient university, adorned with tomes of wisdom. Two learned scholars, Sir Edward and Lady Isabella, stand poised to discourse upon the opulent matter of love.*\n\n**Sir Edward:**\nGood morrow, Lady Isabella, wise and fair,\nWith quill in hand and heart borne light as air.\nPray, let us delve into that mystic art,\nWhich bindeth soul to soul, and heart to heart.\nWhat say'st thou of love's nature, true and pure,\nA passion strong, or but a fleeting lure?\n\n**Lady Isabella:**\nMost noble sir, thy words doth stir my mind,\nTo ponder o'er emotions deeply twined.\nLove's visage is, methinks, both sweet and wild,\nA tempest's fury and a gentle child.\nDost thou not see how it doth oft beguile,\nWith promises that sweeten e’en the trial?\n\n**Sir Edward:**\nIndeed, dear lady, thy insight is bright,\nYet, can we deem if love be true or slight?\nIs it a fire borne from providence fair,\nOr but a wanton folly, light as air?\nMethinks, in truth, the heart's unsteady course,\nIs led by oaths which oft from folly source.\n\n**Lady Isabella:**\nAnd yet, dear sir, what joy it doth impart,\nWhen matched by two who share a single heart.\nA bond that time nor tempest can suspend,\nIn such divine embrace, the soul doth mend.\nWith roses red and poesy arrayed,\nIn love's warm light, mortal souls are swayed.\n\n**Sir Edward:**\nExchange of words most eloquent and wise,\nYet can we trust what hides 'neath lover's guise?\nFor many a heart hath drifted 'pon the seas,\nWith broken sails and shattered reveries.\nThus, dare I say, in caution love embarks,\nGuided by stars, not flitting in the dark.\n\n**Lady Isabella:**\nAh, prudence is thy counsel, strong and sage,\nYet love, to me, remains love's truest gauge.\nFor 'tis the muse that doth the heavens move,\nAnd gives to art and song their fervent groove.\nIn matters of the heart, let us concede,\n‘Tis oft as fickle as it is decreed.\n\n**Sir Edward:**\nThen let our learned dispute end in accord,\nLove is both heaven's bliss and sly discord.\nA dual nature spun of silken thread,\nThat weaves through life till life itself be sped.\nFair lady, in this courtly battle won,\nWe find that love is two, yet one.\n\n**Lady Isabella:**\nThus, let us toast to love, in all its plight,\nBe it both darksome storm and purest light.\nAnd may our hearts, with wisdom's flame entwined,\nSeek love's true course, in compass vast and kind.\n\n*Exeunt scholars, the matter debated in courteous harmony, with wisdom gleaned and hearts alight with the essence of love's enigmatic nature.*",
