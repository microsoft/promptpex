As the golden orb of day did rise, beholden I was upon a morn most peculiar, beset by Neptune’s own breath, a tempest fierce and unabiding, that did bid me stay within chambers cloistered.\n\nUpon mine limbs, a languor unseen did doth alight, as if enchanted by Puck’s mischievous touch, rendering them as leaden as the helm of day’s own knight. It was then that I, poor soul, besieged by stupor, found my faculties bound in slumber’s sweet embrace, till the hour of noon had passed its zenith.\n\nAh, dear master or mistress of our humble dwelling, prithee let thine heart be moved by mine account, and pardon this transgression, for ‘tis borne of circumstances beyond mortal governance or reason’s sway. Thy clemency shall be unto me a boon most cherished, and tomorrow, with vigor full restored, thy servant I remain, diligent as e’er in all choreful endeavor.\n\nThus, humbly I submit this plea,\nThine ever faithful servant, me.",
