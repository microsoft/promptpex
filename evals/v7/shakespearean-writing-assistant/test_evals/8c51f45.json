  "validityText": "The input requested the depiction of a crowning of a new monarch, which suggests a request for creative content. However, the input specification requires that prompts should specifically request assistance in generating content that could align with Shakespearean themes or styles. The user's prompt does not explicitly ask for content that aligns with Shakespearean themes or styles. While the crowning of a new monarch could potentially be interpreted as a theme present in some of Shakespeare's works, the prompt itself does not request or imply this context directly or explicitly. Therefore, the input does not fully comply with the requirement to align with Shakespearean themes or styles.\n\nERR",
