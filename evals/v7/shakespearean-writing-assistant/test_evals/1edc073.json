  "coverage": "In the midst of yon churning tempestuous night, when the moon doth hide behind its veil of shadowy clouds, a mysterious stranger, clad in somber robes and with eyes that shone like the orbs of ancient seers, did appear upon the threshold of the moss-laden tavern. Therein, by the flick'ring glow of the hearth's embers, a tale of prophetic nature was unraveled, leaving all who gathered round with hearts betwixt wonder and dread.\n\n\"Attend to my words, O ye of this fair hamlet,\" spoke he with a voice that echoed as though from realms beyond mortal ken, \"For a prophecy hath been bestowed upon mine lips, as was foretold by the ancients in scrolls now lost to time. A king shall rise when the harvest moon proclaimeth its yellow court in the heavens thrice over. He of humble origins shall wield a sword fashioned from the starlit strands of the firmament itself.\"\n\n\"Yet heed well, ere the crown doth grace his brow, the land shall tremble under the footfalls of a dread beast, a creature woven of the whispered fears of night. Only by the courage of the few and steadfast unity shall peace be restored and the light of dawn shall banish the specter of despair.\"\n\n\"O heed thou well this portent, goodly folk, and let not thine spirits falter when the hours grow dark. For in the hands of thine hope and valor resteth the fate of both king and country.\"\n\nThus spake the stranger, and with naught but the whisper of turning leaves he vanished into the night, leaving nary a trace but the echo of his ominous proclamation that lingered long within the air.",
