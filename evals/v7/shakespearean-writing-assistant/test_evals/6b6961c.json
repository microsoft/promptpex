  "coverage": "Scene: A moonlit garden, with tall cypress trees casting long shadows upon the ground. The whispering wind carries the sound of nightingales singing their mournful tunes. The lovers, Elara and Lysander, stand beneath the boughs, their eyes filled with unspoken sorrow.\n\nElara:\nO cruel Fate, why must thou rend asunder\nThese hearts that beat as one beneath night's shroud?\nWhat sin have we committed, sweetest wonder,\nTo draw thy wrath upon us as a cloud?\nMy dearest Lysander, night wends away,\nYet love's bright flame shall ne'er see light of day.\n\nLysander:\nFair Elara, thou bearest grief most rare,\nYet it is Fate's harsh whisper we must heedâ€”\nFor Heaven's decree, though silent as the air,\nBinds us with threads of dire and dismal need.\nThough distance doth upon our hearts impose,\nYet in our dreams shall meet we where love grows.\n\nElara:\nBut shall the bitter winds of parting freeze\nThe tender vows once warmed by summer's sun?\nDoth not the brook still murmur 'neath the trees,\nThough 'tis no longer visible, anon?\nOur souls, though parted by Fate's iron might,\nShall linger as one 'neath the stars' soft light.\n\nLysander:\nTrue love, thy words do soothe the raging storm\nThat seethes within this breast like tempests wild;\nI see within thine eyes a deeper warm,\nA light that keeps us 'gainst the world's beguile.\nCome, let us seal our pledge beneath the night,\nAnd thus our hearts shall ne'er succumb to blight.\n\n(He takes her hand, and they exchange tokens - a ribbon and a ring)\n\nElara:\nWith this token, my heart I give to thee,\n'Tis but a humble thing, yet love's true guide;\nKeep it close, e'en when we are ceaselessly\nCleft as by the sea's ever turning tide.\nIn dreams I'll meet thee, where the stars do dance,\nAnd our hearts shall twine in love's sacred trance.\n\nLysander:\nThis ring, though wrought in simple gold doth gleam,\nIs but a fraction of the love I hold;\nWear it, dearest, e'en as the stars do dream,\nIts circle endless, like my love untold.\nThus part we now, but let no tears divide,\nFor through all time, love shall our hearts abide.\n\n(With one last embrace, they part, each turning down a separate path, the night bearing witness to their silent vows. The sound of a distant church bell tolls, echoing their sorrow through the night air.)",
