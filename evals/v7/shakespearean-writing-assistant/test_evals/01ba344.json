  "coverage": "Fellow warriors of noble heart and valiant spirit, lend thine ears to the fervent call that draweth near, for destiny and duty beckon us to stand united in the face of ominous peril. Behold the field whereon the fates of men doth intertwine with glory's thread, where each soul shall make its noble mark 'pon this earthly stage.\n\nGather round, ye knights of courage, whose resolve shineth brighter than Helios's light, and gird thyselves with courage deep as the ocean's vast embrace. Hath we not sworn an oath before Heavens high to defend with unwavering fervor the land we cherish so? For this land, kissed by the benevolent hand of fundament, whose very earth doth breathe the whispers of our ancestors, hath need of our steadfast hearts.\n\nLet not fear creep into thy bones, for ‘tis but a shadowy specter that withers ‘neath the clarity of thy purpose. Arm thyselves with valor and steely resolve, for on this day, every sword and shield shall sing a chorus of defiance ‘gainst those who dawseth to darken our realm. Lo, the storm of war may rage ‘round our heads, yet know, dear kin, that the bonds we share be the armor bedight with truth and honor immutable.\n\nIn yon hour, when the clarion doth sound its resounding note, mark thee well, my steely kin, and let thy feet not falter but march with pride unwavering. Take heed the call of thy beating hearts, which doth echo the ancient song of freedom and kinship true. Each heart herein doth contribute to the tapestry of victory’s glorious design, and knowith well that in thine efforts, heaven itself shall shine through our deeds.\n\nNow go, with spirit unyielding, to the field where fate awaits. Let our courage be the beacon that guideth us through the shadowed veil, and know thou, dear warriors, that history shall remember thee, sung in the hymns of everlasting honor. Charge forth, for honor, for hope, for home!\n\nThus I invoke, let courage be thy guide! Battle steadfastly, and frag not ‘til victory grips thee, for united we stand, as the unbreakable shield against all who oppose. For our kingdom, for our kin, for victory shall be ours!\n\nHark and heed, my gallant band; onward, to glory everlasting!",
