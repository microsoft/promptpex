  "coverage": "Behold, thou noble soul, the bustling scene of market thronged,  \nWhere merchants ply their wares with voices raised 'mongst throng.  \nIn lively chorus markt now echoeth, a vibrant song,  \nIn hues and scents enchanting, the breadth, the soul belong.  \n\nHere doth the cobblestones, with myriad footsteps dance,  \nAs tradesmen cry their offerings in lively countenance.  \nOf silken thread and spices rare, their tones doth thus entrance,  \nWhilst laughter and the talk of coin weave mystic circumstance.  \n\nLo! See the fruits that glisten 'neath the morning's golden glow,  \nThe fresh'ning flow'rets blossom, colors in ebb and flow.  \nThe baker's loaves warm from the oven he doth bestow,  \nWhilst children, joyous, play about, in innocence they know.  \n\nMark how the air is rich with scent, a fragrant bal'my air,  \nOf roasted nuts and honey'd sweets, attend — oft linger there.  \nThe blacksmith's forge sings with the sparks of glowing fire's flare,  \nHe worketh hard with hammer’s clang, his trusty craft declare.  \n\nIn every corner of this splendid, chaotic fair,  \nThe pulse of life beats strong and vibrant, with passion it doth bare.  \nA tapestry of mortal kind, enmeshed in sacred share,  \nThe market held in learned embrace, where tales of life ensnare.  \n\nSo muse upon this busy scene, replete with human plight,  \nWhere dreams converse and fortunes twist beneath the day's fair light.  \nThe market stands a testament to commerce’ bold delight,  \nA merry end o’ week ensueth, ‘pon twilight’s dappled rite.",
