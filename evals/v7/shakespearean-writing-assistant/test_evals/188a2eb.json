  "coverage": "In yon hustling city, where brick and spire doth scrape the vault of heaven itself, the gentle breath of spring maketh merry with the crowd. Lo, the city awakes from winter's harsh embrace as Flora, in all her verdant glory, spreads forth her emerald carpet 'neath the feet of man. \n\nHark, how the sweet notes of chirping larks do pierce the clamor of the street, as if to announce the arrival of the fair season. The once pallid cheeks of the populace now bloom like the rose, kissed by the sun's warm rays. Behold how the merchants, in gay attire, doth display their wares whilst the fragrant scent of blossoms doth mingle with the smell of freshly baked loaf.\n\nThe riverside walk, where once frozen still, now runs with laughter as swains and damsels do stroll, their spirits lifted by the zephyr's gentle caress. 'Tis there, amidst the merry throng, that the painted tulips do dance and sway, whilst children doth play 'neath the watchful eye of the mighty oak.\n\nIn every corner, art thou met with the vibrant tapestry of life renewed. The theatres do throng with eager patrons, eager to witness comedies as bright as the noonday sun. In gardens, minstrels tune their lutes, weaving melodies as sweet and delicate as the petals that flutter to the ground in shy delight.\n\nThus doth the bustling city, in all its bustling might, don its garment fresh woven by spring, an ode to the season's generous heart. Let us therefore with mirth and gratitude, praise this vernal festival, for in its embrace, life's delicate beauty doth return to dance upon the world's grand stage.",
