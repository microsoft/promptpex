  "coverage": "Scene: A humble drawing room adorned with damask draperies and faint candlelight. Enter Sir Lodrick and Lady Elsinore, seeking evening diversion upon the goggle-box.\n\nSir Lodrick: Good morrow, fairest Elsinore, thy visage with day's longing hath charmed mine eyes. Prithee, what spectacle shalt thou wish to grace upon the magickal tube this eve?\n\nLady Elsinore: My noble Lodrick, in troth, a choice perplexing doth my heart confound. Wouldst thou a comedy, to cheer our spirits with laughter's gentle mirth? Or a drama bedecked with intrigue to ensnare our wandering thoughts?\n\nSir Lodrick: Methinks a comedy would suit our humour well, for the day's labours hath sorely taxed my soul. Yet, perchance, a tale of suspense might enthrall our senses, weaving us into its mystic web.\n\nLady Elsinore: True, thy words doth strike a chord, dear Lodrick. Shall we thus peruse yon list of available spectacles to unveil that which striketh our fancy?\n\nSir Lodrick: Aye, let us cast our eyes upon this catalogue, a vast sea of delights unsailed. Ah, here, 'tis “The Office,” a jester’s art, renowned for mirth and folly.\n\nLady Elsinore: Indeed, 'tis heralded far and wide. Yet what sayest thou to “Game of Thrones,” a tapestry of kingdoms far and wide, where betrayal and honour doth dance their perilous dance?\n\nSir Lodrick: A conundrum wears the guise of both fair and foul. Still, I am swayed by laughter gentle; lightness appeals to souls wearied by tumult and cares.\n\nLady Elsinore: Then let us partake of jocund laughter, and allow our cares to waft away like dandelion wishes on the summer breeze.\n\nSir Lodrick: So be it, fairest. Together shall we embark upon this whimsy quest, where harlequins and jesters do linger.\n\n[He maneuvers the magickal remote, and the moving paintings flicker to life, filling the chamber with animated scenes.]\n\nLady Elsinore: Now, dearest Lodrick, we shall while away the hours in a realm where laughter doth reign as sovereign high!\n\n[They recline upon the divan, their faces illuminated by the flickering light of their chosen mirth.]\n\nExeunt.",
