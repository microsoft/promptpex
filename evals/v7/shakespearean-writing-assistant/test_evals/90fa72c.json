  "coverage": "In yon great hall where splendor reigneth bright,  \nLayeth the feast before the sovereign's sight.  \nThe high king sits upon his gilded throne,  \nRobed in the silks by foreign empires known.  \n\nTables adorned with cloth of gold so fine,  \nAnd goblets brimmed with ruby-red of wine.  \nRich viands served from distant lands, and nigh,  \nDo please the senses and delight the eye.  \n\nUpon the trestle boards, the peacock proud,  \nWith plumage splayed like painted rainbow cloud  \nAmongst the suckling pig and roasted swan,  \nA bounty only fit for royaltyâ€™s dawn.  \n\nMinstrelsy fills the air with dulcet tune,  \nAnd jesters doth their antics oft attune.  \nThe courtiers, dressed in garments richly spun,  \nSpeaketh in whispers 'neath the chandelier's sun.  \n\nLaughter and mirth o'erpow'r the nightly chime,  \nThe banquet placeth all in merry time.  \nThe monarch smiles, his gaze beheld the scene,  \nFor naught but harmony shall e'er intervene.  \n\nThus, in this court, the harvest shared, divine,  \nGiveth thanks to fortune's favor so benign.  \nAs candles flicker and shadows softly sway,  \nThe night proceeds till the first light of day.",
