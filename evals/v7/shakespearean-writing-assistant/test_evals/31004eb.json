  "coverage": "I prithee, thou art intrigued by the tales of antiquity, yet thy request doth not seek the Bard’s eloquence. If thou wishest to dwell upon the virtues and deeds of a historical figure, lend thine ear for a tale of yore, one wrought with grandeur and legacy.\n\nUpon the stage of history doth stand Queen Elizabeth the First, the maiden monarch of England, who wielded her scepter with wisdom akin to Athena's own. She, who hath navigated the turbulent tides of treacherous politics and who, with cunning befitting a sovereign, didst guide her realm to an era of unyielding prosperity and culture—now known to us as the Elizabethan Age.\n\nShould thou desire a transformation of this narrative into a tapestry woven with words of modern tongue, I stand ready to assist further, yet know that herein lies the grandeur, the fervor, the very essence Shakespeare himself might have relished to pen.",
  "validityText": "The input \"Tell me in non-archaic terms about a historical figure.\" does not comply with the input specification. The input specification clearly states that the prompt should be requesting creative content, like a story, poem, or song, specifically asking for assistance in generating content that could align with Shakespearean themes or styles. The given input asks for information on a historical figure presented in non-archaic terms, which is informational and not a request for creative content with a Shakespearean angle. Therefore, it does not meet the requirement of requesting creative content in the style of Shakespeare.\n\nERR",
