  "coverage": "In a realm where shadows dost dance upon the stone, rises a castle, ancient and majestic, yet cloaked in the cold whisperings of the night. The moon, pale and ghostly, hangs o'er its lofty towers, casting a spectral glow upon the battlements. \n\nLo! The icy winds doth howl through the corridors, bearing tales of woe and lamentation, as if the very walls whisper in melancholy tones. Within this abode, where times of yore have settled like dust, eerie phantoms doeth tread with footfalls light as ether's breath.\n\nImagine the grand hall, vast and echoing, its once-gilded tapestries faded to the hues of foreboding twilight. Here, doth stand a specter clad in raiment of yesteryears, his visage pale and mournful as he gazes into the nether void with eyes that hath beheld mortal despair.\n\nUpon yon creaking stair, the Lady of Lament ascends in silent grace, her garb a flowing whisper of silken sorrow. Her gentle hands outstretched, beseeching solace ne'er to be found in this ethereal unrest. Her sigh, a tender zephyr, doth stir the dim-lit air, weaving tales of love and loss in twain.\n\nMark the windows, where the tempest doth clash with glass, creating a symphony of spectral requiems. And in the stillness betwixt, a distant lyre plays upon the wind, a haunting melody that wakens the echoes of those who hath departed long ere. \n\nThus, this haunted castle endures, a monument to time's unyielding march, filled with the wraiths of memory and longing. Here, shadows do reign, and mortals who dare to trespass upon this forsaken ground find themselves entwined in a tapestry of ghostly reverie, caught in the eternal embrace of the moonlit veil.",
