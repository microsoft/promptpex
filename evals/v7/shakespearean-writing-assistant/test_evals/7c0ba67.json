  "coverage": "In the realm of dreams where visions strange unfold,\nA tapestry of wonder bright unfurls,\nWhere creatures of a mythic hue their tales extol,\nAnd weave a dance amidst the midnight pearls.\n\nIn slumber deep, where mind doth roam unbridled,\nA dreamscape vast doth greet the weary soul,\nWhere faeries flit with wings of silver gilded,\nAnd unicorns in moonlit meadows stroll.\n\nBehold the sirens, singing 'neath the waves,\nTheir voices sweet like nectar of the gods,\nThey lured me with a song betwixt the caves,\nWhilst merfolk played upon their sacred rods.\n\nThe griffon royal soared through skies of night,\nWith eyes like molten gold, it watched o'er all,\nIts plumage rich and mane like fire alight,\nAnd heralded the dawn with piercing call.\n\nA dragon fierce with scales of emerald green\nDid guard a hoard within the ancient hills,\nIts breath a flame that none hath e'er seen,\nAnd 'neath its might, the very earth stood still.\n\nAs morning light did pierce the dream's fa√ßade,\nEach creature faded like the mists of yore,\nYet in mine heart, their presence hath been awed,\nTheir memories live till dreams call once more.\n\nThus in the world of visions wrapped in night,\nThese mythical kin doth claim their sovereign place,\nIn dreams where mortals and legends unite,\nTo dance the steps of time's eternal chase.",
  "validityText": "The input is a prompt requesting creative content. It asks for the creation of content involving a vivid dream with mythical creatures. However, the input does not explicitly request content that aligns with Shakespearean themes or styles, which is a requirement according to the input specification. The specification clearly states that the input must ask for assistance in generating content that could align with Shakespearean themes or styles. Therefore, the absence of an explicit reference to Shakespearean themes or styles indicates non-compliance with this rule.\n\nERR",
