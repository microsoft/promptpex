  "coverage": "Oh, dearest heart, as I to battle fly,  \nLend me thy hand one last, sweet, soft embrace,  \nFor parting thus doth pierce mine own heart's eye,  \nAnd leaves me bound by memory's gentle grace.  \n\nThe trumpet sound bids me into the fray,  \nWhere courage falters not on fields of dread.  \nYet fret not, love, for fleeting is the day  \nWhen triumph leads me safe to our shared bed.  \n\nKeep watch o'er thy heart, my truest delight,  \nAs stars keep vigil 'pon the ebon night.  \nThough we must severed be by war's dark might,  \nOur souls doth bind with love’s immortal light.  \n\nIn dreams, I’ll cross the spanning gulf of time,  \nAnd whisper sonnets sweet into thy sleep.  \nTill fate returns me, thus in rhythm’d rhyme,  \nMy soul e'er thine to hold and e’er to keep.  \n\nFarewell, mine own sweet rose, till fortune’s wheel  \nDoth turn our tethered hearts of iron and steel.",
