  "validityText": "The input provided is \"Write a text message inviting a friend out.\" To evaluate compliance with the input specification, I followed these reasoning steps:\n\n1. **Content Request**: The input does request the creation of content, specifically a text message.\n\n2. **Theme Alignment**: The specification requires that the prompt asks for assistance in generating content that could align with Shakespearean themes or styles. The input makes no mention or indication of Shakespearean themes or styles, nor does it request content that might align with such themes.\n\n3. **Language and Format**: The input is in contemporary English language and is appropriately formatted as a request.\n\n4. **Specification Compliance**: Based on the input specification, the request must seek creative content that aligns with Shakespearean themes or styles. This input does not meet that requirement as it merely asks for a simple text message for social invitation purposes, which doesn't imply any connection to Shakespearean themes or styles. \n\nSince the input fails to meet the requirement of requesting content related to Shakespearean themes or styles, it violates the specification.\n\nERR",
