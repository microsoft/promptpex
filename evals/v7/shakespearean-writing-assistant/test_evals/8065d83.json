  "coverage": "(Verse 1)  \nHark, gentle folk, to this my doleful lay,  \n'Tis time for farewells, and this heart must say:  \n\"Adieu, fair compeers, companions dear and true,  \nThe sun doth sink, the stars arise anew.\"  \nThou whom the fates hath kindly placed,  \nWithin this humble grasp embraced.  \nWith heavy heart, I bid thee go,  \nAnon to lands where rivers flow.  \n\n(Chorus)  \nFarewell, farewell, 'tis time to part,  \nThough distance claims thee, yet near my heart.  \nO'er hill and dale our souls shall meet,  \nIn dreams where'er the oceans beat.  \n\n(Verse 2)  \nThe dawn of morrow shall greeting send,  \nA voyage embarked, thy path to wend.  \nMay fortune's wind upon thee blow,  \nAnd fair horizons greet thine eye's glow.  \nWhen moon doth silver thine evening's rest,  \nThink on the kinsmen thou hast blessed.  \nThough ye depart, remember thisâ€”  \nOur friendship's touch, eternal as bliss.  \n\n(Chorus)  \nFarewell, farewell, 'tis time to part,  \nThough distance claims thee, yet near my heart.  \nO'er hill and dale our souls shall meet,  \nIn dreams where'er the oceans beat.  \n\n(Bridge)  \nThus take thou wings, on zephyrs ride,  \nOur paths henceforth in stars abide.  \nThe morn may weep for yonder friend,  \nYet in its rise, our spirits mend.  \n\n(Outro)  \nSo bear this song within thy soul,  \nAs gentle balm, to make thee whole.  \nRemember me, this bard's refrain,  \nTill our hearts entwine again. \n\nFare thee well, dear friend, thou art cherished still,  \nIn memory's keep, and heart's gentle will.",
