  "coverage": "**[A regal chamber in a castle. Moonlight filters through a grand window, casting shadows upon a lone figure clad in a rich robe. It is LADY AUDRINE, whose eyes flicker with the fire of desire. She paces with a measured grace, speaking to herself as the night envelops her.]**\n\n**LADY AUDRINE:**  \nO bright ambition, like the silv'ry stars  \nThat beckon 'yond the night's enfolding veil!  \nThou art the spark that lights the fire in men,  \nThe potent draught that doth erase all fear.  \n'Tis thou that heaves the heart to lofty dreams,  \nAnd breathes bold whispers into daring ears.  \nYet, gentle muse, thy visage hath two sides:  \nThou lifts one high to stand upon the peaks,  \nYet tempts the soul to fall for pride's own stake.  \n\nTo mine own chambers thou hast crept, unbid,  \nWith honey'd tongue hast thou my heart inspired  \nTo seek great deeds and wear a crown of gold.  \nMethinks that fate hath cast her glance on me,  \nTo pluck from sleeping destiny th'unseen thread.  \nOh, but should I ascend this arduous path,  \nWhat price thy guiding light demands from me?  \nCan righteous gain be forged from th'ambitious heart?\n\n**[Enter LORD REGINALD, her husband, with eyes aflame with his own desire. He approaches with an air of intrigue and stands by her side, looking into her eyes.]**\n\n**LORD REGINALD:**  \nMy Lady Audrine, where wand'rest thy fair thoughts?  \nDost dream of kingdoms ripe for noble hands,  \nThat seek to pluck their thrice-glorious crowns aloft?  \nShare with me, love, the visions thou dost weave.\n\n**LADY AUDRINE:**  \nReginald, thou hast pierced through my veils of thought.  \nAmbition's chalice rests within my grasp.  \nYet deep I muse upon the steps to take,  \nFor power's sweet allure doth beckon me.\n\n**LORD REGINALD:**  \nThen let us grasp this chance, dear heart, as one,  \nFor fortune favors those that dare to seize.  \nBy cloak of night and daylight's golden touch,  \nWe'll stride to meet our fates with steadfast hearts.  \n\nTogether, in ambition's name, we rise,  \nAnd claim the world that bends to our own will.  \nLet not a moment's doubt bedim thy gaze,  \nFor in thine eyes, the sun doth surely dwell.\n\n**LADY AUDRINE:**  \nThen come, my lord, let fate bear witness now,  \nTo this resolve that neither frays nor fades.  \nIn step united, towards the stars we tread,  \nTo crown ambition's fire within our souls.\n\n**[They clasp hands, gazing out toward the night, resolute and full of purpose. The shadows wane as the scene fades.]**\n\n**[Exeunt.]**",
