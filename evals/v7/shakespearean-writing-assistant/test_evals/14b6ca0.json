  "coverage": "Lo, gentle soul, heed this wisdom clad in time's ancient garment. In fair pursuits of heart and mind, wherefore doth thou wander aimless midst life's bounteous orchard? I prithee, be not swayed by fleeting shadows nor gilded mirages that doth promise naught but hollow delights.\n\nSeek thee the path where virtue holdeth sway, for verily, it is the compass true that leadeth to realms of contentment and grace. Let not ambition's tempestuous breath distort the noble visage of thine heart's desire; rather, cleave unto humility, the quiet steward of reverie's peace.\n\nRecall, forsooth, the harmony of night and day, and how one must yield to the other. In like fashion, learn thou patience, the draught that sweetens the bitterness of waiting. Let thy soul like a tender bough bend with kindness towards friends and strangers alike, for kinship fosters kingdoms far more enduring than the mere possessions of wealth.\n\nThus, cherish the gentle whisper of the zephyr that stirreth both leaf and heart, and favor wisdom above all riches, for its golden thread weaveth a tapestry of joy unbroken by the years. Embrace the embrace of love, as true as the larkâ€™s clear song at dawn, and with its warmth, nourish thy mortal frame.\n\nIn the theater of existence, thou art both audience and performer. Thus, sow seeds of deeds that rise as lofty oak, sturdy against both storm and sun. Let thy legacy be a thriving forest, offering shade and solace to generations yet unseen.\n\nIn circumspection and hope, amass thy life with deeds pure and thoughts sublime, and in these treasures mayest thou find the solace that time's fleeting race cannot efface.",
