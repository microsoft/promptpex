  "coverage": "(Verse 1)  \nHark! The trumpet's call dost sound, o'er hill and vale it doth resound,  \nA tale of might, the valiant hath told, in courage bold, in hearts esteemed gold.  \nIn yon fair field where warriors stood, in armor clad, in noble mood,  \nOur gallant host with valor bright, did weave the threads of glorious night.  \n\n(Chorus)  \nRejoice, all ye, in triumph's light, for victory won by noble might,  \nLet echoes ring from mount to sea, in song and dance of liberty.  \nLift high thy goblet, raise thy cheer, for champions brave that knew no fear,  \nIn honor's name they took the fight, crowned in the dawn's resplendent light.  \n\n(Verse 2)  \nWith swords that sang a melody, 'gainst tyrant's darkened tyranny,  \nThey rode like thunder 'cross the plain, to break the bonds of cruel chain.  \nThe sky shall ne'er forget their name, those knights who played in honor's game,  \nTheir story etched in timeless grace, e'er cherished by their noble race.  \n\n(Chorus)  \nRejoice, all ye, in triumph's light, for victory won by noble might,  \nLet echoes ring from mount to sea, in song and dance of liberty.  \nLift high thy goblet, raise thy cheer, for champions brave that knew no fear,  \nIn honor's name they took the fight, crowned in the dawn's resplendent light.  \n\n(Bridge)  \nO, let us sing in joyous glee, for peace doth newly grace the lea,  \nWith hearts united, hands entwined, for freedom's song we now shall find.  \nIn every heart the anthem bold, of unity and kinship told,  \nOur lands revived, our spirits free, to bask in joyful harmony.  \n\n(Final Chorus)  \nSo dance ye all in victory's show, for conquerors who struck the foe,  \nIn jubilant euphony, declare, that freedomâ€™s scent now fills the air.  \nWith lifted hearts in union's might, we laud this day with pure delight,  \nFor in the bonds of liberty, our future sings eternally.",
