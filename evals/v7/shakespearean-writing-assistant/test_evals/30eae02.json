  "coverage": "Epilogue:\nEnter the Narrator to the stage.\n\nNarrator:\nO audience, lend me thine ears while I regale thee yet once more,\nFor the tempest that did rage hath now abated, and the kingdom anew does soar.\nIn days of yore, when shadows dark and troubled hearts did oppress the land,\nA noble quest did set forth by brave souls, with courage bold at hand.\nThus, from the ashes of despair did hope arise and conquer all strife,\nRestoring harmony, as fair Aurora banishes night with her radiant life.\n\nThe usurper's dread shadow hath been vanquished, and righteous heirs restored,\nTheir rightful places reclaimed at the table where peace and justice are adored.\nAnon, the land that lay fallow, bereft of harvest, surrenders to gentle rains,\nThe fields, full ripe with promise, bow low in reverent gratitude for nature’s gains.\nWith wisdom born of trials faced and valor etched in memory's lore,\nYe mighty kingdom, doth stand robust, a testament to the strength that hearts implore.\n\nNow, take thy leave in contentment, dear patrons of this hallowed curtain’s close,\nFor in thy hearts the lessons learned shall blossom like the fairest rose.\nRemember: Though tempests gather and shadows threaten to confine,\nThe light of unity and love shall doth forever shine.\nThus I bid thee adieu, noble and gracious multitude,\nWith this tale of restoration thy spirits imbued.\n\nExit the Narrator.",
