Her trusted Advisor enters, bowing deeply.**\n\n**Queen Isabella:**  \nPrithee, speak, my noble sage of lore,  \nWhat news doth the whispering winds convey?  \nFor in thine eyes, such burden there dost rest,  \nAs if the heavens hath whispered to thee alone.\n\n**Advisor Reginald:**  \nYour Grace, fair beacon of this realm's thine light,  \nThe winds doth bear both gentle and grievous tale.  \nThe fields doth yield a golden bounty blessed,  \nYet in the shadows lurketh a tempest's ire.\n\n**Queen Isabella:**  \nAnon, unfold thy subtleties concealed,  \nWhat tempest wakes in yon horizon's clutch?  \nIs't treachery that stands upon my door,  \nOr nature's fury clad in shadowed guise?\n\n**Advisor Reginald:**  \nNeither betrayal's bane nor nature's wrath,  \nBut whispers of rebellion 'mongst the ranks.  \nThe common folk do grumble 'neath the strain,  \nOf taxes raised and burdens' heavy yoke.\n\n**Queen Isabella:**  \nWhat course, dear Reginald, wilt thou advise,  \nTo quell the embers 'fore they burgeon wild?  \nFor peace I seek, my scepter's gentle rule,  \nYet justice must attend its every stride.\n\n**Advisor Reginald:**  \nThy wisdom, Queen, hath ever shone so bright,  \nA council gathered, hear thy people's plight.  \nLet open ears and open hearts prevail,  \nIn temp'rate dialogue shall peace avail.\n\n**Queen Isabella:**  \nWise words, dear Reginald, thou art a light.  \nPrepare a discourse, let our kingdom’s soul  \nFind solace in a leader's gentle hand.  \nNow let us weave a future kind and just.\n\n**Advisor Reginald:**  \nAs thou commands, my Queen, so shall it be.  \nThe strength of Avalon, fast in thy grasp,  \nShall ever blossom 'neath thy noble reign,  \nWith wisdom’s grace and love’s enduring flame.\n\n**Queen Isabella:**  \nThen let us cast our troubles to the wind,  \nAnd face the morn with hope's eternal dream.  \nFor Avalon shall rise as bright as stars,  \nLed by the strength of loyal hearts and minds.\n\n**[Exeunt both, united in resolve and vision.]**",
