  "coverage": "Upon a field where silent shadows creep,  \nAmidst the mist where valiant spirits soar,  \nA warrior bold doth wake from fitful sleep,  \nHis heart resounding with a lion's roar.  \n\nO, bravest knight of virtuous renown,  \nThy visage gleaming 'neath the morning sun;  \nUpon this ground where ancient oaths are known,  \nThou fight'st to see thy noble quest begun.  \n\nWith armor fair, like polished silver bright,  \nHe rides upon a steed as black as night,  \nHis gaze as keen as falcon's piercing flight,  \nHis sword, a comet, cleaving through the light.  \n\nAnon the battle cries like thunder rise,  \nA tempest fierce that calls him to the fray;  \nYet in the chaos, 'tis his calm surmise,  \nThat gives him strength to face the coming day.  \n\nHe lifts his blade, and with a mighty cry,  \nDoth charge the foe with iron-willed embrace.  \nTo tumult's fiercest hum he dost defy  \nWith valor writ upon his stoic face.  \n\nFrom clash of steel to anguished cries that rend  \nThe very air with woe and grim lament,  \nOur hero fights until the day doth end,  \nAnd to his righteous cause his heart is lent.  \n\nUpon the bloody battlefield he stands,  \nA figure steadfast 'midst the ebbing tide,  \nWith honor bound by these, his warlike hands,  \nHe stands a champion, wither fate reside.  \n\nO, let the bards of yore sing forth his name,  \nOf noble deeds and valor's timeless flight,  \nFor he doth rise and claim his place in fame,  \nAnd shines, a beacon 'gainst the coming night.  \n\nThus ends the tale of one who dared to plight,  \nHimself to deeds that mortal hearts inspire;  \nA hero crowned with glory's golden light,  \nForever bathed in legends' sacred fire.
