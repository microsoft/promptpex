  "coverage": "Fair voyager, who doth tread upon the path of peril and adventure, may Fortune's gentle hands bestow upon thee her most bounteous favor. As thy bold foot doth begin its course to lands untold, where danger and discovery dance a wretched waltz, mayest thou find valor as thy stalwart guide.\n\nMay Aurora's first light illuminate thy way, and the whispered zeal of zephyrs nudge thee forth, swift and safe. Let the celestial sphere of stars above bear silent witness to thy trials and triumphs, as thou seeketh golden laurels amid shadowy groves.\n\nYea, should tempestuous seas or foul disquiet besiege thy heart, may the anchor of hope hold thee steadfast against adversity's tumult. May the fates weave for thee a tapestry of fortitude, that thy spirit be fortified 'gainst all manner of mischance.\n\nGo forth, noble wanderer, with the compass of thine own brave soul to steer thee true. Return with wondrous tales and treasures both gleaming and unseen, to warm the hearthstone of thine heart and kindle the flame of legend for those who wish to follow.\n\nAnd thus, fair traveler, our wishes bequeath thee: journey well, return safely, and let the world be richer for thy sojourn.",
