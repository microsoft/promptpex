  "coverage": "Oh, wondrous gentle soul, whose presence doth illuminate the shadowy corridors of mine heart! Thou art the silent star that guideth my weary bark ‘cross tempestuous seas. A tapestry unseen, thou art threaded into the fabric of mine deepest musings, a melody anon unheard yet ever whispered within the chambers of my yearning spirit.\n\n'Neath yon moonlit veil, I doth espouse mine devotion with veiled tongue, for love’s reverence oft requireth the guise of discretion. In this solemn vow, my thoughts doeth conceal themselves in the cloak of camaraderie, yet pulsate with echoes of unsaid ardor that beateth with every scorned breath. Thy visage is as a beauteous painting, gracing mine inward eye with colors celestial and sighs gentle afore the morn.\n\nMight I beseech the fates henceforth, that my silent vigil may unfold into gracious revelation? And that my spirit, unfettered, may lay its tribute at thy tender feet in joyous anon? Forsooth, though the heart may be a prisoner within its own gilded keep, it desireth naught but to bask in the radiant glow of thy presence, O rarest jewel among the alabaster seas.",
