  "coverage": "In the dim-lit chamber of mine heart, I doth lament with heavy sighs, for fair Aurora, sunlight of my soul, hath departed from mine arms. Each tender memory doth pierce my spirit with the sharpness of a thousand daggers, leaving me in a tempest of yearning thoughts.\n\nO, cruel fate! Thou art a remorseless thief, snatching hence the joyous company of mine dear heart's delight! In her absence, Time drags with leaden pace, and every tick doth mock mine longing.\n\nOft do I traverse the vale where sweet we once walked, whence the merry chorus of birds did echo our affection. Now, 'tis but a hollow scene, bereft of her silv'ry voice that did grace the air, like the gentle murmur of a brooke caressing its earthy bounds.\n\nMine tears do fall as rain upon a barren soil, full of yearning and empty of joy's rich seeds. Night, in her sable cloak, bringeth no solace, and slumber refuseth to woo mine weary eyes. Instead, I gaze upon yon distant stars, in the hope that perchance they dost carry my silent pleas to thee, my beloved.\n\nThou art a rose in a garden of pale thorns, whose vibrant charm captiveth mine soul and dost leave it bereft, e'er seeking reunion. O, that Fortune wouldst hear mine piteous cry, and reunite our sunder'd spirits, as two veering rivers converging anew.\n\nUntil that sweet day when destiny doth yield, I shall cling to thy dear image, treasured in the secret vaults of mine heart, and cherish every fleeting whisper of thy presence in the whispering breeze.",
