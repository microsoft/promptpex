  "coverage": "Lo, upon this night of wondrous gleam,  \nWhere harvest moon doth crown the fields with light,  \nWe gather 'round the table's bounteous theme,  \nTo revel in the earth's most golden might.  \n\n'Neath azure vault, adorned with starry hue,  \nThe orchards' yield rolled forth in ample share,  \nThe wine, it flow'd from goblets fair and true,  \nAs mirth and laughter danced upon the air.  \n\nThe merry band of souls with gladdened cheer,  \nIn lordly hall bedecked with autumn's gold,  \nDid pour to each their neighbor's ear and ear,  \nTales that in time of yore were bravely told.  \n\nThe maidens gaily forthwith garlands wove,  \nBright blossoms plucked from nature's rich embrace,  \nThey sang in voices sweet as cooing dove,  \nEach note a testament to harvest grace.  \n\nThe tables groaned with heaping draughts of corn,  \nOf honeyed pies and meats divinely made,  \nIn such abundance that the heart was torn,  \n'Tween gratitude and gluttony displayed.  \n\nUpon the morrow, when the dawn shalt break,  \nThe echo of this feast shall yet remain,  \nA memory that hearts are loath to forsake,  \n'Til harvest moon doth grace the sky again.  \n\nThus let the cups be raised, the spirits soar,  \nIn joy and fellowship, we mark this tide,  \nFor such a feast is boon forevermore,  \nRejoice in nature's gifts, and ne'er divide.
