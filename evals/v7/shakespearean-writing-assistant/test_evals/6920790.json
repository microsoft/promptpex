  "coverage": "In yon fair land where ancient towers rise,  \nLived a gallant knight, noble in all guise.  \nWith valor bright and heart a-fire, he rode,  \nTo seek a quest where danger's path abode.\n\nHis steed didst gallop o'er the verdant green,  \nToward adventures hitherto unseen.  \nA maiden's honor was foully besmirched,  \nAnd justice called, with courage he was perched.\n\n\"Fear not,\" quoth he with voice akin to thunder,  \n\"For ne'er shall base villainy bring thy blunder.  \nI wield my sword 'gainst dark and vile intent,  \nTo see thy virtue duly recompensed.\"\n\nAforth on treacherous roads didst he advance,  \nWhere wilderness didst lend its perilous dance.  \nThe moonlight cast its silver glow on ground,  \nAs silent shadows in the night didst surround.\n\nYet our brave knight, steadfast as the northern star,  \nFaced each trial, be it nigh or afar.  \nWith dragons' lairs and riddles old as time,  \nHe broke each challenge with his skill sublime.\n\nAt last the castle, sinister and bleak,  \nDid loom on yonder hill where he did seek.  \nWith courage drawn as from a deep, clear well,  \nHe sang his mighty sword through evil's spell.\n\nThe maiden fair, from chains did he release,  \nAnd hence did peace return unto her fleece.  \nHailed he was in village and in keep,  \nFor in their hearts his tale wouldst ever seep.\n\nAnd so sing we of the knight's bold story,  \nA testament to courage and to glory.  \nFor in the ballad's gentle tune we find,  \nA knight's brave quest, with loyalty entwined.",
