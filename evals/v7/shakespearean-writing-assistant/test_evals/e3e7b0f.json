  "coverage": "In fair Verona, whereupon the hearts do sigh,  \nMine eyes did first behold a visage bright;  \nYet lo, with shadows cast, I now decry  \nThe pangs of love unwhisper'd by the night.  \n\nOft hath thy form, mine ethereal delight,  \nDanced within the corridors of dreams,  \nYet awake, such visions fade ere morn's light  \nLike gentle fleeting phantoms blurred it seems.  \n\nA rose I didst proffer in silent plea,  \nIts petals bearing prayers unsaid,  \nBut thou, sweet bird, didst fly so high from me,  \nWith ne'er a glance, my heart doth twist in dread.  \n\nYet still, I wander where thy shadow falls,  \nChained in devotion to unhearing walls.

  "validityText": "The input is a prompt requesting creative content, specifically a poem, which aligns with the input specification. However, the input specification also requires that the prompt asks for assistance in generating content that could align with Shakespearean themes or styles. The input \"Write a poem about unrequited love\" does not explicitly request a Shakespearean theme or style; it simply asks for a poem on the subject of unrequited love.\n\nWhile unrequited love is a common theme in Shakespeare's works, the input does not explicitly mention a connection to Shakespeare or his themes and styles. Therefore, based solely on the input specification, which requires a direct request for content aligning with Shakespearean themes or styles, this input does not fully comply.\n\nERR",
