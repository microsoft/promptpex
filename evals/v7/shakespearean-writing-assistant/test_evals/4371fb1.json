  "coverage": "Oh fair celestial muse, draw nigh and lend thy grace,\nAs I, a humble heart, beneath the heavens trace.\nYon gleaming orbs dost light the canopy of night,\nAnd in their twinkling ways, inspire my soul's delight.\n\nAttend thine eyes, sweet love, unto the starlit sky,\nWhere 'midst the vast expanse, such beauties softly lie.\nYet even they do pale when set against thy glow,\nFor thou art more sublime than all the stars dost show.\n\nThy breath, a gentle breeze, dost stir the sable air,\nEnchanting all the world with whisper’d prayer.\nAnd when my gaze doth meet thine own, so tender bright,\nThe universe stands still in sheer celestial might.\n\nThou art the beacon o'er the midnight's silent shade,\nA gleam of destiny in softly woven jade.\nThus, by the gods above, my heart’s full passion sounds,\nIn verses fond and true, where love eternal bounds.\n\nOh, give thy heart to mine, and let our souls entwine,\nAs stars dance on the waves, in cosmic love divine.\nFor in thine arms, I find a solace ever sweet,\nA lover's joy and peace whene'er our spirits meet.\n\nSo, with night's veil about, and stars a-watchful keep,\nI vow to thee, mine own, in fervent love so deep.\nBeneath yon starry dome, our pledge shall ne'er expire,\nFor thou—mine only love—art all my heart's desire.",
