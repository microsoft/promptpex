  "coverage": "O radiant Luna, fair queen of the night,  \nThou dost cast thy silv'ry beams 'pon the earth,  \nIn shadow'd realms where the dark takes its flight,  \nTo witness the dawn of celestial birth.  \n\nThy visage serene, with beauty untold,  \nDost paint the night's canvas with argent hue,  \nWhile stars doth twinkle like diamonds of old,  \nTo mimic the grace that abideth in you.  \n\nO mirror of dreams, thy secrets unfold,  \nMysteries spun from time's eternal loom,  \nThy gentle embrace, both tender and bold,  \nDoth banish the dark and tenderly bloom.  \n\nMethinks the world sleeps in thy soothing gaze,  \nAs poets and lovers sing songs in thy praise.",
