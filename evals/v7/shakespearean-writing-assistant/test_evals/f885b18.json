  "coverage": "Ah, fair enquirer, though thou asketh for a tale without the trappings of dramatics, yet I shall strive to weave thee a tapestry rich in words and gentle elegance.\n\nIn yon kitchen, where the morn's light splays its golden fingers o'er humble hearth and cupboard, thou begin'st thy quest to conjure the humble brew. First, take thee a teapot, noble vessel of warmth and comfort, and let it welcome the kiss of water, fresh from the stream or well.\n\nSet thy kettle upon the stove’s fiery embrace, and with bated breath, await the dance of steam, announcing thus the water’s eager readiness. Meanwhile, retrieve from thy larder the leaves of Camellia sinensis, ensconced within a caddy of fine countenance.\n\nOnce the kettle doth sing its clarion call, pour forth the boiling brew into the teapot where the leaves art lain, thus inviting their fragrant essence to unfurl and entwine with the bubbling liquid. Cover the pot with its lid, a crown upon the regal head, and let it sit in contemplation that the flavors may meld in harmonious union.\n\nWhen time, that gentle thief, hath count’d to four, pour the tea into a chalice of thy choosing, a cup or mug, as suits thy fancy. Consider adding milk’s creamy softness or honey’s golden nectar if thy heart desires. Partake of your creation, embracing in thy hands this cup of warmth, ensconced within the gentle sighs of peace and comfort.\n\nThus, thou hast fashioned a cup of tea, simple, yet profound in its quiet majesty.",
