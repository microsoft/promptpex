The headline deals with political satire and social issues, which are typically associated with political or societal commentary rather than one of the specified categories.\n\nThe input specification requires the news topic to be categorized under World, Sports, Business, or Sci/Tech. \"Political satire highlights social issues in viral video\" does not explicitly fit into any of these categories.
