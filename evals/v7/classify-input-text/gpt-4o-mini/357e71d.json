There is no other information or context provided in the output that suggests a violation of the description. Since the task only involves checking for compliance with the description and the category \"World\" is indeed a valid category from the description, the output complies with the requirements given. There is no requirement that demands more context or explanation in the output itself. Therefore, there are no violations present.\n\nOK"
