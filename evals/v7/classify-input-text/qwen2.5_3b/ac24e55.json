The description specifies that the task is to classify a given news article into one of the categories: World, Sports, Business, or Sci/Tech. The output does provide a classification under the category Business, but it also includes a detailed explanation about cybersecurity and business trends, which goes beyond simply assigning a category. The task description does not specify that such an explanation is necessary or expected. Therefore, the additional explanation is not aligned with the description, leading to non-compliance.\n\nERR"
