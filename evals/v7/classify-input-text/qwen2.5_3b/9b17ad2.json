This is in line with the description's requirement to classify a given text into a specific category (World, Sports, Business, Sci/Tech). \n\nNo part of the description requires evaluating whether the classification or justification is accurate without the input text. Therefore, based on the guidelines provided and the fact that the output adheres to the requirement of classifying the text into one of the specified categories, there is no violation in the chatbot's output.\n\nOK"
