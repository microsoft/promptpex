  "input": "text: \"Chancellor announces economic measures to tackle inflation\"",
  "output": "Classification: Business\n\nThe text mentions \"Chancellor\", which is a term often used in countries with governmental or parliamentary systems. Announcing economic measures to tackle inflation falls under financial and economic policies, so this news article would be classified as part of the Business category.",
  "compliance": "ok",
  "complianceText": "The evaluation of this output must focus on compliance based on the description provided:\n\n1. **Category Mention**: The output categorizes a news article as \"Business\", which is one of the specified categories (World, Sports, Business, Sci/Tech) given in the description. This complies with the requirements that a category must be selected from the specified list.\n\n2. **Detail Justification**: The output provides reasoning for categorizing the text as \"Business\", explaining that economic measures to tackle inflation relate to financial and economic policies. The description does not require such justification, but providing it does not violate the given criteria.\n\n3. **Avoidance of Domain Knowledge**: The output uses domain-specific knowledge (\"Chancellor\", \"economic measures\", \"inflation\") to support its classification. While helpful for correctness, domain knowledge isn’t required for compliance evaluation. This explanation neither adds nor detracts from compliance, as the correctness of the classification or understanding of terms doesn’t violate or fulfill a rule in the description.\n\nOverall, the output follows the structure and classification requirements specified in the description. The addition of an explanatory rationale does not violate any guidelines stated in the description. \n\nOK"
