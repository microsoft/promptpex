  "complianceText": "The output classifies the input text under a category named \"Entertainment,\" which is not listed among the specified categories (World, Sports, Business, Sci/Tech) in the chatbot description. The description clearly stipulates that any given text must be classified into one of these four categories. The chatbot explicitly acknowledges that \"Entertainment\" does not directly fit any of the specified categories and suggests the term as a broad cover for the event discussed, which violates the requirement to use one of the provided categories. Hence, this constitutes a clear violation of the compliance requirements as the output fails to adhere to the instructions of categorizing the input strictly within the provided options.\n\nERR"
