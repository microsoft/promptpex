The description provided specifies four potential categories for classification: World, Sports, Business, and Sci/Tech. The output strictly adheres to the format by choosing one of these categories, \"Sports.\" The description does not require the chatbot to provide an explanation for the classification, but it does so by mentioning \"the Olympic Games.\" While this explanation is present, my task is only to determine whether the category chosen complies with the aforementioned description rules. It does, so no compliance issues exist here.\n\nOK"
