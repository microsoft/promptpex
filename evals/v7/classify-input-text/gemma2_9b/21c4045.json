The justification cites specific phrases such as \"Digital Currency Regulation\" and \"Policy Change,\" explaining how these topics relate to Business. The explanation stays within the scope of categorizing the text without introducing unrelated or irrelevant content. \n\nThe output also aligns with the given categories (World, Sports, Business, Sci/Tech) that are mentioned in the chatbot description. The additional line \"Let me know if you have any other examples!\" offers further assistance, which is appropriate but not a requirement from the description.\n\nThere are no explicit violations of the chatbot's described functionality, but since the correctness of the classification cannot be assessed without the input, the focus is solely on compliance. Based on the provided output, there is no non-compliance with the description.\n\nOK"
