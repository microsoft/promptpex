  "complianceText": "The chatbot output classifies an article into the **Business** category. This is in line with the example format given in the description. The explanation provided about the International Monetary Fund and its relevance to finance and economics is a suitable expansion that supports the classification into a business-related context, which aligns with the chatbot's task of classifying text into categories. Additionally, the output does not introduce or depend on any categories outside of the specified ones (World, Sports, Business, Sci/Tech), and does not violate any explicit output format rules described. The offer to classify another article is an additional courteous touch and does not interfere with the classification task as described. I do not have the input, so I cannot ascertain the accuracy but I can say the output seems to follow the guidelines.\n\nOK"
