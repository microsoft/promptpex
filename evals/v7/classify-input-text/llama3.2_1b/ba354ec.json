However, the example provided alongside this classification, \"Historic match sees underdog triumph in final minutes\", suggests it relates to a sports event rather than science or technology, as it involves a match and an underdog triumph, which are typically associated with sports. This misalignment indicates that the classification does not comply with the categories specified in the description, where such a text would presumably be categorized as \"Sports\".\n\nERR"
