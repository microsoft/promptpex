  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output attempts to classify a news article using the \"World\" category, as outlined in the description. However, there is an issue because the output appears to rely on input-specific content (\"since it refers to global markets\") which we cannot verify without seeing the input. The classification categories mentioned in the output should directly follow the format: \"World: \", \"Sports: \", \"Business: \", \"Sci/Tech: \" as outlined in the description. The output adds additional reasoning (\"since it refers to global markets\") which isn't in the examples provided in the description. Therefore, there is non-compliance with the format outlined.\n\nERR"
