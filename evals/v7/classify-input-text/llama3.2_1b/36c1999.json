  "complianceText": "The output provided by the chatbot violates several aspects of the description:\n\n1. **Classification according to the description**: The list provided in the output mentions \"World or Sci/Tech\" and \"Business or Sports\", which deviates from the description. According to the description, each category is distinct, and an example belongs to a single category only.\n\n2. **Misclassification of examples**: The examples given in the output are incorrectly associated with categories. For instance, it groups \"UN chief urges action on climate change as report warns of 'catastrophe'\" with both World and Sci/Tech, and \"Apple delays plan to scan iPhones for child abuse images\" with both Business and Sports, which contradicts the provided description.\n\n3. **Failure to classify**: The chat output states that it cannot classify the text because it's a breaking news statement. However, the description does not mention breaking news as an exception to categorization. Thus, it deviates from the task of classifying a news article into one of the specified categories.\n\nDue to these violations, the output does not comply with the chatbot description.\n\nERR"
