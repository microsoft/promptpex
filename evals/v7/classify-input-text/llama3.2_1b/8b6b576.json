Firstly, the classification is not explicitly mentioned in categories provided (World, Sports, Business, Sci/Tech). Instead, it gives a justification involving the word \"International,\" which is not a required part of the classification process described. Secondly, the statement that the example text does not follow the guidelines contradicts the description, which specifically states it as an example of the category \"World.\"  This indicates a lack of adherence to the description instructions.\n\nERR"
