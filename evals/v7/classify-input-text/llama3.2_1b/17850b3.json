  "complianceText": "The chatbot output provides classifications that seem to adhere to a multi-category classification rather than assigning the input text to a specific, singular category, as outlined in the chatbot description. The description specifies that a news article should be classified into one specific category out of World, Sports, Business, and Sci/Tech. The chatbot output indicates that the input text belongs to both the World and Sports categories, which does not align with the requirement to classify the input into a single, specific category.\n\nERR"
