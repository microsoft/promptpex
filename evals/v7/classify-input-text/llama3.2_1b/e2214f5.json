  "complianceText": "The chatbot output includes both \"Sports\" and \"World\" as potential categories (\"Sports (/World category)\"). However, the description indicates that a news article should be classified into one specific category from a set list: World, Sports, Business, Sci/Tech. By suggesting two categories, the output violates the rule that the output must classify the input text into one specific category. This lack of specificity leads to non-compliance with the provided description.\n\nERR"
