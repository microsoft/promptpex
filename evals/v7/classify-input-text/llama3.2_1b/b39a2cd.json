The chatbot is expected to classify the input text into one of four categories: World, Sports, Business, or Sci/Tech. The output should reference these categories explicitly.\n\n2. While the output does specify a category, it incorrectly states \"Sport\" instead of the correct category \"Sports\" as provided in the examples within the description. Deviating from the specified category names indicates non-compliance.\n\nTherefore, there is a violation due to the incorrect categorization terminology used, as it does not match what is explicitly stated in the description.\n\nERR"
