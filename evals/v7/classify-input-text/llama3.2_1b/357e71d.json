While celebrity relationships and breakups can be widely newsworthy, the specific detail of it being a \"celebrity couple\" makes World more relevant than Sports, Business, or Sci/Tech.",

  "complianceText": "The output provided by the chatbot does not comply with the description. The description specifies four possible categories for classifying a news article: World, Sports, Business, and Sci/Tech. The example for the \"World\" category is related to global issues like climate change, not celebrity news. The output incorrectly categorizes an article about a \"celebrity couple's breakup\" into the \"World\" category, which does not align with the example scenarios given for any of the prescribed categories, as celebrity news wasn't identified as fitting within those categories. This signifies a misalignment with the guidelines provided in the description.\n\nERR"
