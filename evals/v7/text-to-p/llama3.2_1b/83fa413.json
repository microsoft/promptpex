  "complianceText": "The description states that the text should be split into individual sentences and each sentence should be wrapped with a `<p>` tag, with the requirement of having at least three `<p>` tags in total. The provided output has only two `<p>` tags, which does not meet the minimum requirement of three. \n\nFurthermore, the output uses `<strong>` and `<em>` tags in a manner that disrupts the flow of the text and overlaps across multiple sentences, which makes it difficult to ascertain if every sentence contains both a `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize key words and phrases. The nesting of `<em>` tags within other text elements also appears incorrect as per how typical HTML nesting is expected (like `<em>a <em>wonderful</em></em>`).\n\nThe primary issue leading to non-compliance is the insufficient number of `<p>` tags and an unclear application of `<strong>` and `<em>` tags.\n\nERR"
