However, in the given output, not every sentence is wrapped individually with a `<p>` tag; there is a sentence on a line: `<strong>Automation</strong> increases efficiency.` which is not enclosed within a `<p>` tag. Additionally, in each `<p>` tag, there should be one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags, but this is not consistently applied across the output. For instance, the first paragraph has neither a `<strong>` nor an `<em>` tag within the `<p>` tags, and similarly, the second and third paragraphs are lacking the specified tags inside them.\n\nERR"
