  "complianceText": "The output does not comply with the description for the following reasons:\n\n1. The chatbot description requires that the paragraph be split into individual sentences and each sentence should be wrapped with a <p> tag. The text contains five <p> tags, and the last <p> tag is empty, which implies it may not represent a sentence.\n\n2. According to the description, inside each <p> tag, there should be one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags to emphasize key words and phrases. The output lacks <strong> and <em> tags entirely, missing a critical requirement.\n\nBased on these observations, the chatbot output violates the description. Therefore, the output is non-compliant.\n\nERR"
