  "complianceText": "The chatbot description requires that each sentence within a paragraph should be enclosed within a `<p>` tag and each `<p>` tag should include one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags. The output contains three `<p>` tags, satisfying the description's requirement of having at least three `<p>` tags.\n\nHowever, upon examining the `<p>` tags, each tag contains a `<strong>` tag as required, but there are no `<em>` tags present in any of the `<p>` tags to emphasize key words and phrases, which is a requirement in the description. This omission constitutes a clear violation of the given description since it explicitly states the inclusion of multiple `<em>` tags within each `<p>`.\n\nERR"
