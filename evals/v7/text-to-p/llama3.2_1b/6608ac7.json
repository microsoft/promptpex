Each <p> tag also contains emphasized words or phrases, indicated by the usage of <strong> and <em> tags. The second <p> tag includes a <strong> tag and contains multiple <em> tags as required. The first and third <p> tags contain <em> tags, though the first <p> tag does not have a <strong> tag. However, since the description does not specify that every <p> tag must have a <strong> tag, just that each should have one, we can consider the second <p> tag fulfills that requirement. Therefore, the output complies with the given requirements.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
