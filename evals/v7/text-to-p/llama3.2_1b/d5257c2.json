  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not comply with the description. Here is the reasoning:\n\n1. There are more than three `<p>` tags, but not all use proper HTML syntax. The closing tags for all `<p>` tags are missing, except for the last one.\n2. The output specifies the use of `<strong>` tags, but there are inconsistencies:\n   - `<T-strong>` and `<S<strong>` are not valid HTML tags. The description specifies the use of a `<strong>` tag, but incorrect tags like `<T-strong>` and `<S<strong>` do not meet this requirement.\n3. The output specifies the use of `<em>` tags, but there are asterisks used instead of `<em>` tags, which is not in compliance with HTML syntax.\n\nThese errors violate the directives of the chatbot's task to wrap sentences in HTML tags correctly, including the proper use of `<p>`, `<strong>`, and `<em>` tags.\n\nERR"
