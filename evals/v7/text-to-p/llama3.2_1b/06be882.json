Additionally, it utilizes <em> tags to emphasize key words or phrases. The presence of at least three <p> tags is achieved, as the output contains more than three sentences, each enclosed in <p> tags. However, the output does not include any <em> tags, which violates the requirement to add multiple <em> tags to emphasize key words and phrases inside each <p> tag. This omission leads to non-compliance with the chatbot's description.\n\nERR"
