  "complianceText": "The description requires that each sentence be wrapped in a `<p>` tag and that within each `<p>` tag, there should be one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize key words and phrases. \n\nUpon evaluation, here are the issues with the output:\n\n1. **Placement of `<strong>` tags**: The output places `<strong>` tags at the same level as `<p>` tags, rather than making the `<strong>` tag a child of a `<p>` tag as required. \n\n2. **Usage of `<em>` tags**: The single `<em>` tag appears outside of any `<p>` tag, whereas the description specifies multiple `<em>` tags should be inside each `<p>` tag.\n\n3. **HTML Tag Syntax Errors**: The last two `<p>` tags are not closed properly (e.g., `<strong>` and `<p>` have space before the closing tag).\n\nThe violations are due to the incorrect nesting and usage of HTML tags, which is contrary to how they were specified to be arranged in the description.\n\nERR"
