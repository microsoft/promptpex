In the provided output:\n\n1. The first <p> tag is empty, which suggests either an error or misplaced <p> tags.\n2. None of the actual content-containing <p> tags include any <strong> or <em> tags to emphasize key words or phrases.\n\nThe absence of <strong> and <em> tags within each of the three main <p> tags constitutes a clear deviation from the specification.
