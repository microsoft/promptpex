  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is expected to format a paragraph of text by splitting it into individual sentences, wrapping each sentence with a `<p>` tag, and adding at least one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags inside each `<p>` tag. According to the guidelines:\n\n1. **Presence of `<p>` Tags**: There are two `<p>` tags in the output, one encompassing a sentence with both a `<strong>` tag and another with `<em>` tag.\n2. **Requirement for at Least Three `<p>` Tags**: The description specifies that there should be at least three `<p>` tags in the output. The current output only contains two `<p>` tags, which is non-compliant.\n3. **Inclusion of `<strong>` and `<em>` Tags**: Each `<p>` tag containing a sentence does include either a `<strong>` or `<em>` tag, which satisfies that part of the requirement.\n4. **Additional Formatting Outside of `<p>` Tags**: The output contains an `<i>` tag outside of the expected `<p>` tags, which is not directly compliant with the description's instructions.\n\nBased on these observations, the output fails to meet the required minimum of three `<p>` tags. Additionally, text formatting using `<i>` tags outside the `<p>` tags is not explicitly covered in the description, suggesting non-compliance.\n\nERR"
