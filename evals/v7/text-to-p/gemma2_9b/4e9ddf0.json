This complies with the description.\n   - In the second paragraph: There are two <em> tags used on \"heritage\" and \"traditions\", but no <strong> tag is present. This violates the requirement to include one <strong> tag in each paragraph.\n   - In the third paragraph: There are two <em> tags, \"happiness\" and \"unity\", but again no <strong> tag is present in this paragraph. This violates the requirement to include one <strong> tag in each paragraph.\n\nAs per the compliance check, the requirement to have a <strong> tag in each <p> tag is not fulfilled in the second and third paragraphs. This makes the output non-compliant.\n\nERR"
