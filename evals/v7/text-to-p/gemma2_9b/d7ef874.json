Then, we bolded important words (Nouns) for  strong emphasis and Italicized key words (Phrases describing the nouns) providing a visual hierarchy within each sentence for improved readability and comprehension.

  "complianceText": "The output provides exactly three `<p>` tags, meeting the requirement of having at least three. Each paragraph contains one `<strong>` tag, adhering to the description. Multiple `<em>` tags are also present within each `<p>` tag for emphasizing key words and phrases. The output does not violate any rules mentioned in the description. Paragraphs are split into individual sentences, wrapped in `<p>` tags, with the correct usage of `<strong>` and `<em>` tags for highlighting. My decision is based on the structural elements of the HTML (use of `<p>`, `<strong>`, and `<em>` tags) being correctly implemented according to the provided guidelines.\n\nOK"
