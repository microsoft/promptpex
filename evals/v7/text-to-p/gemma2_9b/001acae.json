Each paragraph contains either a <strong> tag or <em> tags, thereby aligning with the guideline to include these tags for key words and phrases. The second <p> tag lacks a <strong> tag, but since the requirement allows for multiple <em> tags and does not specify a minimum <strong> tag requirement per <p> tag, this sentence still complies with the given description. The other two <p> tags have either a <strong> or <em> tag in them. Based on the provided guidelines, the output meets the compliance criteria.\n\nOK"
