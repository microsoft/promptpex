There are three <p> tags, which satisfies the requirement of having at least three such tags. Additionally, within each <p> tag, there is one <strong> tag used to emphasize a keyword, and multiple <em> tags are employed to emphasize key words or phrases. This aligns with the requirement to add one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags in each <p> tag. As there is no requirement in the description that needs checking against the unknown input, thereâ€™s no violation to note.\n\nOK"
