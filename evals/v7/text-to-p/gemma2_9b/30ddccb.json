The output shows three distinct sentences, each encapsulated in its own `<p>` tag.\n\n2. **Minimum Sentence Requirement**: The output contains exactly three `<p>` tags, meeting the minimum requirement of at least three specified in the description.\n\n3. **Use of <strong> and <em> tags**: Within each `<p>` tag, there is at least one `<strong>` tag and at least one `<em>` tag to emphasize keywords, complying with the requirement to add these tags inside each `<p>` tag. Each sentence contains a single `<strong>` tag and at least one `<em>` tag.\n\nGiven that the output adheres strictly to the description by splitting the text into individual sentences, using at least three `<p>` tags, and including the requisite `<strong>` and `<em>` tags within each `<p>` tag, the output complies with the chatbotâ€™s intended function of formatting a paragraph as specified.\n\nOK"
