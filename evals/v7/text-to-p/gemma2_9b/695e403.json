The output contains three `<p>` tags, each containing a single sentence. This satisfies the description's requirement for having at least three `<p>` tags.\n3. Each `<p>` tag includes a `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags, which aligns with the requirement to emphasize key words and phrases inside each sentence.\n\nTherefore, the chatbot output complies with the description provided. \n\nOK"
