There is no mention in the description that the emphasis placement or levels need to be dynamic or alterable by the chatbot itself, so the statement about experimenting with different emphasis levels is irrelevant to the compliance decision. Therefore, based on the given description and the output provided, there is no violation of the compliance requirements.\n\nOK"
