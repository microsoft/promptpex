There should be at least three `<p>` tags in the output.\n\nUpon examining the chatbot's output:\n\n- The output contains three `<p>` tags, which meets the minimum requirement of three `<p>` tags.\n- Each `<p>` tag contains one `<strong>` tag, which complies with the requirement for at least one `<strong>` tag per `<p>`.\n- However, each `<p>` tag contains only one `<em>` tag, which does not comply with the requirement for multiple `<em>` tags per `<p>` tag.\n\nThe violation is the lack of multiple `<em>` tags within each `<p>` tag, as specified in the description. Therefore, the output does not fully comply with the requirements.\n\nERR"
