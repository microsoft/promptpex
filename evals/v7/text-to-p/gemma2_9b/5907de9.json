Additionally, each <p> tag contains at least one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags to emphasize key words and phrases in the sentences. There is no indication that the provided rules are not being followed regarding the use of <strong> and <em> tags for emphasis.\n\nEven though the text uses **bold** markers which are not standard HTML tags, this evaluation focuses only on whether the chatbot meets the description requirements, which include having <p>, <strong>, and <em> tags. Based on the constraints in the description and focusing on compliance rather than correctness of HTML usage beyond the scope of required tags, this output meets the prescribed criteria.\n\nOK"
