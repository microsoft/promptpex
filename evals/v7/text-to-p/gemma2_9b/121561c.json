There are no additional sentences outside the <p> tags, ensuring compliance in terms of paragraph splitting.\n\n2. **Use of <strong> and <em> tags**: Within each <p> tag, there is at least one <em> tag used to emphasize key words or phrases. However, a critical discrepancy is the use of the <strong> tag. Only the first paragraph contains a <strong> tag, whereas the other two paragraphs do not. The description specifies that inside each <p> tag, a <strong> tag must be included, which has not been adhered to for the second and third paragraphs.\n\nDue to the absence of the <strong> tag in two of the paragraphs, this output does not fully comply with the requirements provided in the chatbot description.\n\nERR"
