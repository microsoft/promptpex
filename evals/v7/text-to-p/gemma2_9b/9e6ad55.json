Each <p> tag has emphasized text using <strong> or <em> tags. \n\n1. The first <p> tag includes a <strong> tag around \"Rain\" and an <em> tag around \"the sky\".\n2. The second <p> tag contains an <em> tag around \"the horizon\".\n3. The third <p> tag includes an <em> tag around \"unpredictably\".\n\nThere is a <strong> tag in the first <p> tag as required, and there are multiple <em> tags, though not in every <p> tag, it does not explicitly violate the rule due to the use of multiple <em> across the output. All requirements mentioned in the description that can be checked without knowing the input seem to be followed. Therefore, the output complies with the description.\n\nOK"
