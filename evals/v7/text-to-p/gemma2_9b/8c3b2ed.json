The output has three `<p>` tags, which is consistent with the requirement of having at least three `<p>` tags.\n2. Each `<p>` tag must contain one `<strong>` tag. The first `<p>` tag contains a `<strong>` tag around \"Poetry,\" the second `<p>` tag contains a `<strong>` tag around \"Poets,\" and the third `<p>` tag is missing a `<strong>` tag, hence does not comply with this requirement.\n3. Each `<p>` tag should also contain multiple `<em>` tags. However, the output uses HTML syntax for bold (**) which is incorrect, as the description specifies the use of `<em>` tags, not any other format or syntax for emphasis.\n  \nFrom these checks, there's a failure in the requirement of having at least one `<strong>` tag in every `<p>` tag and the use of `<em>` tags instead of the correct format. Therefore, there are violations in the output.\n\nERR"
