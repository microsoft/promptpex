The first `<p>` tag contains a `<strong>` tag emphasizing the word \"Reading\" and two `<em>` tags emphasizing \"books\" and \"knowledge\", which follows the instruction to use one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags within each sentence.\n\n2. The second `<p>` tag has a `<strong>` tag emphasizing \"improves\" and `<em>` tags for \"vocabulary\" and \"comprehension skills.\"\n\n3. The third `<p>` tag has a `<strong>` tag around \"People,\" and although it intends to emphasize text with asterisks around \"understand,\" it should have used a `<strong>` tag as required. It also contains `<em>` tags for \"read regularly\" and \"complex topics.\"\n\nThe third sentence improperly uses asterisks for emphasis instead of an HTML `<strong>` tag, which breaches the requirement to use a `<strong>` tag. This discrepancy leads to non-compliance with the description provided.\n\nERR"
