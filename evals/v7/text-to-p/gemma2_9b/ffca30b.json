Each `<p>` tag also contains a `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags, complying with another part of the description. \n\nHowever, I noticed that the `<em>` tags are malformed in the output - they are written as `<em\">` rather than `<em>`. This is a violation of proper HTML tagging and does not align with the description which requires valid HTML tags to be used. The presence of malformed tags makes it non-compliant with the requirement to properly wrap key words with `<em>` tags.\n\nBecause the tags are not correctly formed, the output does not comply with the chatbot description.\n\nERR"
