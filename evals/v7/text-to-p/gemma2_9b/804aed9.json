This complies with the requirement of having at least three `<p>` tags.\n\n2. **Use of `<strong>` and `<em>` Tags**: Each `<p>` tag contains one `<strong>` tag, which complies with the requirement. Additionally, all but one sentence in the output use `<em>` tags to emphasize key words/phrases. However, in the second sentence, the phrases are emphasized using underscores instead of `<em>` tags. This violates the guideline that requires the use of `<em>` tags for emphasizing text.\n\nDue to the improper use of underscores in place of `<em>` tags in the second sentence, the output does not fully comply with the description provided.\n\nERR"
