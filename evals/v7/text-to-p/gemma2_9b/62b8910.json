  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output has several issues with compliance based on its description. Here's the evaluation:\n\n1. **Each Sentence Wrapped in a `<p>` Tag**: The output duplicates the three sentences, resulting in six `<p>` tags around the three distinct sentences. The output should have only included each sentence once with its corresponding `<p>` tag.\n   \n2. **Inclusion of `<strong>` Tag**: Each sentence includes exactly one `<strong>` tag, which complies with the requirement.\n   \n3. **Inclusion of `<em>` Tags**: Each sentence has `<em>` tags, fulfilling the requirement to \"emphasize key words and phrases.\" However, the word \"precision\" in the second sentence is not wrapped in an `<em>` tag, should have been wrapped in an `<em>` tag instead of underscores.\n\nThese issues indicate a partial compliance; however, due to duplication of sentences and incorrect use of underscores instead of `<em>` tag, it does not fully comply with the description.\n\nERR"
