In this output, there are a total of six `<p>` tags, but they consist of repetitions. Each `<p>` tag does contain one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags, which complies with the guideline per tag.\n\nThe evaluation should not focus on correctness regarding duplication or content, but strictly on compliance with formatting as per the description. Therefore, although there are repeated paragraphs, it is compliant because more than three `<p>` tags are present, and each fulfills the requirement to contain one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
