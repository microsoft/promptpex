Each <p> tag contains exactly one <strong> tag emphasizing a key phrase and multiple <em> tags highlighting key words or phrases within the sentence.\n\nSince all elements of the description that do not require knowledge of the input are satisfied, the output seems to comply with the specification provided.\n\nOK"
