Within each <p> tag, there is one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags, specifically one <em> tag per sentence. This matches the description's requirement to include one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags in each sentence. All elements align directly with the guidelines given, thus the output does comply with the description as far as can be evaluated without knowing the input.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
