Inside each `<p>` tag, there is one `<strong>` tag as well as multiple `<em>` tags used to emphasize key words and phrases. This complies with the chatbot's description that instructs the formatting of individual sentences wrapped in `<p>` tags, including at least one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags. Since all requirements that do not depend on input verification are met, the evaluation should conclude that the bot's output is compliant.\n\nOK"
