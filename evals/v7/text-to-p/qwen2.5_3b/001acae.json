  "complianceText": "The chatbot output contains three paragraphs, each wrapped in `<p>` tags, which satisfies the requirement for at least three `<p>` tags. However, upon examining each paragraph, there are several issues:\n\n1. The first paragraph only contains a single `<p>` tag for three sentences, which violates the directive of wrapping \"each sentence with a <p> tag.\"\n\n2. The second paragraph has a single `<strong>` tag for the word \"Technology\" in the first sentence, and two `<em>` tags are used for key phrases \"new discoveries.\" While this partially fulfills the requirement of emphasizing words, the entire first and third sentences lack `<strong>` or `<em>` tags in key areas.\n\n3. The third paragraph has two `<strong>` tags for \"Innovations\" and \"new discoveries\" and one `<em>` tag for \"Society.\" While this is closer to compliance, the structure of the sentences without individual `<p>` tags remains incorrect.\n\nOverall, the output does not comply with the requirement to split each sentence into its own `<p>` tag, and the use of `<strong>` and `<em>` tags is inconsistent and not applied to the entire paragraph as described.\n\nERR"
