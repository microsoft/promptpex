According to the description, the task is to split the paragraph into individual sentences and wrap each sentence with a `<p>` tag. Each `<p>` tag should contain at least one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags for emphasizing key words and phrases. Additionally, there should be at least three `<p>` tags in total.\n\nIn the provided output:\n\n1. There are only two `<p>` tags present. \n2. Some sentences from the first output inside `<p>` tags are combined into one `<strong>` element instead of separate `<p>` elements for each sentence. \n3. The description mentions that each sentence should be wrapped in a `<p>` tag, but this isn't followed in the second output as it combines sentences within a single `<p>`.\n\nSince there should be at least three `<p>` tags, and the requirement for wrapping each sentence with a `<p>` tag has not been fulfilled, the output violates the guidelines mentioned in the description.\n\nERR"
