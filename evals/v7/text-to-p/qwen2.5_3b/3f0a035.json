  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not meet the compliance requirements specified in the description. The description clearly states that the paragraph should be split into individual sentences, where each sentence should be enclosed in a separate `<p>` tag. The output provided wraps multiple sentences onto a single `<p>` tag instead, which is a violation. Furthermore, even though the output mentions wrapping sentences with `<strong>` and `<em>` tags, it does not comply with the guideline of having each sentence in its own distinct `<p>` tag.\n\nBecause of these reasons — particularly the failure to wrap each of the individual sentences in their own `<p>` tags and not producing at least three `<p>` tags — the output does not comply with the specified requirements.\n\nERR"
