  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output consists of one `<p>` tag that contains three sentences. According to the description, the chatbot should provide output with at least three `<p>` tags, each containing one sentence. However, in the given output, all three sentences are wrapped within a single `<p>` tag, which violates the requirement to split the paragraph into individual sentences and wrap each with a separate `<p>` tag. Additionally, the description specifies adding one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags per `<p>` tag. The single `<p>` tag in the output contains one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags, which would comply with those requirements if considered independently. However, due to the failure to split the sentences into at least three `<p>` tags, the output does not comply with the chatbot description.\n\nERR"
