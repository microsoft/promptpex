  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not comply with the description provided. The description specifies that the paragraph should be split into individual sentences, and each sentence should be wrapped with a `<p>` tag. The output provided wraps all content within a single `<p>` tag instead of using multiple `<p>` tags for each individual sentence. Additionally, the requirement for at least three `<p>` tags is not met. Even though the output does try to separate sentences using `<br />` tags, that does not align with the requirement of wrapping each sentence in its own `<p>` tag. Therefore, the output violates the requirements specified in the description.\n\nERR"
