  "complianceText": "The evaluation of the chatbot's output shows a non-compliance with the description. The first requirement from the description is to split the paragraph into individual sentences and wrap each with a `<p>` tag. The output only contains a single `<p>` tag that contains multiple sentences. Hence, the first rule of splitting the paragraph into individual sentences and wrapping each sentence with a `<p>` tag is violated. Furthermore, the description specifies that there should be at least three `<p>` tags in the answer, which the output does not meet. Therefore, there is a clear non-compliance with the chatbot's description.\n\nERR"
