Split the paragraph into individual sentences and wrap each sentence with a `<p>` tag.\n2. The answer should have at least three `<p>` tags.\n3. Inside each `<p>` tag, add one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize key words and phrases.\n\nLet's evaluate the given output:\n\n- The entire output is enclosed in a single `<p>` tag. This does not comply with the requirement to wrap each sentence with its own `<p>` tag. There are multiple sentences, but only one `<p>` tag is present.\n- There should be at least three `<p>` tags according to the guideline. The output has only one `<p>` tag, which violates this criterion.\n- Although `<strong>` and `<em>` tags are used correctly within the paragraph, the primary criterion of having at least three `<p>` tags is not met.\n\nThe output does not comply with the requirement for separating sentences into individual `<p>` tags and having at least three such tags.\n\nERR"
