Each `<p>` tag includes one `<strong>` tag, adhering to the rule of adding one `<strong>` tag per sentence. The third `<p>` tag contains an `<em>` tag as well, emphasizing part of the sentence, which is consistent with the guideline of using multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize key words and phrases. Although not every sentence has `<em>` tags, the rule allows for multiple `<em>` tags, not necessarily that each sentence must contain them. Thus, the output has no clear violations of the chatbot's description.\n\nOK"
