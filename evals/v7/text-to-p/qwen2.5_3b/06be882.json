However, there are no `<em>` tags included to emphasize key words and phrases within the sentences. The description clearly specifies that each `<p>` tag should contain one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags, but the chatbot's output only includes the `<strong>` tags. This omission is a direct violation of the requirement to use multiple `<em>` tags inside each sentence.\n\nERR"
