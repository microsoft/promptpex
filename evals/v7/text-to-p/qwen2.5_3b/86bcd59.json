  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not comply with the description provided. \n\nFirstly, the description specifies that the answer should have at least three `<p>` tags. However, the output only contains two `<p>` tags. This violates the guideline that requires splitting the paragraph into individual sentences and wrapping each sentence with a `<p>` tag, especially the stipulation on having a minimum number of `<p>` tags in the output. \n\nAdditionally, the description mentions adding one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags inside each `<p>` tag to emphasize key words and phrases. While the use of `<strong>` and `<em>` tags is present, the basic requirement of three `<p>` tags has not been met, which is sufficient for non-compliance.\n\nERR"
