Inside each `<p>` tag, there is a `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags, which also complies with the requirement to include one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize key words and phrases.\n\nHowever, there is a clear violation in the structure of the HTML tags. The third `<p>` tag contains an incorrect closing tag: `</rangle>` instead of `</em>` for the emphasize tag. This is a mistake in the HTML syntax, which violates the requirement to properly format the paragraph as HTML, as it leads to invalid HTML.\n\nTherefore, due to the incorrect closing tag in the third `<p>`, the output does not comply with the requirement for proper HTML formatting.\n\nERR"
