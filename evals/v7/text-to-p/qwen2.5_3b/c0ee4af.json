  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is supposed to format a paragraph of text as HTML by splitting the paragraph into individual sentences and wrapping each sentence with a <p> tag. \n\n1. **Number of <p> Tags**: The description specifies that there should be at least three <p> tags in the output, and the given output includes three <p> tags, which complies with the description.\n\n2. **<strong> Tag**: Each sentence should include one <strong> tag. In the provided output, the first two sentences include a <strong> tag, but the third sentence does not. This violates the guideline requiring one <strong> tag per sentence. \n\n3. **<em> Tags**: Each sentence should contain multiple <em> tags to emphasize key words and phrases. The second sentence includes two <em> tags, and the third sentence includes two <em> tags as well. The first sentence, however, does not contain any <em> tags.\n\nThe noncompliance lies in the absence of a <strong> tag in the third sentence and the absence of <em> tags in the first sentence. Thus, the output does not fully comply with the guidelines described.\n\nERR"
