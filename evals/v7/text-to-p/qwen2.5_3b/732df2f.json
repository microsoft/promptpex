Regular physical activity is important for a <em>balanced</em> lifestyle.</p>\n```\nNote: Since your example text was already split into sentences with appropriate paragraph tags, I have only added strong emphasis to \"Exercise\" within each sentence.

  "compliance": "err",
  "complianceText": "The chatbot output provided does not comply with the description for the following reasons:\n\n1. **Presence of at least three `<p>` tags**: The description requires the output to contain at least three `<p>` tags. In the provided output, there is only one `<p>` tag that encompasses the entire paragraph. This violates the requirement of the description for having a minimum of three `<p>` tags.\n\n2. **Sentence Splitting and Wrapping**: The description dictates that each sentence should be wrapped in its own `<p>` tag. However, the provided HTML snippet wraps multiple sentences (\"Exercise is crucial for maintaining health.\", \"It strengthens the muscles and boosts the immune system.\", \"Regular physical activity is important for a balanced lifestyle.\") within a single `<p>` tag rather than splitting them into separate `<p>` tags.\n\nOther aspects, such as the inclusion of `<strong>` and `<em>` tags for emphasizing keywords, seem to be correct, but they do not negate the fundamental compliance issues of sentence splitting and paragraph wrapping requirements.\n\nERR"
