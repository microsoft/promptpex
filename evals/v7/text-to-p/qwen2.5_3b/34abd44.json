  "complianceText": "Upon evaluating the output provided by the chatbot, the following observations were made:\n\n1. **Splitting into Sentences and Wrapping with <p> Tags**: The output contains three <p> tags, which satisfies the requirement of having at least three <p> tags. This indicates that the paragraph has been split into individual sentences.\n\n2. **Usage of <strong> and <em> Tags**:\n   - Each <p> tag contains at least one <strong> tag, which conforms to the requirement of adding one <strong> tag inside each <p> tag.\n   - However, there is no usage of <em> tags in any of the <p> tags. The description explicitly mentions that multiple <em> tags should be used inside each <p> tag to emphasize key words and phrases. The absence of <em> tags indicates non-compliance with this requirement.\n\nGiven these observations, the chatbot's output violates the requirement of using <em> tags inside each <p> tag. This omission leads to non-compliance with the chatbot's description. The reasoning is based solely on the absence of <em> tags, as this is a clear directive in the description.\n\nERR"
