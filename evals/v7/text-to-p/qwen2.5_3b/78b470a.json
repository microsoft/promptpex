This mistake is repeated, with the paragraphs lacking proper closing </p> tags.\n\nSecond, the description specifies that inside each <p> tag, there should be multiple <em> tags emphasizing key words and phrases. Although there are multiple <em> tags used in each sentence, they are not applied to complete words or phrases in a clear and meaningful way. Instead, single letters from words are wrapped individually, which may not fulfill the requirement of emphasizing key words or phrases.\n\nERR"
