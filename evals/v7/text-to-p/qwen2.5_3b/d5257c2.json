  "complianceText": "The chatbot output provides two `<p>` tags, but the description explicitly requires that the output should have at least three `<p>` tags. In both of the provided `<p>` tags, there is one `<strong>` tag within each, which follows the requirement of having a `<strong>` tag in each `<p>` tag. Additionally, each `<p>` tag contains multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize key words and phrases, which also adheres to the chatbot's description. However, the primary violation here is the lack of the required minimum of three `<p>` tags.\n\nERR"
