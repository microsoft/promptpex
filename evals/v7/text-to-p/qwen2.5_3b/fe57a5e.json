Although the text might have more potential for multiple <em> tags, the description does not specify a minimum number of <em> tags, just that there should be multiple across the entire output. In each <p> tag, several words are emphasized with <strong> and <em> tags which satisfies the requirement.\n\nThere is no explicit rule violation observed in the output based on the provided description. All the required elements with <p>, <strong>, and <em> tags are present in sufficient quantity and usage.\n\nOK"
