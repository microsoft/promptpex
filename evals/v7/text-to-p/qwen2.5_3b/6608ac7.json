  "complianceText": "The chatbot output contains three <p> tags, which satisfies the rule that states \"Your answer should have at least three <p> tags\", as there are exactly three <p> tags present. Each <p> tag contains sentences that are enclosed within <strong> and <em> tags, indicating an attempt to emphasize key words and phrases within each sentence. Therefore, the structure of wrapping and emphasizing with tags also complies with the description. Since there is no explicit information about checking the uniqueness or correctness of sentences themselves without knowing the input, and since these structural elements are adhered to, the requirements are met. \n\nOK"
