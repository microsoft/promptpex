  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output includes three sentences, each wrapped in a <p> tag, which satisfies the requirement of having at least three <p> tags. Each sentence also contains a <strong> tag as required. However, the description specifies that each <p> tag should contain multiple <em> tags to emphasize key words and phrases. In this output, none of the sentences contain an <em> tag, which violates this requirement. Additionally, I noticed that in the first paragraph the closing </p> tag is incomplete, which is another violation of the expected output format as per HTML standards.\n\nERR"
