  "complianceText": "The given chatbot output is required to have each sentence wrapped with a `<p>` tag, with at least three such tags present. Additionally, each `<p>` tag must contain one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize keywords and phrases.\n\n- Looking at the provided output, there are three `<p>` tags, which complies with the guideline of having at least three `<p>` tags.\n- Within each `<p>` tag, there is indeed at least one `<strong>` tag, which also complies with the requirement.\n- The `<em>` tags are present in all the paragraphs, so that condition is met as well.\n\nHowever, there are issues with the HTML structure:\n1. Paragraph one includes `<em>` and `<i>` tags that are not properly closed or consistently opened, such as `<strong>o</i>v</em>e</i>r`, `<strong>l</i>a</em>zey`.\n2. Similarly in the third sentence `<strong>D</strong>ogs <em>b</em>a<em>r</em>k <em>at</em> <em>stran</i>ger</i>s.</p>`, there are issues such as `<i>` closing tags without matching open tags or `<em>` tags being closed with `</i>`.\n3. Moreover, invalid formatting can lead to ambiguous emphasis application, which contradicts proper HTML tag usage.\n\nThese structural issues cause the chatbot's output to be non-compliant as it results in incorrect HTML formatting, which is directly against what the description instructs regarding formatting the sentences with HTML tags.\n\nERR"
