  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is supposed to split the paragraph into individual sentences and wrap each sentence with a <p> tag. Each <p> tag should have at least one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags to emphasize key words and phrases. The output must have at least three <p> tags.\n\nUpon reviewing the output:\n1. The output contains three <p> tags, which complies with the requirement of having at least three <p> tags.\n2. In the first <p> tag, there is a <strong> tag, and there are multiple <em> tags used to emphasize key words and phrases. This complies with the guideline.\n3. However, in the second and third <p> tags, there is only a <strong> tag each, and no <em> tags are included. This violates the requirement that there must be multiple <em> tags inside each <p> tag.\n\nBased on the aforementioned analysis, the output does not fully comply with the chatbot description as multiple <em> tags are required in every <p> tag.\n\nERR"
