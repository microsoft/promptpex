  "validityText": "The given input is a paragraph consisting of three sentences: \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\", \"Cats sleep all day.\", and \"Dogs bark at strangers.\". This satisfies the requirement of the input specification that states the paragraph must be long enough to contain at least three sentences. The input does not explicitly mention or use HTML tags for emphasis, but the specification does not state that emphasis is mandatory; it only allows for the possibility of using <strong> and <em> tags. Therefore, the lack of emphasis tags does not constitute a violation of the specification.\n\nOK",
