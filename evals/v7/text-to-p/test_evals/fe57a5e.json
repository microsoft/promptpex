There are no <strong> or <em> tags used for emphasis. Additionally, it is debated if the paragraph is \"long enough\" since it contains exactly three sentences, which is the minimum required, but not explicitly stated as compliant because there's no HTML formatting evident. Based on rule 1, I must conclude there's a violation. \n\nERR",
