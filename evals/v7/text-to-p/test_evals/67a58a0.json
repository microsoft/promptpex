  "validityText": "The input consists of three sentences, each expressing a distinct idea about different types of creatures. This adheres to the requirement that the paragraph must contain at least three sentences. The input contains simple statements and does not inherently include the use of HTML tags for strong or emphasized text.\n\nThe specification allows, but does not mandate, the inclusion of emphasized text using <strong> and <em> tags. Therefore, the absence of <strong> or <em> tags does not necessarily lead to non-compliance as these are optional according to the input specification. \n\nThus, the input complies with the input specification, as it is a paragraph of text with at least three sentences.\n\nOK",
