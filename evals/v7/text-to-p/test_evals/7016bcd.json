  "validityText": "The input provided is \"Time passes. Memories fade. New opportunities arise.\" \n\n- Upon examining the input specification, it states that the input must be a paragraph of text. The input does appear to be a paragraph because it forms a coherent passage with consecutive sentences.\n- The specification also requires that the paragraph must contain at least three sentences. In the given input, there are three distinct sentences: (1) Time passes. (2) Memories fade. (3) New opportunities arise. This requirement is thus satisfied.\n- Another specification is that the paragraph can include words or phrases that can be emphasized using <strong> and <em> tags. The specification uses the word \"can\", indicating that the inclusion of such tags is optional, not mandatory. Therefore, the absence of emphasized words or phrases does not violate the specification.\n\nConsidering all these points, the input fulfills all requirements: it is a paragraph containing at least three sentences, and the optional requirement of emphasis using HTML tags does not lead to non-compliance.\n\nOK",
