  "validityText": "Upon examining the input, it consists of three sentences: \"The universe is vast,\" \"Stars are numerous,\" and \"Galaxies span light-years.\" These sentences form a paragraph, thus meeting the criterion of containing at least three sentences. However, while the input meets the minimal requirement of three sentences, it does not include any words or phrases that are emphasized using <strong> or <em> tags. This additional element was specified as a possibility but not a necessity, therefore the absence of such emphasis does not constitute a violation, according to the input specification that mentions \"can include\" rather than \"must include.\"\n\nOK",
