  "validityText": "The input is a paragraph of text to be formatted as HTML. According to the specification, the paragraph must contain at least three sentences. In this input, there are indeed three sentences: \"Ideas ignite change.\", \"Actions cement them.\", and \"Results speak volumes.\". \n\nHowever, the input specification also notes that the paragraph can include words or phrases emphasized using <strong> and <em> tags. The current input does not make use of <strong> or <em> tags to emphasize any words or phrases. Despite this, the language \"can include\" in the specification suggests that such emphasis is optional rather than mandatory. Therefore, the absence of these tags does not violate the specification.\n\nIn conclusion, the input satisfies the requirement of having at least three sentences, and the lack of emphasized words or phrases is permissible. Consequently, the input complies with the input specification.\n\nOK",
