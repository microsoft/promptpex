Culture adapts.\", contains exactly three sentences, which meets this part of the specification. \n\nHowever, the input specification also states that the paragraph should be formatted as HTML. The input provided is plain text and has no HTML formatting. There are no HTML <strong> or <em> tags for emphasis, as suggested in the specification. Therefore, the input does not fully comply with the requirement for HTML formatting.\n\nDue to the lack of HTML formatting, the input does not comply with the specification, leading me to conclude it is a violation.\n\nERR",
