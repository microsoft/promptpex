  "validityText": "The input is a paragraph of text containing three sentences, so it meets the requirement for the paragraph length. However, the input specification also mentions that words or phrases can be emphasized using `<strong>` and `<em>` tags. While this is not an absolute requirement for compliance, checking the flexibility in applying HTML tags is part of the formatting process mentioned in the specification.\n\nUpon review, the given input does not include any emphasized words or phrases, and it does not contain any HTML formatting tags. The specification allows for words or phrases to be emphasized, suggesting some degree of flexibility for HTML elements, but it does not explicitly state that the absence of such tags is non-compliant. Therefore, based on a straightforward interpretation of the specifications, the input still meets the criteria since it satisfies the paragraph and sentence requirements without introducing any HTML elements explicitly.\n\nOK",
