The specification also mentions that words or phrases can be emphasized using <strong> and <em> tags, but it doesn't require them for compliance. Therefore, the absence of <strong> and <em> tags does not represent a violation. Thus, based on the specification, the input meets the requirement of being a paragraph with at least three sentences.\n\nOK",
