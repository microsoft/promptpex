  "validityText": "The input is a paragraph of text, which appears to be formatted as plain sentences. Let's evaluate the input against the specification:\n\n1. **Paragraph Requirement**: The input is presented as a series of sentences. It appears to be a paragraph, as it consists of three distinct sentences.\n\n2. **Sentence Count Requirement**: The specification requires that the paragraph contain at least three sentences. The input contains exactly three sentences: \"Technology simplifies tasks.\" \"Automation increases efficiency.\" \"Growth follows innovation.\" This satisfies the sentence count requirement.\n\n3. **HTML Formatting Requirement**: The specification indicates that the paragraph needs to be formatted as HTML. As the examples in the problem statement suggest, HTML formatting would usually mean including HTML tags (such as `<p>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`, etc.) in the text. The input provided does not contain any HTML tags, which means it is not formatted as HTML.\n\n4. **Emphasis Requirement**: The specification mentions that certain words or phrases can be emphasized using `<strong>` and `<em>` tags. While this is an optional aspect (indicated by \"can be\"), the complete lack of any HTML tags constitutes a failure to comply with the formatting requirement.\n\nGiven the analysis, the input fails the HTML formatting specification, as it does not include any HTML tags at all, violating the requirement that the paragraph needs to be formatted as HTML.\n\nERR",
