  "validityText": "The input consists of a paragraph that needs to be formatted as HTML. I will evaluate it based on the following input specification rules:\n\n1. **Length Requirement**: The paragraph must contain at least three sentences. The input provided contains the following sentences:\n   - \"The world of science offers endless possibilities.\"\n   - \"Scientists work tirelessly to make breakthroughs.\"\n   - \"Their discoveries have improved the quality of life.\"\n   This means that there are three sentences in the input, fulfilling the minimum length requirement as per the specification.\n\n2. **Structural Requirement**: The input should be continuous with logical sequencing, which it is. It's coherent and logically structured.\n\n3. **HTML Formatting Requirement**: The specification suggests using HTML tags such as `<strong>` and `<em>` for emphasizing words or phrases, but it does not make it a mandatory requirement. The input does not contain any such emphasis, which does not violate the specification, as it remains optional.\n\nGiven these points, the input complies with the input specification since it contains more than three sentences and does not violate any other explicit requirements outlined.\n\nOK",
