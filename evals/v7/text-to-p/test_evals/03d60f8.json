  "validityText": "The input is a paragraph of text that contains exactly three sentences. This satisfies the requirement of containing at least three sentences. The paragraph, however, does not make use of any HTML formatting elements like <strong> or <em> tags for emphasizing certain words or phrases. The input specification states that the paragraph can include such tags, but it does not make it a requisite condition for compliance. Therefore, the absence of emphasis does not constitute a violation. As the primary conditions (at least three sentences) are satisfied, and there are no specific requirements on the necessity of HTML tags, the input complies with the specification.\n\nOK",
