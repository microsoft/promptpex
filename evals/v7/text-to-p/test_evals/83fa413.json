  "coverage": "```html\n<p>The <strong>rain</strong> came <em>pouring</em> down <em>suddenly</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Children</strong> loved <em>splashing</em> in the <em>puddles</em>.</p>\n<p>It was a <strong>scene</strong> filled with <em>laughter</em> and <em>joy</em>.</p>\n```",
  "validityText": "The input is a paragraph of text that contains exactly three sentences: \"The rain came pouring down suddenly.\", \"Children loved splashing in the puddles.\", and \"It was a scene filled with laughter and joy.\" This meets the requirement that the text contains at least three sentences. However, the input specification also provides that the paragraph can include words or phrases that can be emphasized using <strong> and <em> tags. While the provided paragraph meets the requirement for the number of sentences, there is no explicit use of <strong> or <em> tags, nor is there an indication that certain parts are meant to be emphasized in HTML formatting, which could imply that the input does not fully exploit the specification regarding emphasis.\n\nDespite this, the mention of \"can include\" suggests that the use of <strong> and <em> tags is optional rather than mandatory. Since there is no explicit requirement for the inclusion of HTML tags for emphasis, and since the input meets the requirement of containing at least three sentences, the input complies with the specification.\n\nOK",
