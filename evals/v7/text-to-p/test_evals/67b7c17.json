In this input, there are three sentences: \"The sky is blue.\", \"Grass is green.\", and \"Sunsets are stunning.\" This satisfies the first part of the specification. However, the specification also mentions that the paragraph can include words or phrases that can be emphasized using <strong> and <em> tags, although this is not a strict requirement. Hence, the absence of <strong> or <em> tags does not constitute non-compliance. Therefore, the input complies with the input specification.\n\nOK",
