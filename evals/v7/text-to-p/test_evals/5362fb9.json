However, the input does not include any words or phrases that are formatted with `<strong>` or `<em>` tags for emphasis. The input specification mentions that the paragraph \"can include words or phrases\" that are emphasized, which implies that including `<strong>` or `<em>` tags is optional. Therefore, based on the given specification, the input is compliant as it satisfies the condition of having at least three sentences, and does not violate any requirement with the absence of emphasized tags since they are not mandatory.\n\nOK",
