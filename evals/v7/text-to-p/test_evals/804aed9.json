  "validityText": "The input given to me for evaluation is a paragraph consisting of three short sentences: \"Mountains stand tall. Valleys remain low. Rivers flow endlessly.\" Let's assess this against the input specifications provided:\n\n1. **Three Sentences Minimum**: The specification requires that the paragraph must be long enough to contain at least three sentences. The input contains exactly three sentences: \"Mountains stand tall.\", \"Valleys remain low.\", and \"Rivers flow endlessly.\", so this criterion is met.\n\n2. **HTML Formatting Requirement**: Although the paragraph must be formatted as HTML, the specification doesn't explicitly require that the input itself be in HTML format. The specification suggests that words or phrases can be emphasized with `<strong>` and `<em>` tags, but it doesn't mandate that such tags must be used in every instance.\n\n3. **Content and Emphasis**: There are no `<strong>` or `<em>` tags in the input to emphasize any content. However, since the specification only mentions that these tags \"can\" be used, it doesn't obligate their inclusion, thus the absence of these tags doesn't constitute a violation.\n\nTherefore, the input adheres to the provided specifications regarding sentence count (at least three sentences) and doesn't violate any specific requirement concerning HTML formatting or usage of emphasis tags since those are optional.\n\nOK",
  "validity": "ok"
