  "validityText": "The provided input is a paragraph of text. According to the input specification, the paragraph must adhere to the following criteria: 1) It should be formatted as HTML; 2) it must contain at least three sentences; 3) it may include words or phrases emphasized using <strong> and <em> tags.\n\nUpon evaluating the given input:\n\n1. **HTML Formatting Compliance**: The input is simply plain text and not formatted as HTML. There are no HTML tags present, such as <p>, <strong>, or <em>, which would typically be involved in properly formatted HTML text. \n\n2. **Sentence Count**: The input paragraph does satisfy the second requirement as it contains three distinct sentences:\n   - \"Libraries are treasure troves of knowledge.\"\n   - \"They house books from diverse genres.\"\n   - \"Many people find solace in the quiet corners of a library.\"\n\n3. **Use of <strong> and <em> Tags**: The input also allows for the optional use of <strong> and <em> tags. While their use is not mandatory according to the specification, since they are allowable, it's crucial to note that they were not used in the input. However, lack of use does not imply a violation in this context.\n\nThe major point of non-compliance stems from the requirement that the text must be formatted as HTML. The input is only plain text. Based on the identified violation relating to the lack of HTML formatting, the input does not comply with the input specification.\n\nERR",
