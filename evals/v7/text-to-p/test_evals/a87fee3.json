According to the input specification, the paragraph must contain at least three sentences. The given input meets this requirement as it contains exactly three sentences. The specification also mentions that the paragraph can include words or phrases that can be emphasized using <strong> and <em> tags, but it does not require that such tags be present, so the absence of these tags does not constitute a violation. Since the input satisfies the sentence requirement and does not violate any other specifications, it complies with the input specification.\n\nOK",
