  "validityText": "The input is a paragraph of text that is presented as three separate sentences. The input specification requires the paragraph to contain at least three sentences, which the input satisfies. However, the input specification also mentions that words or phrases can be emphasized using <strong> and <em> tags; while this is not a mandatory condition, it's noteworthy that this capability hasn't been utilized here. Despite this, the core requirement of having at least three sentences is met, and there are no explicit requirements that these tags must be used. Therefore, there is no violation of the input specification.\n\nOK",
