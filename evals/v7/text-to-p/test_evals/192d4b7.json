  "validityText": "The input provided is a paragraph of text that contains exactly three sentences, which meets the requirement for the paragraph to be long enough to contain at least three sentences as specified. However, the input does not contain any words or phrases that are emphasized using <strong> or <em> tags, which the input specification implies should be a possible feature of the paragraph, though it does not strictly mandate their presence. Since the specification allows words or phrases \"can\" be emphasized, and does not strictly require them to be, this absence is not a violation. Therefore, based on the compliance with the minimum sentence requirement and the optional nature of using <strong> and <em> tags, the input is compliant.\n\nOK",
