  "validityText": "The input is a paragraph of text with sentences. Let's evaluate it against the input specification:\n\n1. **Three Sentences**: The input contains three sentences: \"Technology advances rapidly.\", \"Innovations lead to new discoveries.\", and \"Society adapts slowly.\". This satisfies the requirement of having at least three sentences in the paragraph.\n\n2. **HTML Formatting**: The input should be formatted as HTML. However, the input provided does not include any HTML formatting. It is simply plain text without any HTML tags.\n\n3. **Use of <strong> and <em> tags**: The specification allows the use of <strong> and <em> tags for emphasizing words or phrases. The input does not include any such tags, but their inclusion is not explicitly required. The specification only mentions that they \"can be\" included, which implies that their absence does not constitute non-compliance.\n\nThe primary issue is that the text is not formatted as HTML, as required by the input specification. It fails to comply with the requirement to be in HTML format, which would involve encapsulating the paragraph within HTML tags.\n\nERR",
