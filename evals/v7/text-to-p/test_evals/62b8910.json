  "coverage": "```html\n<p><strong>Cooking</strong> is an <em>art</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Baking</strong> requires <em>precision</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Grilling</strong> <em>enhances</em> <em>flavors</em>.</p>\n```",
  "validityText": "The first step in my evaluation is to check if the paragraph contains at least three sentences. The input \"Cooking is an art. Baking requires precision. Grilling enhances flavors.\" is composed of three distinct sentences, fulfilling the sentence requirement.\n\nNext, I need to determine if the paragraph includes words or phrases that could benefit from emphasis using <strong> and <em> tags. The input does not explicitly mention any words being emphasized, but the input specification does not demand the presence of emphasized words or phrasesâ€”only that they \"can include\" them. Therefore, this part of the specification provides an optional requirement rather than a mandatory one.\n\nFinally, the paragraph should be formatted as HTML. While the input is plain text, the specification only states that it \"needs to be formatted as HTML\" without specifying any exact formatting requirements beyond the possible use of <strong> and <em> tags. There are no such tags in the input, but since the specification doesn't insist on their presence unless emphasis is needed, the input can still be considered valid.\n\nGiven the above evaluation, the input adheres to the following rules:\n1. It contains at least three sentences.\n2. Though no emphasis tags are included, the specification does not require them unless needed.\n3. The phraseology and knowledge-based capability allow potential HTML formatting.\n\nTherefore, the input complies with the input specification.\n\nOK",
