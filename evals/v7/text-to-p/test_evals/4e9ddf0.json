  "validityText": "The input provided is a paragraph of text containing three sentences: \n\n1. \"Festivals bring communities together in joy.\"\n2. \"They celebrate heritage and traditions.\"\n3. \"Such gatherings spread happiness and foster unity.\"\n\nAccording to the input specification, the paragraph must contain at least three sentences, which this input does.\n\nHowever, the input specification also states that the paragraph can include words or phrases that can be emphasized using <strong> and <em> tags. It does not state that this is a mandatory requirement; therefore, the absence of such tags does not lead to non-compliance with the input specification.\n\nBased on my evaluation, since the paragraph meets the requirement of containing at least three sentences and the inclusion of HTML tags is optional, the input complies with the input specification.\n\nOK",
