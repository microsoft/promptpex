  "coverage": "```html\n<p>Cities are <strong>crowded</strong>. <em>Urban life</em> is complex and offers a variety of opportunities. The hustle and bustle <em>never seem</em> to slow down.</p>\n<p>Villages are <strong>serene</strong>. <em>Life</em> in a village is often peaceful and <em>close</em> to nature. Tradition and simplicity <em>define</em> many such places.</p>\n<p>Beaches are <strong>relaxing</strong>. The <em>soothing sound</em> of waves and the <em>gentle sea breeze</em> create a perfect environment to unwind. Many people enjoy their <em>tranquility</em>.</p>\n```",
  "validityText": "The input contains three sentences: \"Cities are crowded.\", \"Villages are serene.\", and \"Beaches are relaxing.\" Each of these sentences is short but valid. However, the input specification requires the paragraph to include at least three sentences, which it does. The input does not have emphasized words using <strong> and <em> tags, but the input specification states the paragraph \"can include\" these tags - it's not mandatory to include them. Therefore, this absence is not a violation. The input must meet the criteria of at least three sentences, which it does, and there is no requirement for HTML tags or any specific word count other than the three sentences minimum.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",
