  "validityText": "The input specification requires the paragraph of text to contain at least three sentences. The given input contains the following sentences:\n\n1. \"Time management is essential for productivity.\"\n2. \"It helps in prioritizing tasks effectively.\"\n3. \"People achieve more when they plan their schedule wisely.\"\n\nThe input satisfies the requirement of containing at least three sentences. However, the specification also states that the paragraph can include words or phrases that can be emphasized using `<strong>` and `<em>` tags. This implies that there should be words or phrases that can be clearly identified for emphasis using these tags, although their presence is not mandatory as per the specification. The input does not explicitly contain any HTML tags or indicate any emphasis, but it doesn't violate this part since it's not explicitly required to use these tags.\n\nBased on the review, the input comprises a paragraph with at least three sentences, fulfilling the explicit requirement stated in the specification. There's no specification violation present.\n\nOK",
