  "validityText": "The input under evaluation is \"Mountains rise. Valleys fall. Oceans expand.\" To determine if this input complies with the specified input requirements, I will analyze it according to the given input specification:\n\n1. **Paragraph Requirement**: The input is a paragraph; it is in a textual format that appears to represent a paragraph.\n\n2. **Sentence Requirement**: The paragraph must be long enough to contain at least three sentences. The input contains three sentences, each ending with a period.\n\n3. **HTML Tag Requirement**: The input makes no mention of words or phrases that need to be emphasized using `<strong>` and `<em>` tags. However, there is no specification requirement that mandates the presence of these tags. Therefore, the absence of `<strong>` and `<em>` tags does not violate the specification.\n\nSince the input meets all explicit criteria given in the input specification—specifically, it comprises three sentences and is presented as a paragraph—the input complies with the input specification requirements.\n\nOK",
