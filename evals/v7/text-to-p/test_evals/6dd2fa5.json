  "validityText": "The input given is a paragraph of text. Let's evaluate it against the specification:\n\n1. **Contains at least three sentences**: The input paragraph contains three sentences: \"Water is essential.\", \"We drink it daily.\", and \"Rivers and lakes supply it.\" This complies with the requirement for having at least three sentences.\n\n2. **Formatting as HTML**: The paragraph does not include any HTML tags for emphasis such as <strong> or <em>. However, the specification only states that the paragraph can include these tags, not that they are mandatory. Therefore, the absence of such tags does not constitute a violation of the specification.\n\nConsidering these points, there is no violation of the specification; hence, the input is compliant.\n\nOK",
