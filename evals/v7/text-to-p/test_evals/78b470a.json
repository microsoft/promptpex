  "validityText": "The input is a paragraph consisting of three sentences: \"History educates us.\", \"Lessons are learned.\", and \"Mistakes are avoided.\". According to the input specification, the paragraph must contain at least three sentences, which this input complies with. There are no requirements in the specification regarding the use of HTML tags, but the specification does allow for the use of <strong> and <em> tags if suitable. However, their absence doesn't constitute a violation.\n\nUpon evaluation, the input contains exactly the minimum required number of sentences, fulfilling this aspect of the specification. There are no other disallowed structural elements or formatting issues according to the specification.\n\nTherefore, after carefully considering the input and the specification, there are no violations. My reasoning is based purely on the explicit rule requiring a minimum of three sentences, which is met.\n\nOK",
