  "validityText": "The input provided consists of a paragraph with three sentences: \"The internet has connected the world like never before.\", \"Information is now at our fingertips.\", and \"This can be both a blessing and a curse.\". This satisfies the requirement of containing at least three sentences. However, there is no indication or presence of emphasized words or phrases using <strong> or <em> tags, but these tags are not stated as mandatory in the specification. The specification simply allows for the inclusion of emphasized words, without mandating them. As such, not using these tags is still in compliance with the specification.\n\nOK",
