  "validityText": "The input provided is a paragraph of text containing the following sentences:\n\n1. Gardening can be a peaceful hobby.\n2. It connects people with nature.\n3. Growing plants from seeds is a rewarding experience.\n\nThe input specification requires that the paragraph contain at least three sentences, which is satisfied here as there are three distinct sentences. The specification also allows for the use of <strong> and <em> tags for emphasis, although their usage is not necessary for compliance. There is no requirement in the specification for such tags to be present, so the absence of them in this paragraph does not violate the input specification. Therefore, the input fully meets the input specification.\n\nOK",
