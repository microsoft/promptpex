  "validityText": "The input is a paragraph of text that contains three sentences. The sentences are: \"Rivers flow gently through countryside terrains.\", \"They provide water and sustain life.\", and \"Many civilizations have thrived on their banks.\". The paragraph meets the specification of being long enough to contain at least three sentences. However, the specification also notes that the paragraph can include words or phrases that can be emphasized using <strong> and <em> tags. While this is not mandatory, the absence of any emphasized text does not violate the specification, as it appears optional.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",
