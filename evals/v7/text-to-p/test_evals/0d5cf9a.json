  "validityText": "The input is a paragraph that does contain at least three sentences, so it meets the first requirement of the input specification. The input specification also mentions that the paragraph can include words or phrases that can be emphasized using <strong> and <em> tags, although it does not require it. Therefore, the absence of these tags does not make the input non-compliant. As the specification simply requires the inclusion of at least three sentences, and this criterion is adequately met, the input is compliant with the specification.\n\nOK",
