It is a <em>valuable</em> habit that <em>enriches</em> the mind.</p>\n<p>It <strong>improves</strong> both <em>vocabulary</em> and <em>comprehension skills</em>, allowing individuals to <em>effectively</em> engage with text.</p>\n<p><strong>People who read</strong> regularly tend to <em>understand</em> complex topics <em>better</em>, fostering a <em>deeper</em> understanding of <em>various</em> subjects.</p>\n```",
  "validityText": "The given input is a paragraph of text consisting of three sentences: \"Reading books can increase knowledge.\", \"It improves vocabulary and comprehension skills.\", and \"People who read regularly tend to understand complex topics better.\" This satisfies the requirement of containing at least three sentences.\n\nHowever, the input specification also mentions that the text can include words or phrases that can be emphasized using <strong> and <em> tags. This means the input specification allows for, but does not mandate the use of HTML tags in the text provided. Since the specification does not require their presence, their absence does not constitute a violation.\n\nTherefore, the input technically complies with the specification as it meets the minimum length requirement regarding the number of sentences and does not violate any other stated rules.\n\nOK",
