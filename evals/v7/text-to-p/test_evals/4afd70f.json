  "validityText": "The input provided is a short paragraph consisting of three sentences. According to the input specification, the paragraph must be long enough to contain at least three sentences. This requirement is met, as there are exactly three sentences present in the input text: \"Television entertains.\", \"Radio informs.\", and \"Internet connects.\".\n\nThe specification also allows for the inclusion of words or phrases that can be emphasized using <strong> and <em> tags. However, the specification does not mandate the presence of such emphasized elements; it simply allows for them if needed. Therefore, the absence of <strong> and <em> tags does not constitute a violation of the specification.\n\nGiven that the input satisfies the requirement of having at least three sentences, and there are no violations related to optional emphasis using <strong> and <em> tags, the input complies with the specification.\n\nOK",
