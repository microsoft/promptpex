We <em>cherish</em> every <em>moment</em>.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe <strong>cherish</strong> every moment. <em>Live</em> with <em>purpose</em>.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Live</em> with <strong>purpose</strong>. <em>Life</em> is <em>beautiful</em>.\n</p>\n```",
  "validityText": "The input consists of a paragraph that contains exactly three sentences, which meets the requirement of having at least three sentences. However, the input specification also states that the paragraph can include words or phrases that can be emphasized using `<strong>` and `<em>` tags. \n\nWhile this part is optional (as indicated by \"can include\" in the specification), there is no explicit emphasis present in the input, which could be considered a lack of utilization of that option. However, since the use of emphasis is not a mandatory requirement, the absence of `<strong>` and `<em>` tags does not constitute non-compliance.\n\nThus, based solely on the input specification, the input does indeed meet all stated requirements: it is a paragraph of text long enough to contain at least three sentences, and the possibility for emphasis is acknowledged as optional, not compulsory. Therefore, there is no violation of the input specification.\n\nOK",
