  "coverage": "```html\n<p>A <strong>well-balanced diet</strong> is <em>vital</em> for <em>good health</em>.</p>\n<p>It <strong>provides</strong> necessary <em>nutrients</em> to the <em>body</em>.</p>\n<p>Eating <strong>variety</strong> is <em>important</em> to <em>ensure balance</em> in meals.</p>\n```",
  "validityText": "My evaluation begins with checking if the input is a paragraph containing at least three sentences. The input provided is indeed a paragraph. It contains three sentences: \"A well-balanced diet is vital for good health.\" \"It provides necessary nutrients to the body.\" and \"Eating variety is important to ensure balance in meals.\" This satisfies the requirement for a minimum of three sentences. \n\nNext, I examine whether the paragraph is formatted as HTML with potential use of <strong> and <em> tags for emphasis. However, the evaluation of HTML formatting is subject to interpretation since the input could be considered compliant if it simply needs formatting rather than already being formatted. Since the specification does not explicitly require the paragraph to be pre-formatted in HTML, I will interpret the formatting as a task to be performed, not a prerequisite.\n\nSince the paragraph contains at least three sentences and the specification does not mandate pre-existing HTML tags, the input complies with the given specification.\n\nOK",
