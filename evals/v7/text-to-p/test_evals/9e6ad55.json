  "validityText": "The input paragraph consists of three sentences: \"Rain falls from the sky.\", \"Clouds gather in the horizon.\", and \"Storms brew unpredictably.\". The input specification requires that the input must be a paragraph of text with at least three sentences. This condition is satisfied since the input indeed contains three distinct sentences. The specification also mentions that the paragraph \"can include words or phrases\" that can be emphasized using `<strong>` and `<em>` tags, but this is optional and not a requirement. The absence of such tags or emphasis in the input does not violate any requirement in the specification. Therefore, based on the input specification, the input complies fully and there is no evidence of any non-compliance.\n\nOK",
