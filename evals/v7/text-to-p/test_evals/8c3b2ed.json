  "validityText": "The given input is a paragraph with three sentences: \"Poetry captures emotions in succinct lines.\", \"Poets use words to paint vivid images.\", and \"It's a powerful medium for expressing feelings and thoughts.\" This satisfies the requirement for the paragraph to be long enough to contain at least three sentences as per the input specification. \n\nHowever, the input does not include any words or phrases that are emphasized using <strong> and <em> tags, which could be a potential reason for non-compliance since the specification allows for the inclusion of emphasized text, but it does not state that it is mandatory. Therefore, the absence of emphasis tags does not violate the specification.\n\nGiven that the paragraph meets the minimum requirement of three sentences and does not explicitly violate any part of the specification, it complies with the input specification.\n\nOK",
