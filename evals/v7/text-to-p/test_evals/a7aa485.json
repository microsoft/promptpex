  "validityText": "The given input consists of three sentences, which aligns with the requirement that the paragraph must contain at least three sentences. However, I need to check for compliance with the emphasis requirement as well. The input does not contain any words or phrases that are formatted using <strong> or <em> tags to emphasize them. The input specification mentions that the paragraph can include words or phrases that can be emphasized, but it does not state that it must do so. Therefore, the absence of <strong> or <em> tags does not violate the specification since their inclusion is optional.\n\nOK",
