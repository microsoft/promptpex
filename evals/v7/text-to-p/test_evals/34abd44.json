  "coverage": "```html\n<p>Sports bring <em>people</em> together in <strong>celebration</strong>.</p>\n<p>They <strong>teach</strong> <em>discipline</em> and <em>teamwork</em>.</p>\n<p>Watching a <em>game</em> can be <strong>thrilling</strong> and <em>emotional</em>.</p>\n```",
  "validityText": "Upon evaluating the input against the specification, my decision is based on the following reasoning:\n\nThe input is a paragraph that contains three sentences:\n1. \"Sports bring people together in celebration.\"\n2. \"They teach discipline and teamwork.\"\n3. \"Watching a game can be thrilling and emotional.\"\n\nThis satisfies the requirement that the paragraph must be long enough to contain at least three sentences.\n\nHowever, the input specification mentions that the paragraph can include words or phrases that can be emphasized using `<strong>` and `<em>` tags. The word \"can\" suggests that the inclusion of emphasis tags is optional, not mandatory. Therefore, the lack of `<strong>` or `<em>` tags in the input doesn't violate the specification.\n\nAs there are no violations of the input specification in the provided input, I conclude that it fully complies with the requirements.\n\nOK",
