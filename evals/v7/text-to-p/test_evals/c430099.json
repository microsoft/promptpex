  "validityText": "The input must be evaluated against the provided input specification. The specification requires the paragraph to include at least three sentences and allows the use of HTML tags for emphasis. \n\n1. **Three Sentences Requirement**: The input consists of three sentences: \"Books open new worlds.\", \"Authors share insights.\", and \"Readers gain knowledge.\". This complies with the requirement for a paragraph to have at least three sentences.\n\n2. **Use of HTML Tags**: The specification allows but does not mandate the use of <strong> and <em> tags. The absence of these tags does not constitute a violation of the specification as their use is optional.\n\nGiven that the input meets the three-sentence requirement and not using emphasis tags is not a violation, the input complies with the specification.\n\nOK",
