  "validityText": "The given input is a paragraph of text containing three sentences: \"Painting is a form of expression.\", \"Artists convey emotions through their work.\", and \"Every brushstroke tells a part of their story.\". The input specification requires that the paragraph must contain at least three sentences, which this input does.\n\nHowever, the specification also mentions that the paragraph can include words or phrases that can be emphasized using `<strong>` and `<em>` tags. This does not seem to be mandatory, but rather optional, as the wording \"can include\" does not imply a requirement. Therefore, the lack of emphasized words or phrases does not constitute a violation of the specification.\n\nSince the input paragraph meets the requirement of containing at least three sentences, and the optional use of `<strong>` and `<em>` tags is not a mandatory rule, the input complies with the input specification.\n\nOK",
