  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output doesn't comply with the specified format in the description. The description clearly instructs that each category should provide a comma-separated list of relevant elements. However, the output does not adhere to this in the following ways:\n\n1. \"People names\" and \"Company names\" do not end with a comma or a placeholder like \"-||-\" if there are no additional elements to list. Rather, the list consists only of single entries.\n\n2. \"Specific topics\" has an entry \"Unordered list\" which is suspect as unordered list is a structural term rather than a topic or content-related item, but since we don't have the input text, we can't make a final compliance decision based on this.\n\n3. Additionally, there is an unnecessary explanation section included in the output that is not part of the specified format. The description indicates a straightforward presentation of extracted elements without additional explanation.\n\nGiven these considerations, the output does not fully comply with the described format. To comply, the output should strictly follow the outlined format without additional explanations or structural deviations.\n\nERR"
