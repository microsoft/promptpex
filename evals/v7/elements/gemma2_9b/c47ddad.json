The format specified in the chatbot description requires:\n\n1. \"Company names\" followed by a list, if empty they should be represented as \"–||–\".\n2. \"People names\" followed by a list, if empty they should be represented as \"–||–\".\n3. \"Specific topics\" followed by a list, if empty they should be represented as \"–||–\".\n4. \"General themes\" followed by a list, if empty they should be represented as \"–||–\".\n\nUpon examining the chatbot's output:\n\n- The section \"Company names\" is correctly followed by \"-||-\", indicating no company names extracted.\n- The section \"People names\" is correctly followed by \"-||-\", indicating no people names extracted.\n- The section \"Specific topics\" has a list of topics, which complies with the description.\n- The section \"General themes\" has a list of themes, which complies with the description.\n\nThere are no direct violations of the format in terms of structure, as each category is addressed as per the pattern provided.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
