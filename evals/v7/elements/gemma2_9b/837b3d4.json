  "complianceText": "The output provided by the chatbot does not fully comply with the required format as stated in the description. The issue here is that there is unexpected content in the output which includes explanations for each category (\"Company Names\", \"People Names\", \"Specific Topics\", \"General Themes\"). The description does not call for explanations about why certain elements were or were not extracted. Instead, it specifies a strict format where only the extracted elements should be listed in comma-separated form for each category.\n\n- The section \"Company names:\" is correctly followed by an empty space, indicating no company names were extracted, which complies with the format.\n- \"People names:\" also correctly shows an empty space as no people names were extracted.\n- \"Specific topics:\" and \"General themes:\" are correctly formatted with topics extracted and listed as requested.\n- However, the additional explanations provided after the extractions deviate from the specified format.\n\nThe explanation sections are not part of the format described in the prompt description. They interfere with the clarity and simplicity that the specified format is designed to achieve.\n\nERR"
