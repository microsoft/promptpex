  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output does not comply with the desired format as described. The required format demands a structured output with labels followed by a comma-separated list for each category. In the chatbot's output, each category is followed by sentences or explanations rather than a list format. Additionally, the category labels themselves do not follow the given format as they are not succeeded by a colon and do not use the same phrasing (i.e., \"Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\"). This deviation from the specified desired format is a clear violation.\n\nERR"
