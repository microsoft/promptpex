The description outlines that the output should extract information from a given text and present that information in the specified format. However, the current output is a prompt rather than an extracted analysis. It asks for the text to be provided and states what it will do with the input, rather than actually performing any extraction and presenting the results according to the desired format. The chatbot should have produced a listing under each category, regardless of the input provided, to comply with the rules specified about structuring the information.\n\nERR"
