  "complianceText": "The output provided by the chatbot doesn't adhere fully to the required format as specified in the description. The desired format outlined asks for \"<comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\", \"<comma_separated_list_of_people_names>\", \"<comma_separated_list_of_specific_topics>\", and \"<comma_separated_list_of_general_themes>\". In the chatbot's output, for \"Company names\" and \"People names\", it is blank and should at least show empty placeholders if no entities are found. For \"Specific topics\", the output is given as a plain text list rather than indicating it as a comma-separated list as per the description. Similarly, for \"General themes\", although there is a comma separating the themes, it's not clear if it follows broad comma-separation convention since it's not in a list format.\n\nThe description also specifies presenting each category as a defined list format, which isn't precisely followed in the given response as it omits the expected format for some parts, even if empty. Also, the chatbot added an additional sentence, \"Let me know if you have any other texts you'd like me to analyze!\", which is not mentioned in the desired output format. This indicates a deviation as it's outside what's specified in the completion description. \n\nERR"
