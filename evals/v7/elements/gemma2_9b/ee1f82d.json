The sections should still have used this format possibly with an empty list.\n\nThere is a violation in maintaining the precise format for listing entities, which was specified as \"<comma_separated_list_of...>\", and thus was not adhered to in sections where \"---\" was used. Due to these inconsistencies with the required template formatting, this represents a non-compliance issue.\n\nERR"
