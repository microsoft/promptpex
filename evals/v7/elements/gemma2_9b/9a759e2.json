However, there are some issues: \n\n- For \"Company names,\" the output shows just a heading without any values or the expected placeholder \"-||-\". Instead, there should be a comma-separated list of company names or, if no companies are found, a placeholder \"-||-\" as specified.  \n- For \"People names,\" the output correctly uses the placeholder \"-||-\" indicating no people names were found. \n- \"Specific topics\" contains a list of topics which seem to adhere to the format requirements.\n- \"General themes\" contains one theme which seems to also adhere to the format requirements.\n\nThe violation is due to the omission of the correct placeholder or content for \"Company names.\"\n\nERR"
