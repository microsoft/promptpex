According to the description, the expected format specifies that the extracted elements should be listed as comma-separated lists for company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. Additionally, the output provided starts correctly with the labels \"Company names:\", \"People names:\", \"Specific topics:\", and \"General themes:\", but the fields for \"Company names\" and \"People names\" are left empty without even indicating a list format with a placeholder like a comma. The format requires inclusion of the commas to maintain a consistent structure, even if no specific items are listed.\n\nERR"
