The output follows this order and format precisely as:\n\n- Company names are listed followed by a colon, even though none are mentioned.\n- People names are listed in a comma-separated list after a colon.\n- Specific topics are provided in a comma-separated list after a colon.\n- General themes are similarly listed after a colon.\n\nMoreover, the explanation provided by the chatbot does not affect the compliance with the description. Therefore, the output strictly adheres to the required formatting and categorization.\n\nOK"
