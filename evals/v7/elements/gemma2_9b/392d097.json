According to the guidelines, the extracted elements should be listed in comma-separated form with headings that specify:\n\n1. Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\n2. People names: <comma_separated_list_of_people_names>\n3. Specific topics: <comma_separated_list_of_specific_topics>\n4. General themes: <comma_separated_list_of_general_themes>\n\nIn the output, the heading format is not fully accurate as specified. Specifically, the part **<comma_separated_list_of_...>** is not correctly implemented. For instance:\n\n- **Company names** should be \"Khan Academy\" (though there is only one, it should still be in the specified format).\n- **People names** should be listed in the same format even if there's a single name.\n- The terms \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\" should adhere to the same formatting requirements, using comma-separated lists, even though the content aligns with expectations.\n\nThe headings used here differ slightly by being in bold, although the issue lies more in the compliance with using <comma_separated_list_of_...> instead.\n\nERR"
