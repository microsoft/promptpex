The output is formatted in a clean and structured way with separations between company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes, as specified in the description. However, the list of company names and people names is missing. According to the description, there should be a section for company names and people names that needs to be provided in the output, even if it means leaving them as empty or indicating that none were found. The absence of these two elements means the output does not fully comply with the format specified.\n\nERR"
