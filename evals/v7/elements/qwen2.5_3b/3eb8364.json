  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not comply with the desired format specified in the description. The description specifies that each category (Company names, People names, Specific topics, General themes) should be followed by a comma-separated list of elements, even if the list is empty, it should reflect that format, likely using a placeholder or similar notation, as demonstrated by the \"-||-\" used for People names in the output. Furthermore, the Specific topics section seems incorrect based on given instructions, where the ideal format should have a comma-separated list, followed by \"-||-\", even if empty. \n\nAdditionally, the explanation provided in the note section, although informative, does not adhere to the desired format of the output, and it should have been structured as per the format requirements without additional commentary not specified in the guidelines.\n\nERR"
