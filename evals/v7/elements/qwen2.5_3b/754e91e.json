  "complianceText": "The output needs to comply with the format specified in the description. In the \"Company names\" section, the output uses a comma-separated list and there is no space after the comma, which is inconsistent with standard listing conventions. However, since the format in the description does not explicitly mandate a space after commas, this can be accepted. The \"People names\" section correctly uses the placeholder \"-||-\" as per the desired format, indicating that no people names were extractable, which is compliant with the description.\n\nThe \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\" sections also conform to the required format, with each listing a comma-separated list of items. Notably, each section ends without a period, but this too is not specified as a requirement in the description format. As all sections follow the specified format regarding the use of placeholders or lists, despite the stylistic choice of no spaces which can be considered valid unless strictly specified, the output retains compliance with the given description.\n\nOK"
