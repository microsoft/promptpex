However, the name is not in a comma-separated format. Instead, it is listed with a hyphen, which deviates from the specific description of using a comma-separated list.\n   - \"Specific topics\" follow the \"People names.\"\n   - \"General themes\" are last in the format.\n\n2. **Compliance with Description**:\n   - The \"Company names\" section is correctly in comma-separated format.\n   - The \"People names\" section does not follow the comma-separated format described. Instead, it uses a bullet point for a single entry.\n   - The \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\" are listed and seem to reflect categories relevant to their sections.\n   \nThe primary violation is in the format for \"People names,\" which should be a comma-separated list rather than using bullet points or hyphens.\n\nERR"
