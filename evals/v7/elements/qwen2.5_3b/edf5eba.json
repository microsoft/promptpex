  "complianceText": "Upon evaluation of the chatbot's output, the format is mostly compliant with the described format, with one notable exception. The output does not include a list of people names, as required by the desired format. The section for \"People names\" is left blank, whereas the description explicitly requires it to be a comma-separated list, even if empty. Each category should have a comma-separated list, even if it means stating ‘None’ or similar placeholder when no entities are extracted.\n\nIn the \"General themes\" section, the items are separated by slashes instead of commas. The desired format specifies that all themes should be presented as a comma-separated list rather than using slashes. Because of these formatting deviations, the output does not fully comply with the description guidelines.\n\nERR"
