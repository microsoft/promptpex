  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not comply with the desired format as outlined in the description. Here's my reasoning:\n\n- The \"People names\" field is marked with \"-||-\", which indicates that no people names were extracted. However, in the note, it mentions \"CEO Sundar Pichai\" is considered a person name, which contradicts the format requirement and classification in the output.\n- The description specifies the format where \"Company names,\" \"People names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and \"General themes\" should each be followed by a \"<comma_separated_list_of_names>\". The \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\" appear to meet this requirement, but the inconsistency with the \"People names\" not adhering to the description suggests a violation.\n\nTherefore, due to the inconsistency with the \"People names\" field, the output has a compliance issue.\n\nERR"
