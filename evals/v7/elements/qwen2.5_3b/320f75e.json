The expected format requires a list of company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes to be clearly separated and listed after respective labels (with comma-separated list for each category). In the output provided:\n\n1. The entry for \"Company names\" does not follow the provided format as there is not a comma-separated list; it only shows lines for each category.\n2. \"People names\" expects a comma-separated list, whereas in the output there's a single dash \"-\", which does not fit the desired format.\n3. \"Specific topics\" also just links to a line and lacks a proper list or even any item.\n4. \"General themes\" is presented with an example 'General guidance principle' but again, it does not follow the format of being a list.\n\nThese elements indicate that the output is not formatted according to the specification described for listing extracted items.\n\nERR"
