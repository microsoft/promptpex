  "output": "Company names: \nPeople names: -||-\nSpecific topics: quantum physics, human space travel, scientific progress, exploration  \nGeneral themes: scientific discovery, scientific progress, human potential, technological advancements",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot output provides four sections that should align with the desired format: Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes. \n\n1. **Company names**: The format specifies a comma-separated list of company names is expected here, but the list is empty after \"Company names:\". However, without the input text, it's unclear whether this is due to the absence of companies in the text. Since compliance with format rather than content is the focus, this is arguable but not definitively non-compliant given the lack of input text.\n\n2. **People names**: The placeholder \"-||-\" is used as specified when there are no people names to list. This complies with the desired format.\n\n3. **Specific topics**: The topics are listed in a comma-separated format, which complies with the desired format.\n\n4. **General themes**: The themes are also listed in a comma-separated format, complying with the desired format.\n\nOverall, the output maintains the correct structure as described, assuming the absence of company names in the input text justifies the empty list for company names. Therefore, the response adheres to the desired format and structure provided in the description, without evidence of a format violation.\n\nOK"
