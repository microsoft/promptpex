The desired format is:\n\n- Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\n- People names: -||-\n- Specific topics: -||-\n- General themes: -||-\n\nHere is my evaluation of the chatbot's output compliance with the description:\n\n1. **Company names**: The output states \"Company names: Ford\", which complies with the desired format. Although there is only one company name, the format is still technically correct.\n\n2. **People names**: The output states \"People names: -||-\", which correctly follows the format for indicating no people names were found.\n\n3. **Specific topics**: The output states \"Specific topics: -||-\", which correctly follows the format for indicating no specific topics were found.\n\n4. **General themes**: The output states \"General themes: automotive, innovation, sustainability\". This complies with the format for general themes, as a comma-separated list of themes is provided.\n\nConsidering these points, the output adheres to the required format for each of these categories. The format and separation were maintained as per the description's requirements.\n\nOK"
