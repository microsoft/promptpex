According to the description, the output should list \"Company names\" and \"People names\" as comma-separated lists. In the output provided, \"Company names\" is followed by an empty space which suggests that this section is incomplete or missing information. While it's possible that there are no company names in the input text, the same format is not replicated in \"People names\", which uses \"-||-\" indicating it needs to be parallelly checked.\n\nSince there is an inconsistency in formatting and a section potentially missing information without following a standard for when categories have no entries, this indicates a non-compliance with the description.\n\nERR"
