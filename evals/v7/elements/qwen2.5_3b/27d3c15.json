  "complianceText": "The output is in the desired format, listing the entities under the respective categories: \"Company names\", \"People names\", \"Specific topics\", and \"General themes\". The description specifies the use of the format `<comma_separated_list_of_...>`, which is adhered to for company names. However, for \"People names\", the format `-||-` is used, which is also correct per the description when no names are present. Therefore, there is no violation of format rules in the output. The detailed entries under \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\" are given in a comma-separated list as required and no input is given, so there's no way to verify if these elements match the text content.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
