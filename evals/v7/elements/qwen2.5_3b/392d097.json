  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output follows the required format in several aspects, but there are some violations. The format requires specific sections labeled as \"Company names,\" \"People names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and \"General themes.\" The output begins correctly with \"Company names: Khan Academy,\" which adheres to the format. However, for the section \"People names,\" it incorrectly uses the placeholder \"-||-\" as a key instead of a value, which deviates from the described format. Similarly, the re-use of \"-||-\" as a key is not consistent with the output format described, where it is supposed to signify repetition or continuation for values, not as a substitute for actual keys. Because of these deviations in adhering to the format specification, there is a non-compliance issue.\n\nERR"
