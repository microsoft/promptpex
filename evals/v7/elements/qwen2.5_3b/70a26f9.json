  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is formatted in the desired structure, separated by labels: \"Company names,\" \"People names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and \"General themes.\" Given the conditions I can check without the input:\n\n1. The \"Company names\" list is empty, which is formatted as per: `<comma_separated_list_of_company_names>`, though it does not provide specific elements, it maintains the correct format indicated by being left blank after the label.\n   \n2. The \"People names\" follows the format `-||-`, which adheres to the stated desired format for sections that might be empty or have no elements to list.\n\n3. \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\" sections contain elements in a comma-separated format which respects the output structure.\n\nBased on the provided output and adhering to the conditions that can be checked without knowing the input, there is no direct evidence of deviation from the format specified in the chatbot description. Thus, this output does comply as per the description.\n\nOK"
