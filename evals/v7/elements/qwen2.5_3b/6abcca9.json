  "complianceText": "The chatbot output partially aligns with the desired format stated in the description. The output should follow a specific format outlined as follows:\n\n1. **Company names**: It begins with \"Company names:\" followed by a list, which is correctly implemented with \"Facebook\".\n   \n2. **People names**: The placeholder \"-||-\" is correctly used to indicate no results for people names.\n\n3. **Specific topics**: The output does not use the exact placeholder \"-||-\" if there are no specific topics, but it does provide relevant topics instead. This section should also use a comma-separated list instead of bullet points.\n\n4. **General themes**: While the output provides what seems to be appropriate themes, it does not follow the comma-separated list format and instead uses bullet points.\n\nThe most significant departure from the description is the format discrepancy in the \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\" sections where bullet points are used instead of the prescribed comma-separated list. The description specifies a strict format using commas for separation rather than bullet points for the lists. \n\nERR"
