  "complianceText": "The output partially follows the desired format specified in the description but also contains additional commentary and a repetition of the extracted elements in list format. According to the description, the output should strictly adhere to the following format:\n\n```\nCompany names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\nPeople names: -||-\nSpecific topics: -||-\nGeneral themes: -||-\n```\n\nWhile the output starts in the correct format, with \"Company names\" and \"People names\" followed by a colon and the listing directly by commas, it then repeats information with additional commentary in a list format below the initial output, which deviates from the specified format. The commentary and list format are extraneous and not in accordance with the concise format described.\n\nAdditionally, the specific topics section uses a non-compliant response of \"-||-\" instead of indicating \"Not applicable\" under the original format, thus not aligning strictly with the description's format for absence of data (\"-||-\").\n\nThere's a clear deviation from the specified format and the output includes extra explanations which were not requested. \n\nERR"
