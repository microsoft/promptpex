The description asks for comma-separated lists for each category: company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. However, the output provides these in a bulleted list format. Furthermore, the general themes section seems to provide additional narrative information instead of a simple comma-separated list, which further deviates from the requested format.\n\nERR"
