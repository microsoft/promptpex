The output format requires a `<comma_separated_list_of_company_names>` after \"Company names:\", even if there are no company names to be extracted. The other elements such as \"People names:\", \"Specific topics:\", and \"General themes:\" follow the desired format as described, with \"People names:\" having the correct placeholder '-||-'. However, the omission after \"Company names:\" deviates from the specified output format where there should still be a placeholder or some indication of an intentional omission. Hence, the output does not fully comply with the description provided.\n\nERR"
