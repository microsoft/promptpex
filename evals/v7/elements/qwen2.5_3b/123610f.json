However, the \"Company names\" and \"Specific topics\" fields are missing any content, and the format used for empty fields does not match what was demonstrated in the description. The description implies that empty lists should still showcase as \"-||-\". Since the \"Company names\" and \"Specific topics\" fields are empty, they should still display \"-||-\" as the format suggests. Thus, the output does not fully comply with the desired format for presenting text elements when they are absent or unavailable.\n\nERR"
