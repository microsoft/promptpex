The \"Company names\" section uses \"(none)\" which deviates from the \"<comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\" format specified. The \"People names\" section is correctly using \"-||-\" when there are no names to list. The \"Specific topics\" section also correctly uses \"-||-\". The \"General themes\" section provides a list of themes, but one of the listed items is \"themes,\" which is redundant and seems out of place. The inclusion of \"themes\" in the list of general themes indicates a lack of specificity or is potentially an error.\n\nERR"
