  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is not completely compliant with the description. The description specifies that the extracted elements should be formatted as comma-separated lists. In the output, the \"Company names\" section only includes one name (\"Rivian\"), so the comma-separation rule doesnâ€™t come into play there. The \"People names\" section uses the placeholder \"-||-\", which is compliant with the description for cases where no people names are mentioned. However, \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\" sections correctly list multiple topics and themes, respectively, but since the format of the input is not given, it's not possible to verify whether the bot has correctly extracted all possible named entities. Since none of these elements violate explicitly the format requirement, it remains compliant. Thus, there is no non-compliance with the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
