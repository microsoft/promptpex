However, \"Collaboration (IBM with a notable individual in the tech/Internet space)\" is not a valid general theme due to specific reference in the parentheses, which should not appear based on the example format. General themes should not contain these kinds of specific suggestions or narrative content, as the description implies a simple list format.\n\nThe issue lies in the detail given in one of the \"General themes,\" not just listing overarching, generalized themes as expected. Therefore, the output does not fully comply with the chatbot description.\n\nERR"
