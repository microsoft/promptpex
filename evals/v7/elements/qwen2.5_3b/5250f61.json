It correctly uses the format with labels such as \"Company names:\", \"People names:\", \"Specific topics:\", and \"General themes:\". However, the list following \"Company names:\" is empty, which is acceptable if no company names were extracted, and thus, requires the input to verify correctness, which is not available here. For \"People names:\", it uses \"-||-\", which aligns with the description format. The \"Specific topics:\" and \"General themes:\" both contain lists of topics and themes. Based solely on compliance with the format and structure, the output appears to conform to the specification given.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
