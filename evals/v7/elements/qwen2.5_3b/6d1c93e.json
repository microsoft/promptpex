The format requires the same placeholder \"-||-\" for all sections when there are no entries to list, except for the \"Company names\" section, which deviates by using an empty placeholder rather than \"-||-\". Additionally, \"General themes\" presented have no actual extracted themes, only a vague statement \"Misplacing Quantum Physics, unclear method\" which does not adhere to a clear list as shown in the description. \n\nERR"
