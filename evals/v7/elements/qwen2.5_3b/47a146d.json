It specifies that the output should list \"Company names,\" \"People names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and \"General themes\" as comma-separated lists. The format in the output complies with the description because:\n\n1. The \"Company names\" are listed correctly, each on separate lines and separated by commas, which complies with the example format given (although the exact wording of \"comma_separated_list_of_company_names\" suggests commas, as interpreted literally).\n2. For \"People names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and \"General themes,\" the output correctly uses \"-||-\" to denote that no elements were found or the extraction was not applicable, in accordance with the specified format.\n\nThe reasoning is straightforward and based entirely on the given output format requirements from the description. No part of this evaluation requires knowledge of the input text beyond what was extracted.\n\nOK"
