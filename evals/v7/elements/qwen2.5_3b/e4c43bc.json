  "complianceText": "The chatbot output partially complies with the format specified in the description. The output provides extracted information under the correct categories: Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes. However, there are compliance issues:\n\n1. **People names**: The output shows \"-||-\" which suggests no people names are extracted. While using \"-||-\" is compliant with the format for an empty list, without knowledge of the input, I cannot verify if a lack of extracted people names is correct.\n\n2. **Comma-separated lists**: The output provides the company name \"JP Morgan\", however, this is correctly formatted as it consists of a single company name. \n\n3. **Specific topics**: The output lists \"Financial innovation\" and \"Cryptocurrency developments\" as specific topics. A bullet-point format here deviates from the expected comma-separated list format indicated in the description.\n\n4. **General themes**: The output for general themes is provided in a bulleted list rather than the expected comma-separated format.\n\nGiven that the output does not maintain the specified comma-separated list format for Specific topics and General themes, it does not fully comply with the format described in the instructions.\n\nERR"
