According to the chatbot description, the output should consist of a comma-separated list of entities for each category: 'Company names', 'People names', 'Specific topics', and 'General themes'. In this output, 'Company names' is left empty, and 'Specific topics' contains a phrase \"prolonged absence of themes\", which doesn't align with the expected comma-separated list format. The list structure for this category is incorrectly provided as a descriptive phrase instead of an enumeration. 'People names' and 'General themes' are correctly represented according to the '-||-' syntax for absence of content. \n\nERR"
