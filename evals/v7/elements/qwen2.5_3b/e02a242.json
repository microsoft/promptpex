Looking at the output, we find:\n\n1. **Company Names**: This field seems compliant with the format, as it contains a comma-separated list (even if it's a single name here).\n\n2. **People Names**: The \"People names\" field uses the \"-||-\" placeholder, which indicates no people names were found, complying with the description format.\n\n3. **Specific Topics**: This section lists topics but is not presented as a simple \"-||-\" placeholder format as seen in other sections. The example format in the description uses \"-||-\" as a placeholder when there is nothing to extract. Therefore, this does not comply with the expected structure.\n\n4. **General Themes**: This section lists themes but is not consistent with a simple \"-||-\" placeholder format. Like \"Specific Topics\", it deviates from the described format.\n\nThe violation is due to sections not using the expected placeholder format. The description sets a clear standard for using \"-||-\" when there are no elements to list, and it is not followed in the \"Specific Topics\" and \"General Themes\" sections.\n\nERR"
