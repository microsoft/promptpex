According to the description, it should format the output with a comma-separated list for each category. The output correctly represents each category as a list in JSON format, which does not conflict with the requirement for a comma-separated list. While we cannot verify the correctness of the content without the input, the structure of the output complies with the expected format. There are no missing categories; all four elements are present, even if some are empty, which still aligns with the requirement.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
