Since there is no way to evaluate the correctness of the extracted elements without knowing the input text, I cannot assess if the explanation provided here is justified or not. Therefore, I can only verify that the format adheres to the instructions in the description. The compliance check only concerns the adherence to the specified structure, and the output is consistent with that structure.\n\nOK"
