  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not fully comply with the specified format in the description. The violations are as follows:\n\n1. **Format for Lists**: The instruction specifies that the extracted information should be listed as a comma-separated list for each category (e.g., Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>). However, the output uses a separate line format for \"People names\", \"Specific topics\", and \"General themes\", each item being on a new line rather than a comma-separated format. This does not comply with the output format specified in the description.\n\n2. **Format Under \"Specific Topics\"**: The output states that there are no entities specified under \"Specific topics,\" yet it lists three topics. This creates a contradiction and confusion in the output presentation. It does not align with the description which expected a clear list, if available.\n\n3. **Use of Bullet Points**: The output uses bullet points for presenting \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\", whereas the description requests a comma-separated list for all categories. This violation of format adds to the non-compliance.\n\nDue to these identified issues, the output does not meet the required compliance as detailed in the chatbot description.\n\nERR"
