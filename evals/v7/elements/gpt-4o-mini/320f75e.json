The description specifies the need for a list of comma-separated items for each category (Company names, People names, Specific topics, General themes). However, in the output, \"General themes\" is provided as a non-comma-separated phrase \"General guidance, principles\" instead of explicitly separating each theme. Additionally, the output improperly uses the placeholder \"-||-\" for \"Specific topics,\" which should instead have been populated with the comma-separated items or left empty if no specific topics are identified.\n\nERR"
