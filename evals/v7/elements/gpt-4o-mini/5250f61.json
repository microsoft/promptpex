  "complianceText": "The chatbot output generally follows the specified format laid out in the description. The output has distinct sections labeled with 'Company names:', 'People names:', 'Specific topics:', and 'General themes:', each followed by a list of items, which corresponds to the structure required by the description.\n\nThe only possible deviation lies in how the lists are represented. Instead of using a \"<comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\", \"<comma_separated_list_of_people_names>\", \"<comma_separated_list_of_specific_topics>\", and \"<comma_separated_list_of_general_themes>\", the lists are displayed in a space-separated format. The description specifies \"comma_separated_list\", which implies there should be commas separating the entries within each list.\n\nThis divergence from the desired \"comma_separated_list\" format could be considered a violation. \n\nERR"
