The format requires lists for company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes to be separated by commas if there are multiple elements. In the output provided:\n\n1. **Company names**: The format is \"Company names: Nike\". It follows the desired format since it is a single entity and does not require commas.\n\n2. **People names**: Similarly, \"People names: Serena Williams\" follows the format for a single entity without the need for commas.\n\n3. **Specific topics** and **General themes**: These sections include multiple elements separated by commas, as specified in the desired format.\n\nThe output adheres to the required structure, with different sections clearly defined and following the comma-separated list rule where necessary. I do not need to know the input to ascertain whether it follows the specified format structure, only that the comma-separated listing is applied where needed and not misapplied elsewhere.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
