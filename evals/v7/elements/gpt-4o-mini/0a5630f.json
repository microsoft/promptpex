According to the description, the output should include a section for company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. Each section must be filled with a \"<comma_separated_list>\" of items, even if the list is empty. In this case, the sections for \"Company names\" and \"People names\" are present but lack any listed items. The expected format should still include placeholders or a representation indicating that these sections are intentionally left blank, such as \"none\" or an empty string. This would provide a clearer representation of extracting elements according to the specified format. Additionally, each section should conclude with \"-||-\", which is missing from the \"Company names\" and \"People names\" sections.\n\nERR"
