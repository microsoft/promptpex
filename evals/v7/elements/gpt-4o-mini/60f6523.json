  "complianceText": "The output does not comply with the description for the following reasons:\n\n1. **Company names**: The output provides an empty line for company names, but it should consistently use the format \"<comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\", which implies that if there are no company names to list, it should state \"None\" or similar, rather than leaving it blank.\n\n2. **General themes**: The general themes listed are \"technology, society, impacts\". While these could be overarching themes, it's difficult to determine their alignment without the input text. However, given the output format, they are treated as their own list. \n\nTherefore, since the output leaves the \"Company names\" section improperly formatted by having it blank rather than indicating no entries explicitly, it violates the compliance requirement with the description.\n\nERR"
