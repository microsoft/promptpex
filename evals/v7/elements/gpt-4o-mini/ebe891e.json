  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output starts with the section \"Company names:\", followed by a list of company names in a comma-separated format. However, the provided output includes only one company name without a comma-separated list format. According to the desired output format mentioned in the description, even if there is only one entity, it must follow the \"<comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\" format, which implies that it should follow a consistent format of listing, potentially including or allowing for commas.\n\nAdditionally, the same formatting inconsistency is observed in all other sections too, including \"People names:\", \"Specific topics:\", and \"General themes:\". Each section lists only one entity or word without using the stated comma-separated list format. The description implies that the format should align with \"<comma_separated_list_of_entities>\". \n\nGiven these formatting issues, the output does not comply strictly with the described format requirement. \n\nERR"
