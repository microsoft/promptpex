The \"Company names\" and \"People names\" sections are left empty and should at least have a placeholder if no names are identified, such as \"None\" or something similar if the input actually does not contain any, which I cannot check without the input.\n\n2. Each section of the desired format is present, but the empty fields for companies and people could potentially violate the expectation of formatted output. \n\nBased on these observations, there is a compliance violation.\n\nERR"
