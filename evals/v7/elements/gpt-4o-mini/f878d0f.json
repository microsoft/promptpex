  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output should be evaluated based on the format described in the chatbot's description. According to the description, the desired output format is:\n\n- Company names: `<comma_separated_list_of_company_names>`\n- People names: `<comma_separated_list_of_people_names>`\n- Specific topics: `<comma_separated_list_of_specific_topics>`\n- General themes: `<comma_separated_list_of_general_themes>`\n\nIn the given output:\n\n1. **Format Compliance**:\n   - The list of company names is not separated by commas because only one name is present. This technically does not violate if there is only one name.\n   - The list of people names is not separated by commas as there is only one name. This also doesn't technically violate the requirement if there is only one name.\n   - The list of specific topics is not in a comma-separated list. The items are separated by commas, which matches the requirement.\n   - The list of general themes is appropriately in a comma-separated format.\n\n2. **Section Presence**:\n   - All four sections (Company names, People names, Specific topics, General themes) are present in the output, complying with the description.\n\nThe output format mostly complies with the given description. Each section is properly labeled and includes the relevant information as per the desired format's specification.\n\nOK"
