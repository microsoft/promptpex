In the output provided, \"Company names\" has neither a comma-separated list nor '-||-' which indicates a lack of items. Similarly, the \"People names\" category is in the correct format with '-||-', \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\" categories also follow the correct format. However, the missing format for \"Company names\" constitutes a violation of the description requirements.  \n\nERR"
