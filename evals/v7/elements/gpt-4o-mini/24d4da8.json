  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is mostly compliant with the description provided. It follows the desired format by listing company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. Each category is clearly labeled, and the items within each category are separated by commas or line breaks where expected. However, the format specified in the desired output is a \"comma_separated_list\" for each category.\n\nThe output for \"Company names\" and \"People names\" follows the correct labeling but does not use a comma-separated list as instructed. Instead, it uses a new line, which deviates from the exact format specified.\n\nThe \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\" fields are lists, but they also do not use commas, which also deviates from the requirement for a \"comma_separated_list_of_<category>.\"\n\nBecause of the deviation from the specified \"comma_separated_list\" format in all categories, the output does not fully comply with the description.\n\nERR"
