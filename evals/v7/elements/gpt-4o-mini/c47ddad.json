However, the list under \"Company names\" is empty, meaning there is a non-compliance with the description. The desired format requires a list of company names, even if that list is explicitly marked as empty with some indication (such as 'None' or 'N/A'), depending on the textual input. Since the format is not respected in this case, that leads to a violation.\n\nERR"
