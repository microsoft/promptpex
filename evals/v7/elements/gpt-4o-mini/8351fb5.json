  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output is presented in the format specified by the description, with sections for \"Company names,\" \"People names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and \"General themes.\" However, the \"Company names\" section does not provide any company names, which suggests either an absence of such information in the original text or a failure to extract them. Since I cannot determine if company names were present in the input, I will not mark this as non-compliant based on assumption. The compliance is solely judged based on structural format which it adheres to.\n\nOK"
