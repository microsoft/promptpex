While it's unknown whether the input text contained any company names, the given format requires a comma-separated list, which would at least be represented by an empty space or the word \"None\" or \"N/A\" if there are no company names to extract. The other sections comply with the required format by presenting comma-separated lists. Therefore, since the \"Company names\" section does not follow the specified format by lacking representation when empty, the output does not fully comply with the chatbot's description.\n\nERR"
