  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output is structured in the desired format: it lists \"Company names,\" \"People names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and \"General themes\" as specified in the description. Each category is presented on a separate line, following the format \"<category name>: <comma_separated_list>.\" Even though there is only one company name, the description implies that there can be a comma-separated list if there are multiple entities, so a single entry or none is acceptable. Additionally, the people names are marked as '-||-', which aligns with the format provided. The specific topics and general themes appear in a comma-separated list, complying with the description's requirement. Thus, the chatbot's output meets the structural requirements as per the description.\n\nOK"
