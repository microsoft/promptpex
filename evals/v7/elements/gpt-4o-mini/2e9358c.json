  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not follow the provided desired format. According to the description, the output should include four categories: 'Company names', 'People names', 'Specific topics', and 'General themes', each respectively listing comma-separated elements (if any). Here are the non-compliance issues in the output:\n\n1. **Company Names**: The output has nothing listed for 'Company names'. While it's possible that there were no company names in the input text, generally, if there are no elements to list, it should be represented clearly. An empty list should explicitly indicate no companies, e.g., \"Company names: None,\" to be clearer following its pattern with other categories.\n\n2. **Matching format for People names**: It uses '-||-' which suggests it matches the format for empty fields. This consistency indicates that the others should follow this standard or at least, some explicit indication that nothing is present.\n\n3. **List Separation and Phrasing**: For the 'Specific topics' and 'General themes', elements are not separated by commas, which goes against the expected format of 'comma_separated_list_of_company_names'. This is a violation as it doesn't adhere to a consistent format.\n\nGiven these points, the output does not comply with the description provided, particularly due to its improper formatting and inconsistency in the listing of identified elements.\n\nERR"
