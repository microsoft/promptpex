  "complianceText": "Upon reviewing the output, there are clear elements that do not comply with the description provided:\n\n1. **Desired Format Violation**: The chatbot output does not follow the specified format for listing extracted elements, which should be comma-separated lists prefixed by respective categories (\"Company names:\", \"People names:\", \"Specific topics:\", \"General themes:\"). The provided \"extracted_data\" section is not in alignment with this format.\n\n2. **Structural Non-compliance**: The output includes explanations for each type of data element (company names, people names, etc.), which is not part of the desired format. The description specifies a format that lists categories followed by comma-separated entities, without explanations.\n\n3. **Output Details**: The example provided at the end attempts to show the desired output format, yet the main portion of the chatbot's output still does not adhere to this required style.\n\nThese inconsistencies indicate a non-compliance with the expected format and structure as outlined in the description. \n\nERR"
