  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not adhere to the desired format as specified in the description. The format requires that each category is named and followed by a comma-separated list in a single line. Instead, the output uses section headers such as \"Extracted Information\" and \"Extraction of People Names\". Additionally, the \"Company Names\" are provided in a code block format which is not specified in the description. Furthermore, the \"Specific topics\" are more accurately a repetition of company names rather than distinct specific topics. Lastly, it is unclear whether the general overarching themes have been identified, as this section is missing entirely. These discrepancies demonstrate a clear violation of the expected format specified in the chatbot description.\n\nERR"
