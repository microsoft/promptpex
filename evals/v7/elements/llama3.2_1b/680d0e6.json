  "complianceText": "The evaluation criteria focus on compliance with the description provided and does not require knowledge of the input text. The main points to review are the format and categories provided by the chatbot.\n\n- The output lists \"Company names: N/A\", which is an acceptable representation if there are no company names to extract, assuming the input contained none.\n- The \"People names\" section includes a list of names, following the desired comma-separated list format outlined in the description, though it is not comma-separated when in a list form, which can be considered slightly off-format.\n- The \"Specific topics\" section contains a single topic, \"Artificial Intelligence,\" presented in a manner consistent with the requested comma-separated list.\n- The \"General themes\" section provides a list of general overarching themes presented in a comma-separated list, as expected.\n\nThe described format specifies the use of comma-separated lists for company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. The output partially adheres to the format, but the \"People names\" are not in the explicit comma-separated format when provided as a vertical list, which could be interpreted as a deviation from the desired format requirement.\n\nConsidering the format discrepancy in the \"People names\" section, the output slightly deviates from the specified format:\n\nERR"
