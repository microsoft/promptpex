  "complianceText": "The chatbot output partially follows the desired format outlined in the description, but not completely. The format requires the output to start with specific headings: \"Company names:\", \"People names:\", \"Specific topics:\", and \"General themes:\". Each of these categories should be followed by a comma-separated list, where applicable. In this instance:\n\n1. The output for company names provides \"None\" but does not explicitly state \"Company names: None\".\n2. The output for people names states Jane Goodall but does not follow the exact format \"People names: Jane Goodall\".\n3. Under \"Specific topics,\" there is not a clean list separated by commas; instead, multiple lines are used.\n4. The \"General themes\" section also does not comply with the desired comma-separated list format and uses an indented list instead.\n\nThe inconsistent adherence to the required format, based on the distinct heading sections and comma-separated lists, underpins the failure to comply fully with the chatbot's description requirements.\n\nERR"
