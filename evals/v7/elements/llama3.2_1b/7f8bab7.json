The description states that the extracted elements must be listed as comma-separated lists directly following the labels \"Company names:\", \"People names:\", \"Specific topics:\", and \"General themes:\". \n\nIn the provided output, the lists for \"Company names\", \"People names\", and \"Specific topics\" are not comma-separated lists. They are presented as separate lines instead. Additionally, the \"General themes\" section is missing altogether.\n\nDue to these points, the output does not comply with the format requirements specified in the chatbot description.
