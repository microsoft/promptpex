  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output shows a format that does not comply fully with the desired format as per the description. The desired format specified in the description is: \n\n- Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\n- People names: <comma_separated_list_of_people_names>\n- Specific topics: <comma_separated_list_of_specific_topics>\n- General themes: <comma_separated_list_of_general_themes>\n\nHowever, the chatbot output provided is in a bulleted list style with each segment displayed on its line. Additionally, the section for \"General Themes\" is incomplete, and there is a missing list after the \"General Themes:\". Also, the note at the end indicates some ambiguity by suggesting \"Non-secured mentionings\" might not clearly fit into one category, which is not in line with the desired format that demands strict categorization.\n\nGiven these observations, the output is not formatted as specified, leading to a non-compliance with the chatbot description.\n\nERR"
