According to the description, the extraction results should be presented in a structured format with comma-separated lists for each category (Company names, People names, Specific topics, General themes). The output provided contains irregularities:\n\n1. For \"Company names\" and \"People names,\" instead of a comma-separated list or an explicit \"None,\" the output includes explanations in parentheses, which deviates from the specified format.\n2. The \"General themes\" section provides a more detailed explanation rather than a comma-separated list, which again deviates from the required format. \n\nThese violations indicate non-compliance with the specified output format.\n\nERR"
