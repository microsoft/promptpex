  "complianceText": "The evaluation requires checking for compliance with the desired output format and structure as specified in the description.\n\n1. **Desired Format**: The chatbot output should provide lists in the following format:\n   - Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\n   - People names: -||-\n   - Specific topics: -||-\n   - General themes: -||-\n\n2. **Company Names**: The provided company names are not in a comma-separated format. Instead, they are formatted as a bullet list. Additionally, the description included alongside the company (\"The Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) ...\"), could be considered more informative than the simple list requested.\n\n3. **People Names**: Similarly, the people names are presented in a bullet list rather than comma-separated format.\n\n4. **Specific Topics and General Themes**: Again, these are displayed in a bullet list format as opposed to the requested comma-separated list.\n\nThe output violates the required list format as the elements are not comma-separated, and there is additional text accompanying some output elements. These structural disparities from the prescribed format point to a non-compliance with the chatbot's description.\n\nERR"
