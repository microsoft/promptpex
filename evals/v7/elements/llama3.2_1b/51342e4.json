  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not fully comply with the desired format specified in the description. The description requires that the extracted data be presented in a specific format:\n\n1. **Company names**: The format is correct as a comma-separated list of company names. However, the list should adhere to the \"-||-\" format if no names are extracted.\n\n2. **People names**: The output displays an empty string and a dash, which doesn't comply with the description's specified \"-||-\" format for listing people names.\n\n3. **Specific topics**: The placeholder \"-||-\" is correctly used here since no specific topics are listed.\n\n4. **General themes**: The themes are listed but do not use the \"-||-\" delimiter. While using a comma is consistent with listing company names, it is not in the strict compliance format needed for unlisted items, which should be \"-||-\" when empty.\n\nThe main issue with compliance is the lack of proper use of \"-||-\" for the sections that may not have entries, such as \"People names\" and the format consistency between other elements.\n\nERR"
