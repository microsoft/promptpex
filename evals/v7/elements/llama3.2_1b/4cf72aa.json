  "complianceText": "The output generated by the chatbot does not comply with the desired format specified in the description. The description clearly outlines that the output should be formatted as follows:\n\n- Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\n- People names: <comma_separated_list_of_people_names>\n- Specific topics: <comma_separated_list_of_specific_topics>\n- General themes: <comma_separated_list_of_general_themes>\n\nHowever, the actual output uses a structured format with YAML-like syntax under \"extracted_entities\" and breaks down the entities into separate lists rather than adhering to the desired plain text format with comma-separated values. Specifically, the issues are:\n\n1. The term \"extracted_entities\" is not part of the described format.\n2. The entities are presented as key-value pairs within a list and not as simple comma-separated lists.\n3. The format deviates from the specified plain-text lists for each category.\n\nThus, the output's structure is not compliant with the described format requirements.\n\nERR"
