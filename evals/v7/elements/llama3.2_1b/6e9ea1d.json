  "complianceText": "The chatbot output format partially complies with the desired format outlined in the description. The description specifies that the chatbot should extract four categories: company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. The output provided only contains the \"Company names\" category and lists \"Google\" as an example. \n\nAdditionally, the format uses double asterisks (**) around the heading \"Company names,\" which is not specified in the description. The desired format also requires a comma-separated list for multiple entities, which cannot be verified for correctness as it requires knowing the input. However, since the description requires extraction of multiple categories and only one is provided here, this does not fully comply with the description.\n\nERR"
