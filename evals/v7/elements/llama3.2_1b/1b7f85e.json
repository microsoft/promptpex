  "complianceText": "The output does not comply with the desired format specified in the description. Several issues are evident:\n\n1. **Formatting Errors**: The format specified in the description for extracted elements should be as follows:\n   - Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\n   - People names: <comma_separated_list_of_people_names>\n   - Specific topics: <comma_separated_list_of_specific_topics>\n   - General themes: <comma_separated_list_of_general_themes>\n\n   In the chatbot's output, the \"people_names\" and \"specific_topics\" adhere to a placeholder \"-||-\" which does not match the description's required format. The \"company_names\" and \"general_themes\" do match the required format.\n\n2. **Incorrect Representation**: The description specifies that the list should be in a comma-separated format such as \"Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\". However, the 'outputs' section in the chatbot output denotes a different structure and description, which is inconsistent with the desired format. \n\n3. **Structure Issues**: No extraction comes following the textual content \"Text: {{text}}\" as part of the requirements, i.e., the breakdown under \"Text: {{text}}\" should have been:\n   - \"Company names: TSLA, Enel Green Power\"\n   - \"People names: -||-\"\n   - \"Specific topics: -||-, directionless\"\n   - \"General themes: Energy, Sustainability\"\n\nGiven these violations, the output does not follow the prescribed structure and formatting rules set in the description.\n\nERR"
