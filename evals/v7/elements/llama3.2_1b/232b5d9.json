Note that entity extraction might not cover all possible aspects of what can be extracted, especially for more complex texts with nested structures.\n\nReplace \"cities_name\" and \"projects_names\" according to the actual output of OpenAI API:\n \ncity_nam = f'''\n\" cities_name was referenced in discussions about smart city planning and architecture.

  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output does not comply with the description provided. Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Output Format Compliance**: The output should not be a Python script but should instead directly list the desired elements in the format specified in the chatbot's description:\n    ```\n    Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\n    People names: -||-\n    Specific topics: -||-\n    General themes: -||-\n    ```\n\n2. **Direct Extraction vs. Code**: The description specifies that the chatbot should directly extract elements from a given input text, not provide a script for how such extraction can be done via code.\n\n3. **Sample Data Manipulation**: The output includes placeholders (like `YOUR_API_KEY`, `projects_names`) and hypothetical execution steps, without providing the requested entity extraction directly in the specified format.\n\n4. **Lack of Extracted Elements**: The output does not show extracted company names, people names, specific topics, or general themes in the required formatâ€”instead, it provides a script demonstrating a potential approach to extraction without executing it and demonstrating results.\n\nFor these reasons, the output is not in compliance with the expectations and description provided for the task.\n\nERR"
