  "complianceText": "The desired output format, based on the chatbot description, should simply list the extracted elements in a specific manner without including inferred themes or additional context explanations. The provided output begins with an introduction phrase (\"Here's the analysis of the text:\") which is not part of the expected format. Each category, like \"Company names\" and \"People names,\" should begin with \"Company names:\" and \"People names:\" respectively, without additional narrative. However, the \"People names\" category has an additional description appended (\"Bestselling author of fantasy literature\") which is not required by the desired format and deviates from the described format. The \"General themes\" section includes inferences and explanations rather than a straightforward list of themes, which goes beyond simply stating the theme name as directed.\n\nERR"
