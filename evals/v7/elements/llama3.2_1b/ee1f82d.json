According to the desired format:\n- \"Company names\", \"People names\", \"Specific topics\", and \"General themes\" should all be followed by a list in a \"comma_separated_list_of_company_names\" style. \n- \"People names\", \"Specific topics\", and \"General themes\" should also have a similar comma-separated list format, rather than the format shown for \"People Names\" in the output received.\n\nThe output failed to provide a comma-separated list for \"People Names\" and used an incorrect format with a bullet point list. Furthermore, the output uses a \"-||-\" placeholder for \"Specific Topics\" and \"General Themes\" instead of a proper comma-separated list, even if the list is empty, it should be represented as an empty string.\n\nThese discrepancies between the received output and the required format lead to a conclusion of non-compliance with the description's requirements.\n\nERR"
