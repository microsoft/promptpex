  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output does not comply with the description provided. The description specifies a desired format for the output, with each category requiring a comma-separated list. Instead, the chatbot's output provides a list for company names, then writes a note about the format that should have been used for people names but doesn't apply it, and incorrectly formats other lists without using the comma-separated style as directed (i.e., \"-||-\").\n\nIn particular, the following violations are noted:\n\n1. The \"People Names\" section includes a placeholder text \"Person Name -||-\" instead of in the required format and does not properly adhere to the specified format of a comma-separated list. The note suggesting how to format multiple names is unnecessary and deviates from the desired format description.\n\n2. The \"Specific Topics\" and \"General Themes\" sections do not follow the specific requirement for a comma-separated list as indicated by \"-||-\".\n\nDue to these inconsistencies with the format specified in the chatbot description, the output is non-compliant.\n\nERR"
