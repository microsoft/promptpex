  "complianceText": "The output from the chatbot has several compliance issues with the description:\n\n1. **Company Names**: The output shows \"Netflix,\" which follows the format of a comma-separated list. However, there is a trailing comma after \"Netflix,\" which does not align with the expected format of neat comma separation with no extraneous commas.\n\n2. **People Names**: The output for people names uses prefix ‘-’ before each name (e.g., \"-Prince Charles\"). According to the desired format, it should use '-||-' to separate names without any prefixing or erroneous formatting.\n\n3. **Specific Topics**: It follows the format of a comma-separated list, which is compliant.\n\n4. **General Themes**: Similar to people names, the output here deviates from the correct format. It should use comma separation consistently, not just listing words without proper formatting.\n\nThe provided output indicates errors in formatting rules for 'People names' and 'General themes'. The consistent comma-separated list format is not upheld in all parts of the output. \n\nERR"
