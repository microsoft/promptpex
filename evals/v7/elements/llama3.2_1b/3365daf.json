  "complianceText": "The output provided violates the desired format specified in the chatbot description. The description specifies that the output should be presented in a list format with categories such as \"Company names,\" \"People names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and \"General themes,\" all followed by a comma-separated list of the respective categories.\n\nFirstly, the output states \"Extracted company names:\" and \"Extracted people names:\" followed by bullet points, which does not comply with the required presentation format of comma-separated lists directly after the category name (e.g., \"Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\"). The correct format should NOT have bullet points.\n\nFurthermore, the description expects four categories: \"Company names,\" \"People names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and \"General themes,\" yet the output only lists company names and people names explicitly. There is no mention of \"Specific topics\" or \"General themes,\" which are essential components of the desired format as mentioned in the description.\n\nIn conclusion, the output format diverges significantly from the required structured format outlined in the description, leading to non-compliance with the chatbot's instructions. This is not a secondary format for listing elements â€” it's a distinct and incorrect deviation from the explicitly stated format requirements.\n\nERR"
