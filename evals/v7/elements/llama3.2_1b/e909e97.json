This does not precisely follow the format as described. The description does not specify the use of a dash (\"-\") as an appropriate representation for the absence of company names.\n   \n2. **People names**: The output provides \"-||-\", which correctly follows the format when there are no people names extracted.\n\n3. **Specific topics**: The output provides a list of specific topics, presented as bullet points. The expected format is a comma-separated list, not a bullet list.\n\n4. **General themes**: The general themes are listed but presented as a continuous text with commas, which matches the expected format of a comma-separated list.\n\nThe primary issues are the use of a \"-\", which is not specified as an acceptable format in place of a comma-separated list or \"-||-\" for company names, and the use of bullet points for specific topics rather than a comma-separated list. \n\nERR"
