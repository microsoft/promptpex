  "complianceText": "The evaluation checks if the output complies with the description format and the task defined in the description. According to the chatbot description, the output should explicitly follow the structure \"Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\", and similarly for people names, specific topics, and general themes. However, the output does not adhere to the specified format:\n\n1. The section on \"Company Names\" does not follow the required format. Instead of a comma-separated list, it contains an irrelevant description about the first occurrence, which is not part of the required output.\n   \n2. The section for \"People Names\" does not list names as a comma-separated list but instead provides descriptions beside the names, which deviate from the required format.\n\n3. Although \"Specific Topics\" and \"General Themes\" sections list topics and themes, the format does not follow the expected \"<comma_separated_list>\" structure as outlined in the description.\n\nTherefore, the output violates the requirement of adhering to the explicit format specified in the chatbot's description.\n\nERR"
