The \"Company Names\" section complies with the format.\n2. The \"People Names\" section does not match the required format. It includes a parenthetical clarification, which is not specified in the description. The list should be a simple comma-separated list without additional annotations.\n3. The \"Specific Topics\" section is presented as a list but should be in a comma-separated format.\n4. The \"General Themes\" section is explained in a sentence format rather than a comma-separated list, deviating from the required format.\n\nBased on the adherence to the format specified in the description, the output does not fully comply.\n\nERR"
