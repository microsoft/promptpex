According to the description, the format should involve listing company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes as comma-separated lists within specific headers in this order:\n\n- Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\n- People names: -||-  \n- Specific topics: -||-  \n- General themes: -||-\n\nInstead, the output lists each category as a bullet point list, which deviates from the specified desired format. Moreover, the \"company_names\" category seems to incorrectly list people names under it instead of company names, revealing non-compliance in content categorization according to the description's order as well.\n\nERR"
