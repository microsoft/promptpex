  "complianceText": "The output provided by the chatbot does not comply with the description given. According to the description, the desired format should be:\n\n```\nCompany names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\nPeople names: <comma_separated_list_of_people_names>\nSpecific topics: <comma_separated_list_of_specific_topics>\nGeneral themes: <comma_separated_list_of_general_themes>\n```\n\nHowever, the chatbot output is formatted differently:\n\n1. The output uses a markdown style with titles \"Company Names,\" \"People Names,\" \"Specific Topics,\" and \"General Themes\" instead of the specified single-line output format.\n   \n2. The elements in each category (company names, people names, specific topics, general themes) are listed as bullet points instead of a comma-separated list.\n\nThese deviations from the desired format lead to the conclusion that the output does not comply with the description provided.\n\nERR"
