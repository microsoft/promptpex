According to the description, each category should be followed by a comma-separated list of items. However, in the output:\n\n1. \"Company Names:\" is not followed by a comma-separated list; instead, it uses parentheses incorrectly and lists only one item without commas for multiple entries.\n2. \"People Names:\" uses \"- || -\" correctly, as the description indicates this should be displayed if there are no people names extracted.\n3. \"Specific Topics:\" and \"General Themes:\" are provided as numbered lists, which is inconsistent with the format in the description that requires a comma-separated list.\n\nGiven these observations, the output violates the format specified in the description. Therefore, the evaluation concludes with:\n\nERR"
