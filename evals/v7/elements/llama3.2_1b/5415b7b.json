The description specifies that the lists for company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes should be in a \"comma_separated_list\" format. In the chatbot's output:\n\n1. **Company names**: There is an unnecessary use of hyphens around \"OpenAI\", which deviates from a simple comma-separated list format.\n2. **People names**: The names are separated by \"||\" instead of using commas, which does not comply with the specified format.\n3. **Specific topics and General themes**: These sections correctly utilize commas for separation, adhering to the format requirements.\n\nThese issues in format make the output non-compliant with the description provided. \n\nERR"
