  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not comply with the desired format in some areas. Firstly, the section for \"Company names\" and \"People names\" initially contains \"-||-\" or \"-\", which denotes no companies or people were found, but then further down, it lists company names and people names. This creates inconsistency and potential confusion regarding whether these entities exist or not. Secondly, there is no separation between the initial part and the subsequent part containing company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. The desired format should have used comma-separated lists without redundancy. Lastly, the general themes section is initially left blank before later listing \"global trade, globalization,\" which suggests an inconsistency in how themes are presented.\n\nTherefore, due to these discrepancies and inconsistencies, the output does not comply with the format stipulated in the description. \n\nERR"
