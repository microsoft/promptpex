  "complianceText": "The chatbot is expected to produce an output in a specific structured format. The specified format requires listing each element as a comma-separated list following the respective headings: \"Company names\", \"People names\", \"Specific topics\", and \"General themes\". However, the chatbot's output presents these elements as bullet points rather than a comma-separated list.\n\nHere's the reasoning behind the decision:\n\n1. The headings in the chatbot's output (\"Company Names\", \"People Names\", \"Specific Topics\", and \"General Themes\") are correctly aligned with what is specified in the description, but they are not followed by a colon and a single comma-separated list, which violates the desired format.\n \n2. Instead of a comma-separated list for each category, the chatbot uses bullet points for each entry in each category. The requirement is to present each category in a single line with elements separated by commas.\n\n3. Without knowing the input, the compliance evaluation can only focus on the format, which is incorrect here according to the specified pattern.\n\nERR"
