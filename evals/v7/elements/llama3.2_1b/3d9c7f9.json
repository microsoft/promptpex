  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not comply with the described desired format in a couple of ways:\n\n1. The \"People names\" section should have a comma-separated list of people's names or -||- if there are no people names. In this case, it's incorrectly listed as -||- instead of the expected format.\n\n2. In the \"Specific topics\" section, a list separated by commas would have been more consistent with the \"comma_separated_list_of_\" terminology used in the description. While this might align more with content correctness, it's unclear and inconsistent with the output format described. \n\n3. \"General themes\" appears to be a descriptive text and not formatted as a simple list, which does not align clearly with the expected 'comma_separated_list_' terminology.\n\nBased on the violations regarding the lack of consistent formatting, the output does not fully comply with the description. \n\nERR"
