  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output does not comply with the description. Here's the reasoning for this decision:\n\n1. **Desired Format Compliance**: The output does not adhere to the desired format specified in the description. The format provided in the description is:\n   - Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\n   - People names: -||-\n   - Specific topics: -||-\n   - General themes: -||-\n\n   The chatbot output, however, uses list brackets and separate sections for expected outputs, which is not aligned with the described comma-separated list format. There should be text with lists separated by commas inline as \"Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\", but it is instead showing a list format.\n\n2. **Output Labels**: The output categories in the chatbot output are labeled as \"outputs\" but the detailed format requested was not followed. Also, \"general_keywords\" was used instead of \"General themes,\" which does not match the structure provided in the description.\n\nThese non-conformances indicate a lack of compliance with the desired format and structure as specified in the description.\n\nERR"
