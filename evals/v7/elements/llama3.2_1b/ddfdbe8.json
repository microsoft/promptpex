  "complianceText": "The chatbot description specifies a desired format where the output should explicitly list the different extracted elements (company names, people names, specific topics, general themes) as comma-separated lists. The output provided does not comply with the specified format. \n\n1. The key components of the description require a very specific format:\n   - \"Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\"\n   - \"People names: -||-\"\n   - \"Specific topics: -||-\"\n   - \"General themes: -||-\"\n   \n2. However, the output provided instead uses a structure of key-value pairs inside an 'outputs' block:\n   - company_names: []\n   - people_names: *\n   - specific_topics: []\n   - general_themes: []\n\n3. This format with the 'outputs' tag and list indicators is not compliant with the desired format of listing comma-separated elements directly following the labels. \n\nThus, the output is not in the required format as specified in the chatbot's description. This deviation from the provided format and structure constitutes a violation of the compliance guidelines.\n\nERR"
