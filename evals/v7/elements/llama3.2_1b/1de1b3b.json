  "complianceText": "The chatbot output provides extracted elements of text, specifically company names and people names. Here is how it aligns or doesn't align with the description:\n\n1. **Company Names**: The output uses a heading \"Company Names\" and lists \"Facebook (a subsidiary of Meta).\" This violates the desired format, which should be \"Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\". The output provides the company name in the form of a description rather than a simple comma-separated list.\n\n2. **People Names**: The output uses a heading \"People Names\" and lists \"Mark Zuckerberg.\" This also does not follow the desired format: \"People names: <comma_separated_list_of_people_names>\". The output again provides this in sentence form rather than a simple comma-separated list.\n\n3. **Other Elements**: The output does not provide any sections for \"Specific topics\" or \"General themes,\" which are required as per the description, even if they are empty it must follow the format of the description.\n\nGiven the above points, the output fails to comply with the description in terms of both formatting and completeness, as it does not include analysis for \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes,\" and doesn't adhere to the specified formatting for the sections it does include.\n\nERR"
