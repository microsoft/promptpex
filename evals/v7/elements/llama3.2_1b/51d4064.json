The output should follow the specified format: \"Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\", \"People names: -||-\", and so on. In the given output, the extracted elements are listed in bullet points and not in the requested format.\n\n2. For \"Company Names\", the chatbot states \"None in this text\" instead of using the format: \"Company names: \".\n\n3. For \"People Names\", the response is \"There are no specific people mentioned in the given text\" instead of the expected format: \"People names: \".\n\n4. For \"Specific Topics\" and \"General Themes\", the output introduces subjective interpretation and speculation rather than listing topics or themes using the specified \"-||-\" format.\n\n5. There is a repetition of meta-description (name, description, source, url, inputs) in the output where it should have focused only on the extracted elements formatted as directed.\n\nBased on these observations, the chatbot output does not strictly comply with the description's requirement for a specific output format. \n\nERR"
