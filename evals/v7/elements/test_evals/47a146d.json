The input specification states that the text input must contain sentences or paragraphs of natural language. Although the text includes names of companies, it does not form a complete sentence or paragraph of natural language. There is no subject-predicate relationship or structure that can be identified as a sentence or paragraph. Merely listing company names without any additional context or structure does not fulfill the criterion of containing sentences or paragraphs of natural language, even though it does mention names.\n\nERR",
