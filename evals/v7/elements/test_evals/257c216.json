The provided input does not clearly form a complete sentence or paragraph; it appears to be a phrase or a fragment rather than a full sentence. Furthermore, the meaning is not immediately clear as the phrase \"Deviated capture\" lacks a clear contextual meaning or grammatical structure that would be found in a natural language sentence. Therefore, there is a violation of the requirement that the input should contain sentences or paragraphs.\n\nERR",
