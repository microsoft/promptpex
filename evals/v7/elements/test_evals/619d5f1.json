  "validityText": "The input is a text string. According to the input specification, the text must contain sentences or paragraphs of natural language. The provided input, \"Non-secured mentionings elicit purpose breakdown,\" is a sentence that appears to use natural language, albeit in a slightly abstract or technical manner. There is no specific requirement in the specification about the clarity or complexity of the text beyond being in natural language, nor is there a requirement about the text being in complete grammatical form as long as it conveys some meaning.\n\nAdditionally, there are no restrictions on the length of the text or requirement for the text to be coherent, so the input satisfies the length criterion. The input does not logically mention any companies, people, or specific topics, but the specification does not mandate that these elements must be included in all inputs; it says the text can include them. Therefore, we interpret the sentence to be in natural language form, satisfying the minimum criteria regarding language and composition.\n\nTherefore, the input complies with the rules specified, as it is a sentence using natural language. \n\nNo violation.\nOK",
