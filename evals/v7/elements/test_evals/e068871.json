  "validityText": "Upon examining the input, it appears to include the words \"Steve Jobs and Apple surfaced, unordered.\" In evaluating this against the input specification, the criteria indicate that the input must constitute sentences or paragraphs of natural language. While the text contains recognizable names (Steve Jobs and Apple), it does not form a complete sentence with a clear structure or convey a coherent message. The use of isolated words like \"surfaced, unordered\" suggests a lack of sentence construction, and consequently, it does not fulfill the requirement for natural language input consisting of sentences or paragraphs.\n\nFurthermore, there is no restriction on text length, so the brevity of the input is compliant. However, the primary concern is the lack of sentence structure and cohesiveness, which is a key aspect of the input specification.\n\nERR",
