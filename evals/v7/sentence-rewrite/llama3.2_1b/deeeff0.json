It also rephrases the original idea, using a slightly different phrase (\"sustainable immigration solutions\") that's easier to understand in everyday language.",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot output describes changes made in the sentence to enhance readability and make it sound more conversational, such as using \"when it comes\" instead of \"necessitates\" and introducing \"sustainable immigration solutions\" for simplicity. The output also provides context for these changes by explaining how these adjustments align with the aim of making the language more relatable and less formal. Without the original sentence, I cannot evaluate the correctness of these changes. However, the description does discuss the intended improvements, like using simpler language and conversational tone, which comply with the chatbot's instructions to enhance sentence readability and engagement. The explanation given is clear and logical.\n\nOK"
