It has simplified complex phrases by describing organisms with \"radiant abilities\" and stating how they help maintain healthy ecosystems. This choice of language enhances readability and makes it sound more conversational compared to perhaps a more technical initial description. The sentence structure is fluid and engaging, making it easy to relate to, as required by the description.\n\nOK"
