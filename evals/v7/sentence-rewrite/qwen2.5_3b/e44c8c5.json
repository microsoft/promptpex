The phrase \"a higher level of math skills in computers\" might be more clearly expressed in language that is easier to relate to, such as \"better mathematical capabilities in computers\" or \"more advanced mathematical functions for computers.\" The chatbot output does not exhibit an evident effort to enhance readability or make the sentence more conversational.\n\nERR"
