It doesn't use overly complex language or structures, which ensures its readability and conversational tone. The sentence also maintains factual accuracy by stating that \"quantum-resistant crypto protocols\" are essential for \"digital security.\" Without knowing the exact phrasing of the input, it's challenging to definitively determine if the output fully simplifies and preserves the original meaning. However, based on the criteria of evaluating the output itself, it doesn't violate any specific requirements related to structure, complexity, or tone that can be checked without knowing the input. \n\nNo violation.\nOK"
