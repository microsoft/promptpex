It engages the reader by discussing a topical issue, making the sentence sound fluid by linking technology with ethical considerations. However, without the input, we cannot directly assess if the original meaning is preserved, but the sentence does not contain complex phrasing or seem factually inaccurate. Therefore, based on the description, the output seems to comply.\n\nOK"
