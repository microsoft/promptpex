While I can't check if it preserves the original meaning or factual accuracy due to a lack of input, I can determine if it's readable and conversational. The sentence is clear and straightforward, expressing the importance of using quantum-resistant cryptographic protocols in a way that's easy to understand. The language is accessible, and the sentence structure is engaging enough for a general audience. Given these observations, there are no apparent violations of the chatbot description in terms of enhancing readability or making it more conversational.\n\nOK"
