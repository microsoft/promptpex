  "complianceText": "The chatbot output presents a rewritten sentence that seems to enhance readability and adopt a more conversational tone, which aligns with the chatbot description. The style is simplified, using familiar phrases like \"famous for helping to end apartheid\" instead of \"is known for his role in ending apartheid,\" which makes it more engaging and relatable. However, without the original input sentence, a complete evaluation of preservation of meaning cannot be assured, but that is out of scope for this evaluation. The structural changes promote fluidity, and factual accuracy appears maintained based on the information provided.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
