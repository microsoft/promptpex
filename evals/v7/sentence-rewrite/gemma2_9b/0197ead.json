This helps businesses adjust their advertising so it's more likely to get attention.\"**\n\n\nHere's what I changed and why:\n\n* **\"Leveraging artificial intelligence\"** is replaced with the simpler \"uses artificial intelligence\".  \n* **\"Predict consumer behavior patterns\"** becomes \"figure out how people will act as consumers\". This makes it easier to understand.\n* **\"Enabling businesses to tailor their marketing strategies effectively\"** is rewritten as \"helps businesses adjust their advertising so it's more likely to get attention\". This focuses on the practical result in a way that's more relatable. \n\n\n\nLet me know if you have other sentences you'd like me to make more conversational!",
